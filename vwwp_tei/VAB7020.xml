                        boom of the wide Atlantic, and looking into each other's eyes. A thriftless
                        occupation, but infinitely sweet. We had not grown tired of it yet, though
                        we had been married three weeks; our love was not even a shadow the less. It
                        seemed impossible for us to date its beginning; Heaven grant we may never
                        know its end!</p>

                        little month had passed since that dayâthe day of days!âwhenâ But I will

                        goldenly on this happy heart of mine.</p>
                    <p>I had been ill for a long timeâindeed, from my youth up I have rarely known
                        the blessing of continuous health. But though this circumstance gave a
                        languor and a half-melancholy dreaminess to my whole character, I think,
                        too, it made me more humble, more loving, more thankful for all the love
                        which was showered upon me. And when my long illness came, this blessing
                        increased tenfold. I heard people compassionate âpoor Wilfred Mayer,â and
                        say how hard it was that a young man should have the strength and glory of
                        his youth brought thus low. I did not feel it so; I knew that there was
                        power, aye, and beauty, in my soul; and I cared not for the feeble body.
                        Besides, I lived in such an atmosphere of love. There was my father; my
                        bold, frank-hearted brother, younger than I, yet assuming all the tender
                        protection of eldership; Hester, the most loving of sisters; and one, dearer
                        than any sisterâLilias Hay.</p>
                    <p>But the dayâthat day! In the morning I, feeble always, seemed feebler than
                        ordinary. I lay back in my arm-chair, listening to the soft pattering of the
                        April rain upon the window-sill, without any connected thought, except a
                        fear that the weather might keep Lilias Hay in-doors: and I did not like to
                        miss seeing her, even for a day. I heard the sound of an opening door; but
                        it was only the physicianâaccompanied by a second, whom I had not seen
                        before. I<pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7020-006"></pb> was disappointed, and paid little
                        heed to either, until I noticed that they drew my sister aside, and spoke
                        earnestly. While she listened, Hester turned pale, looked at me, and began
                        to weep. Her tears seemed to fall on my heart like ice-drops, piercing me
                        with a shuddering dread. I felt, I knew, that that smooth-tongued stranger
                        had, with his calm, stolid lips, pronounced my death-doom.</p>
                    <p>And I must die! The Shadow, hovering near me so long that I had ceased to
                        regard it, was then close at hand-its very breath was upon me! <emph>I MUST
                            DIE</emph>!</p>
                    <p>Hester came to my side with the second physician. I looked fixedly upon
                            <emph>him</emph>, my doomer. I believe I said some words which betrayed
                        my thoughts; for he answered, with a bland, cheerful smile, âthat I must not
                        imagine anything so serious; a voyage, perhaps a summer in Madeira, would
                        soonââ</p>
                    <p>I turned away; I would hear no more of the smiling lie. Thank God, it was not
                        breathed by Hester's lips! No; she only wept, and kissed me once or twice
                        softly.</p>
                    <p>âIn a week he must go!â I heard the physician whisper. Then I knew there was
                        no hope. They went away, and left me alone.</p>
                    <p>I tried to think of peace, of religion; I tried to say, âThy will be done;â
                        but the strong writhings of human passion shut out from me even the face of
                        God. To die, to leave all my dear ones, to part from Lilias Hay!âI uttered
                        her name almost with a groanâthe thought was horrible. In this fearful
                        moment I knew<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7020-007"></pb> how madly, how despairingly, I
                        loved her. She knew it, too, though I had never told her so. There was no
                        need. The deep tenderness between us had grown from year to year, until it
                        became a part of our life. I say <emph>our life</emph>; for we seemed to
                        have but one. Neither said, âI love;â but the daily tide of our existence as
                        it flowed harmoniously on, cried out with its thousand voices, âSee, how
                        these two love one another!â</p>
                    <p>I had hitherto been content that it should be so, knowing well that Lilias
                        would wed no man save me, and that one day the loving friendship between us
                        would be changed for a closer bond. But now I must dieâdie without having
                        called her wife, without even having taken her once to my heart. O misery!
                        that blessed, long-dreamed-of moment would never come; I must go down into
                        the dark grave; I must lay my head in the dust <emph>there</emph>, and not
                        on the pure, faithful bosom of my Lilias Hay!</p>
                    <p>I groaned aloud; I writhed in my anguish. Life and youth were yet strong
                        within me. <emph>I could not die</emph>. Sometimes I resolved at all hazards
                        to tell Lilias of my love. Perhaps I might draw life from the lips of my
                        betrothed; perhaps a wife's prayers might yet stand between me and the
                        Destroyer. I would risk it! I would ask her to wed me nowâat once. What,âwed
                        youth with sickness, peace with misery, life with death? God forgive the
                        sinful thought! No; rather let me die alone, with dumb lips that carried
                        their eternal secret mournfully to the grave. Best soâbest even for
                            <emph>her</emph> sake.</p>
                    <pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7020-008"></pb>
                    <p>I grew calmer. My frozen despair melted into a dew of tears. I began to pray
                        the prayers that my dead mother had taught me when I was a child. They made
                        me feel like a child now, peaceful and humble. When Hester came in again, I
                        was able to look in her face and smile. She did not weep, but talked with me
                        calmly and affectionately, about my journey. I said I would rather remain at
                        home; but she prayedânay, they all prayedâthat I would embrace any chance
                        that might spare me longer to their dear love. I promised. Then my sister
                        left the room, and brought in Lilias Hay.</p>
                    <p>Lilias was very pale, but composed and tearless. She came and sat down beside
                        me, in her usual place. I laid my hand on her lap; she took it, and held it
                        for a long time without a word.</p>
                    <p>âYou know all, Lilias; that I am going to Madeira?â</p>
                    <p>âYes.â</p>
                    <p>I marvelled, nay, I was almost pained, that she said no more. My Lilias! I
                        did not know thy heart even then!</p>
                    <p>They were all in the room: my father, Charles, Hester, and one who was to be
                        Hester's bridegroom that very month. As they began to consult as to who
                        should accompany me on this voyage of doom, young Fortescue drew her nearer
                        to him with an anxious look. Hester cast her eyes down; but I saw the
                        struggle in her heart. I would not put the claim even of a dying brother
                        before that of an<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7020-009"></pb> affianced husband. I said
                        I would rather have Charles with me; and, after some resistance, Hester
                        assented. They soon went away, and left me, as they often did, alone with my
                        friend Lilias.</p>
                    <p><emph>My friend</emph>! Was it friendship, when her every tone, her very
                        movement, caused my heart to thrill, even through the cold sluggish pulses
                        of disease. How keenly I suffered! How I yearned to lay my cheek on the dear
                        hand I held, and pray her to take my poor dying head to her bosom, and let
                        my last breath utter the life-long love which on earth might never be
                        fulfilled. But I uttered it not. Even when, speaking of my going away so
                        soon, her words came brokenly, and she leaned her brow against my chair in a
                        long tearful silence, I only laid my hand softly on her hair, and bade âGod
                        bless her.â Better, I thought, that she should mourn as a
                        <emph>friend</emph> than as a widow.âLilias, my faithful one, was I right?</p>
                    <p>Then we talked in a quiet, ordinary way, about my journey and its
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <p>âHester will go with you, surely; of course, Hester must go,â said Lilias.</p>
                    <p>âNo, Hester must not, ought not,â I answered earnestly. âNothing should
                        divide two who love one another.â And then I trembled at my words, and I saw
                        Lilias tremble too. But soon after she spoke of some indifferent subject,
                        and continued to do so until the time came for her to go home. We bade each
                        other âgood-nightâ (we dared not say âgood-byeâ), parting as usual with the
                        long, lingering hand-<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7020-010"></pb> clasp only. She walked
                        slowly to the door, her step seeming to me like the rending of soul and
                        body. Whether by gesture or groan I betrayed the agony I know not; but
                        Lilias turned round. The next moment she had flung herself on her knees
                        beside me.</p>
                    <p>âWilfred, Wilfred! in life or death I cannot part with you. Hush!ââand her
                        voice grew solemn with unutterable tendernessââdo not speak. Let me say the
                        truth, long known to us bothâthatââ But she could not say it. Only she
                        caught my handsâwildly, fondly, fastââOh, Wilfred! do notânay, you shall not
                        go alone. Friend! lover! <emph>husband</emph>! take me with you!â</p>
                    <p>I fell forwardâmy head on her shoulder. My lips asked feebly and blindly for
                        the holy seal of troth-plight. I felt itâthe first pure kiss of Lilias Hay;
                        and then I felt no more, but sank into a swoon of joy.</p>
                    <p>It lasted not long; for with returning consciousness came that iron will of
                        self-martyrdom, which would have made me die with my love unspoken: I lifted
                        myself from her enclasping arms.</p>
                    <p>âLilias,â I cried, âthis must not be. You would give me life, and I
                        youâdeath. I dare not take the boon.â</p>
                    <p>She arose; quick blushes diffused her face and neck, and then faded away. O
                        love! my faithful love! I could dream I saw thee now, leaning over me with
                        that white marble brow, and low, solemn voice.</p>
                    <p>âWilfred, you think of yourself aloneâyou have not remembered
                        <emph>me</emph>. Your love is my lifeâyou have<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7020-011"></pb> no right to take that from me. If I must suffer, betterâbetter a thousand
                        times that I should suffer with you than apart.â And she sank once more on
                        her knees beside me. âOh, Wilfred! my only comfortâmy only hope in this
                        worldâcast me not from you. Let me be your wife, to watch, tend, and cherish
                        you, untilâuntil you go away, and then to followâsoon, oh, soon!â</p>
                    <p>I opened my arms, crying, âLilias, come.â And thus, in one long embrace,
                        silent as deathâor love, we plighted our troth to each other.</p>
                    <p>A week after I and my <emph>wife</emph> were in the midst of the wide ocean,
                        on our way to Madeira.</p>
                    <p>Reader, you do not wonder now that it was almost heaven to me to lie silent
                        on the twilight-shadowed deck, doing nothing, save look into the eyes of my
                        Lilias.</p>
                    <p>They were eyes, now bright with hope as well as love: for it seemed as though
                        the shadows of doom were passing away from mine. I drank in the soft breezes
                        of the southern sea; they gave me new life, as all said. But I knew, O my
                        wife! that this new life was brought by that precious love of thine.</p>

                <div type="chapter">
                    <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="b">IT</hi> was a pleasant voyageâby day under the sunny heaven, by
                        night beneath the stars. Many a time Lilias and I sat for hours together on
                        the deck, hand<pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7020-012"></pb> in hand like little children;
                        pleased with the veriest triflesâa cloud on the sky, a flying fish on the
                        waterâtalking sweet idleness, half sense, half nonsense, as loving and happy
                        ones ever will; and then my wife would shake her head with a mock reproof,
                        and say, we ought to be ashamed of ourselvesâwe, burthened between us with
                        the conjoined weight of nearly fifty years. She was so happy, that she even
                        used to sport with me, sometimes jesting about my having compelled herself
                        to become the wooer at last. She kept buzzing about me like a merry little
                        bee, her blithe voice lulling me either by song or speech, until, still
                        feeble, I often sank to sleep on the deck, with my head on her lap. And
                        then, many and many a time did I wake, feeling my hair wet with the dew of
                        passionate tenderness which had rained on me from those dear eyes. âThank
                        God, thank God, for the blessedness of love!â was all my heart could cry.
                        But thus it did cry, day and night, in a loud pÃ¦an of joy that even angels
                        might hear.</p>
                    <p>Friend reader, I dare say thou thinkest we were a couple of simpletons! We
                        smile on thee calmly. Poor fool! thou hast never loved.</p>
                    <p>One night we watched the twilight into starlight, and could not tear
                        ourselves from the quiet, lonely deck. It was a strange and awful thing to
                        be sweeping in the darkness over that vast, desolate sea, with not a sound
                        near us, save the flapping of a sail and the wind in the cordage singing
                        almost like a human voice, or one which, though all spiritual now, yet
                            comes<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7020-013"></pb> laden with the echo of its
                        remembered mortal wail. Our converse partook of the character of the scene,
                        and glided from the sweet trifling of contented earthly love, into the
                        solemn communion of two spirits, wedded not only for life but for
                        immortality. We spoke of the deep mysteries of our being, of the unseen and
                        immaterial world. All these things were ever to me full of a strange
                        fascination, in which Lilias shared. Why should she not? All our lives we
                        had thought alike, she following whither I led. But she ever walked meekly,
                        knowing that the man is the head of the woman. Her wisdom was born and
                        taught of love, as a woman's should be. And to me it brought not weariness
                        but strength; I thanked Heaven that the wife of my bosom was also the wife
                        of my soul!</p>
                    <p>In the midst of our talk there came by our only fellow-passenger, a German
                        doctor. He startled us both, as he moved from behind a sail, the setting
                        moon lighting up his always pallid face and long, gray hair. He seemed to
                        us, in our present visionary mood, almost phantom-like in his appearance.</p>
                    <p>Lilias started, and then laughed. âIt is only Herr Foerster. Let us speak to
                        him.â</p>
                    <p>âNo,â I said, for I did not like the man. He was a mystic. He vexed me with
                        his wild aspect, his floating locks, and his perpetual harangues about Kant
                        and Swedenborg, and Jacob BÅhmen. Dear Lilias combated my prejudice in her
                        own gentle way. Where I condemned the eccentric philosopher, who hung out<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7020-014"></pb> his wisdom as a sign to catch men's eyes,
                        she pitied the strange old man, half-mad, and wholly desolate.</p>
                    <p>âSee, Wilfred, how wistfully he is looking out over the waters. We know not
                        what sorrowful thoughts may be in that poor brain of his. You will let me
                        speak to him, dearest?â</p>
                    <p>She had her way, for it was the right way, and I knew it. In a few minutes
                        the old German was sitting with us, inclined to begin his fantastic lore.
                        But the mood had changed since yesterday, and his speech was less mystic,
                        and more full of dreamy poetry. I was thankful that he had forgotten Kant.
                        As his countenance lighted up, and his speech grew earnest, I began to feel
                        that there was sincerity even in his eccentricities, and method in his
                        madness.</p>
                    <p>âYou were standing mute and absorbed when I spoke to you, Herr Foerster,â
                        said Lilias. âWere you thinking about home?â</p>
                    <p>âI have no home.â</p>
                    <p>There was scarcely any sorrow in his eye or tone. He had passed these human
                        weaknesses.</p>
                    <p>âBut I was watching for a home, a true homeâone in search of which I have
                        traversed these seas for ten years. I shall find it some timeâI know I
                        shall.â</p>
                    <p>Lilias looked at him compassionately; and then glanced involuntarilyâfirst to
                        the sea, then upwards to the starry, steel-blue sky.</p>
                    <p>âNo: you mistake;â and the old mystic shook his head with a half-scornful
                        smile, âI seek nothing so vague as that: I have no wish to die. Perhapsââ<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7020-015"></pb> and his voice grew mysteriousââPerhaps I
                        never may die.â</p>
                    <p>My wife crept nearer to me, and gazed earnestly on the man whom I now thought
                        surely mad; but there was no sign of frenzy in his manner. Reassured, Lilias
                        again spoke.</p>
                    <p>âWhere and what is this homile you seek?â</p>
                    <p>He pointed to the young moon just dipping into the western sea, amidst a bank
                        of fantastic cloudsââLook there! do you not see beyond that pale crescent,
                        where sea and sky meet, a luminous verge, resembling white hills and shining
                        towers? <emph>Resembling</emph>, did I say? Nay, it is! That is the very
                        spot I seekâthe land beyond sunsetâthe Island of the Blest.â</p>
                    <p>Surprised and somewhat startled by his sudden vehemence, neither Lilias nor I
                        made any answer. He went on, changing abruptly from the energy of enthusiasm
                        to the calmness of eager reasoning.</p>
                    <p>âYou will doubt this, I know. You will think me mad. Many have done soâbut I
                        smile at them. The same was said of the great Ithacanâof Columbusâof other
                        noble spirits who have set out on a like track.â</p>
                    <p>âBut none have ever found its ending, Herr Foerster,â said I. âNo man ever
                        yet reached the Island of the Blest.â</p>
                    <p>âRather say, no man ever came back from thence. How should he?â And the
                        German smiled a calm superior smile. As he went on, his plain, well-arranged
                        arguments almost staggered my doubts as to his insanity. His speech was so
                        like truth.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7020-016"></pb>
                    <p>âMen in all ages have believed in the existence of this land. Legends,
                        variously modified by different ages and climes, have all agreed in this
                        universal fact, that far westward, in the midst of the vast mysterious
                        ocean, untraversed and untraversable by man, lies an island, whose dwellers
                        have all joys of humanity without its painâall the sensuous delights of
                        earth, combined with the purity of heaven. Who knows but that the angels
                        carried God's Eden and planted it there in the midst of the sea?â</p>
                    <p>âThis faith is very beautiful,â said Lilias, attracted even against her will.
                        âI had rather believe thus, than believe that the divine gardenâtrodden of
                        angels, visited by Godâwas transformed into a howling wilderness.â</p>
                    <p>I could not but smile at her graceful fancy; but the influence of this
                        strange man was upon me also. âYou say, Herr Foerster, that this belief has
                        extended over all ages. How so?â</p>
                    <p>âIs it not among the Greeks? Listen to Homer.â And with his grand, rich
                        German accent, he poured out in kindred strength a torrent of that majestic
                        Greek, which was in truth worthy to be the speech of Olympusâ</p>
                    <q>
                        <l>âThe large utterance of the early gods.â</l>
                    </q>
                    <p>âIt sounds glorious,â murmured Lilias; âbut I am a woman, and have only a
                        woman's learning. I should like to hear it in our English tongue.â</p>
                    <p>Herr Foerster obeyed.</p>

                    <p>We did indeed sit listening, in a silence that was not without awe. The
                        scene, the hour, the gestures and tones of this man, carried with them a
                        supernatural influence. More and more he spoke, collecting with infinite
                        learning every mythical fable that could suggest or confirm this belief; the
                        story of Ulysses, who sailed far into the wild desert of waters in search of
                        the land beyond the sunset; the Roman superstition of the Island of
                        Atlantis, which ancient<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7020-018"></pb> fable, if fable it
                        were, had left its impress on the Atlantic; the legends of mediÃ¦val lore,
                        that spurred on to enterprise a Columbus and a Gama; the fantastic romance
                        concerning the âhappy land of Faerie,â the Island of Avalon and its
                        dwellers, once of earthâKing Arthur, Sir Launfal, Ogier le Danoisâall these
                        fanciful creations of history and fiction were brought together by our
                        companionâenthusiast, or madman, whichever he wereâwith a reality utterly
                        astounding.</p>
                    <p>âYou see,â he continued, âthat each legend coincides in one factâthe Happy
                        Islands that lie in the western sea. Universal fable proves individual
                        truthâat least, I believed so; and when the world became desolate to me, I
                        turned my thoughts to a new landâthe land of the blest.â</p>
                    <p>âYou have suffered, then,â whispered Lilias' tender voice.</p>
                    <p>âFew men long so ardently for another world, as they whose hope is gone from
                        this. But I must not speak of these things now: all are pastâlong past. Why
                        did you make me think of them? Youâoh, you twain have no need to seek the
                        Happy Isles.â</p>
                    <p>He drooped his face a moment, and then went on, harshly and wild as before.
                        âI dreamed this dream, night and day, until I was convinced it was a truth.
                        I squandered all my wealthâfor whom should I keep it?âand then set sail. Ten
                        years, ten long years, have I spent on these seas, passing from ship to
                        shipâsuffering famine and drought, fire and wreck; yet never, oh! never have
                        I touched the land of the blest.<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7020-019"></pb> But, hark
                        you!â and he caught my handââI know they are here, in this very ocean. I see
                        theme sometimesâat sunset, or at dawn, far off in the horizon they never
                        come nearer. But they will come near: ah, yes! I know that some day I shall
                        find the Happy Isles.â</p>
                    <p>He stretched his clasped hands towards the ocean in full confidence of faith.</p>
                    <p>âPoor dreamer!â I thought. âAre they wise or madâto be envied or pitiedâthe
                        many who, like thee, toss blindly on the world's dark sea, vainly seeking
                        the Happy Isles?â</p>
                    <p>But I had not time for more speech; for suddenly there seized me a racking
                        pain, darting arrow-like through breast and brain. It was the fore-warning
                        of sufferings I well knew of old. They came upon me, thronging thick and
                        fast, sharp rending pains which lowered my manhood to the shrieking agony of
                        a child. And there, alone beside me, sat the faithful one who had followed
                        me over the seasâtrue woman, true wife! Thank Heavenâit was her thought as
                        well as mineâthank Heaven! that she <emph>was</emph> my wife now; that it
                        was hers to fold her cool hands round my brow, to gather me to her bosom as
                        a mother would a sick child. Every form and phase of tenderest
                        loveâsister-love, mother-love, wife-loveâseemed mingled into one, and poured
                        out upon me from the heart of my Lilias. I knew nowâwould that every man on
                        earth knew!âhow infinite a faithful woman's love can be!</p>
                    <p>Stronger and stronger grew these torturing pains,<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7020-020"></pb> until my senses became dim. I scarce felt even
                        the winding arms of my Lilias, until they were removed, and I perceived
                        bending over me the German mystic. He spoke, I thought, of some rare drug
                        which would surely lull my sufferings.</p>
                    <p>âIt is very fearfulâthis new power!â answered Lilias.</p>
                    <p>I heard <emph>her</emph> voice, every tone.</p>
                    <p>Those around her spoke a few words. I only knew their effect by her
                        convulsive shudder and smothered cry; but soon after she saidâ</p>
                    <p>âHerr Foerster, you are a good man; I trust you with my lifeâmore than my
                        life, remember! Let my husband try this, and God be merciful to him and me!â</p>
                    <p>The German stooped down. To my distempered fancy his eyes appeared to flame
                        like demons', and his tongue to hiss in her earâ</p>
                    <p>âYou have no fear?â</p>
                    <p>âNo!â she replied.</p>
                    <p>âIt is wellâand you are wise! Two hours more of these tortures, andââ</p>
                    <p>I heard no more; but as he went away I felt Lilias shiver; she drew me closer
                        to her, and kissed passionately my lips and eyes. I strove to speak, but my
                        mind would not concentrate itself so as to frame one intelligible sentence.
                        The German came back. He knelt before me, and I perceived a faint fragrance
                        that diffused itself on the air I breathed. One struggle I made to convince
                        myself that all was realâthat I was clasped safe in my wife's armsâand then
                        I gave myself to the delicious<pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7020-021"></pb> numbness
                        which stole over me. My eyes closed; the gathering lights that flitted
                        before them disappeared: it was as though some spirit hand were folding over
                        sight and hearing a dim, gray veil. A few times I felt my heart booming up
                        and down, like a creature of life; I seemed almost to behold it beating in
                        my bosomâits great pulses heaving continually louder and higher, like waves
                        of the sea; and once or twice I distinguished those rending painsâpains
                        darting lightning-likeâpains that could be seen as well as felt: for in this
                        strange spell all the various senses seemed to be confounded and mingled.</p>
                    <p>Then all grew peace. Closer and closer gathered over me the solemn veil: one
                        by one my heart's leaping pulses sank lower and lowerâas if dull fingers
                        pressed them into stillness. All pain ceased, and with it all perception of
                        being. I faintly stirred my hand, to convince myself of my bodily existence.
                        I tried to make my lips express the thoughts which dwelt in my still
                        conscious mind.</p>
                    <p>âI sleep, Lilias, I sleep!â It sounded less like my own human voice than that
                        of a spirit; but it was answered.</p>
                    <p>âYes, my own dearest, you will sleep soon.â Then all the outward world became
                        dimâthe sounds and sights about me fading as earth-landscapes fade before
                        one who voyages through the air, rising higher and higher, until cities,
                        towers, and treesâare all an undistinguishable mass. Thus I seemed to soar
                        out of my bodily organs into a new existence. All sensation <choice>

                        I seemed to feel no need of vital air. My heart lay still; but its hushed
                        pulses gave me no pain. I no longer bore the burden of a weary body: it was
                        as though I had become incorporeal, and had passed out of the world of
                        matter into that of spirit.</p>
                    <p>I said to myself, âThis is death!â but the thought found no echo on my
                        lipsâthey would not give forth one sound. Then I knew more clearly the
                        change that had taken place. It seemed at first that I was really
                        deadâbecome a disembodied spirit. Yet my soul was not free from the clay
                        which it no longer had power to animate into living and breathing man. It
                        roved hither and thither, within its lost tabernacle, and could not flee
                        away. My brain yet maintained power of thought and perception; through it I
                        heard, and saw, and felt, though my outward senses were benumbed. Then, when
                        the first delicious torpor had gone by, there came upon me a vague horror.
                        Could it be that I was dead, yet not deadâa tranced body tenanted by a
                        living soul? Was this my fearful doom?</p>
                    <p>It broke upon me with the first sound conveyed by my incorporeal sensesâthe
                        cry of my wife Lilias! Then I heardâwhat no man on earth ever heard before<choice>

                    <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="b">IN</hi> a dark cabinâaround all coldness, silence, deathâthey
                        left me; me, still me, for the eternal essence had not quitted, could not
                        quit, its clay tenement. I knew all they did to meâthe demons, with that
                        arch-demon looking on, smiling at his horrible work! I felt it allâmy
                        palsied limbs being straightened, the dead-weights laid on my eyes, my
                        helpless hands decently composed;âwith my spirit's senses I saw and heard
                        every whit, and yet my corporeal life was gone. Wonder, rage, terror, swept
                        over my soul as vainly as blasts over a frozen lakeâno sound, no movement,
                        enabled the bodily organs to reflect the mind; I had power over them no
                        more.</p>
                    <p>The German with his fellow-ministers left me, and I lay wrapped in terrible
                        repose. I, of all human flesh, was the first who had <emph>felt
                        death</emph>. There was a marvel, a mystery, even a pride, in this awful
                        thought. I shrouded myself in it, and, piercing through the terror and the
                        gloom, my soul went travelling over every phase of wild speculation. I, the
                        immortal, indivisible <emph>I</emph>, looked down almost pityingly upon that
                        poor atom of helpless mortality that was myself. It was a dear selfâdear,
                        with all its imperfections; for it was the human form which Lilias held
                        precious, even beautiful. The pale, powerless head she had cherished on her
                        bosom; the cold, nerveless hands had lain, hour after hour, enfolded
                        tenderly in hers.</p>
                    <p>They were so folded once more; but it was the frenzied clasp of the widow,
                        not the wife.</p>
                    <pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7020-024"></pb>
                    <p>She cameâLilias, my beloved; her footsteps sounded through the stillness of
                        the death-chamber; her sobs pierced the darkness of the desolate night. Oh,
                        fearful spell! that not even such a cry could break!</p>
                    <p>I knew her hand was upon my pulseless heart; I knew her kisses were showered
                        on my dumb lips; yet I could not answer; no more than the corpse which I
                        appeared. A veil, far wider than that between the dead and the living, was
                        drawn between me and the beloved of my soul. How I longed to rend at once
                        the feeble thread that linked me to mortality, and passâthrough any agony,
                        soever greatâinto the state of a disembodied spirit. Then, perchance, I
                        might hold communion with her, as the departed are sometimes permitted to
                        do.</p>
                    <p>She would not believe that the life had entirely gone from my poor shrouded
                        form. She wrapped the cold hands in her bosom; she laid her cheek beside
                        mine on the same pillow; and so, weeping bitterly until her strength failed,
                        she fell asleep. But she awoke soon, calling wildly on my name. Oh God! I
                        would have almost perilled the immortal soul Thou gavest me to answer her.
                        Why, thou Divine, didst Thou make this terrible human love so strong?</p>
                    <p>Lilias, shuddering, let my hands fall. <emph>When they fell</emph>, impassive
                        as clay, she uttered a cry such as would almost have broken a death-slumber.
                        It could not break mine.</p>
                    <p>She seized the lamp, and held it so that the light fell on my face. There was
                        one start, one gasping sigh, and then she stood calm. Over her terror, her
                            grief,<pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7020-025"></pb> her despair, had passed the
                        awful peace given by the presence of Death.</p>
                    <p>She laid down the light, moving slowly, with hushed steps. Then she came, and
                        knelt down, not by my pillow, but at the couch's foot. She kissed me no
                        more, she clasped me no more; I was no longer her living husband, I was the
                        solemn image of Death. That image froze her human love into mute awe. Her
                        tears ceased, her sobs were stilled. For a moment she hid her face as if to
                        shut out from sight the dead face, once so beloved; and then she paused. It
                        was beloved still! But as she gazed, there was in her look less of
                        passionate earthly love than of the sublime yet awful tenderness with which
                        one would behold an angel of God or a departed soul.</p>
                    <p>After a while, Lilias lifted her voice and prayedâthe widow's first prayer.
                        Yet it began with a thanksgiving. She thanked Heaven for all I had been to
                        her; for the love which had awakened her girlhood's soul, calling into life
                        its strength, joy, and beauty; for the blessed fate which had worked out, in
                        due time, that love's fulfilment, so that every dower of her rich heart
                        might be poured in a full tide on him who was its awakener. No murmurings
                        were there for the love taken away; but blessings for the love that
                            <emph>had been</emph>.</p>
                    <p>âAnd thou, my husband!â she cried, âmy own beloved! who art not here, not in
                        this form lying cold before me, but now standing a spirit among the immortal
                        ones, glorious and beautiful as they, forsake me not! Live thou in my heart;
                        change this human anguish into<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7020-026"></pb> memory
                        peaceful and divine! Love me, love me, up in heaven as I love thee on earth!
                        Oh, thou who wertâwho artâmy soul's soul, through life and
                        <emph>after</emph>, what shall part thee from me!â</p>
                    <p>She lookedânot down towards the pale figure beside which she knelt, but
                        upwards into heaven. Thither her lifted hands were stretched, thither her
                        eyes were turned; and I, yet prisoned in that dull clay, mourned not that
                        she regarded it no more, but rejoiced in the immortal strength and purity of
                        the devotion which had loved, not my poor dying body, but <emph>me</emph>.</p>
                    <p>There came faces and voices to the door, and Lilias arose. She arose, not the
                        weeping, broken-hearted girl, stricken and desolate, but the widow of the
                        deadâcalm, patient, almost sublime in her sorrow. Many pitying friends
                        gathered round her; there was only one which stole in the rear, glaring at
                        her and at me from amidst his gray elf-locksâthe Destroyerâwho had worked
                        upon us this doom.</p>
                    <p>They besought Lilias to take some rest; but she meekly refused. Covering my
                        face, she took her seat at the head of what she deemed her husband's corpse;
                        and there remained, motionless and mute, a solemn watcher over the living
                        Dead. At last, her human strength yielded to this weight of woe; she sank
                        down, slowly, slowly, on the breast that could shelter her no more. Falling
                        thence she lay a dull, unconscious heap on the cabin floor.</p>
                    <p><emph>It</emph> marked her, even there, that flaming, fiendish eye. It
                        watched her everywhereâher and me. Creeping<pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7020-027"></pb>
                        snake-like into the chamber, the Mystic gathered her in his foul clutch,
                        indifferently, as though that precious form had been some victim slain by
                        his hand. He bore her away, with a triumphant smile; and I, her husband,
                        bound in adamantine bonds, lay a living spirit prisoned in a dead corse.</p>
                    <p>Again I was alone. The wind rose, and the ship rocked madly on the deep. I,
                        lying there, might have been a stone. All sense, all power, was dead within
                        me. Only the brain was aliveâalive with sight, and sound, and perception.
                        Phantom after phantom rose, peopling the vessel's hold. They danced in the
                        darkness, like motes in a sunbeam; they shrieked in the blast, a whirlwind
                        of unearthly voices; they filled the very air, the air that I had once
                        breathed.</p>
                    <p>Thus I lay amidst these horrors, until a human presence, more demon-like than
                        themselves, put them to flight. The German Mystic came and stood over his
                        victim.</p>
                    <p>Love had been powerless to unloose the spell; how then should Hate have
                        strength to break it? I, who would have heaped worlds upon worlds to crush
                        my enemy, soul and body, into ashesâwas doomed to lie still as a sleeping
                        babe, while his cursed fingers wandered over my dead heart, my sunken pulse;
                        while, in his ghastly mirth, he bent my helpless limbs, making me assume
                        mocking attitudes of life.</p>
                    <p>At last, he dropped upon my lips some liquid, and my tongue felt itself
                        unloosed. I howled upon him imprecations, threatenings, prayers; but he only
                            smiled!<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7020-028"></pb> I shrieked, until I thought the
                        sound might pierce to the ocean's depths; and still he only smiled.</p>
                    <p>âPoor deceived one, it is vain!â he cried: âthy voice rings no louder than
                        the sigh of a summer wind. No human ear could hear it, save mine, which is
                        deaf as the rock. I must work my will.â</p>
                    <p>He laid his finger on my lips, and they were sealed as with an iron band. He
                        began to speak once more.</p>
                    <p>âListen, thou dumb one who hearest all! Against thee I bear no malice, no
                        revenge; thou art but my instrument to work out the great end. Through thee
                        I must find the Happy Isles. Thou, whose bliss on earth seemed so secure
                        that it took from thee all desire for heavenâthou art the one chosen for
                        this work. Therefore, I must send theeâa living, trance-bound human soulâto
                        the place where the dead lie; to the unfathomable depth of the great sea,
                        that there, perchance, thou mayst discover the way to the Land of
                        Immortality.â</p>
                    <p>At this my soul within me sent up a cry, such as might have risen to the
                        crystal walls of heaven when the Son of the Morning fell. But it could not
                        pass my frozen lips.</p>
                    <p>âPatience, poor struggler against destiny!â answered that voice of doom, and
                        yet it now seemed not fierce but pitiful, even mild. âIs it so hard that
                        thou, who hast been most blessedâwho, loved and loving, hast found earth a
                        very heavenâshouldst sacrifice a few years more of an existence that haply
                        may soon become<pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7020-029"></pb> wretched as mine, in order
                        that a fellow-being, equal to thyself in all but happiness, may exchange a
                        life which to him has been a long torture, for rest and peace?â</p>
                    <p>His voice became plaintive, nay, humble. But I saw only the hand that rent
                        from me love, hope, life, and I cursed him still.</p>
                    <p>âI hear thy unspoken thoughts,â he replied. âBut they avail not. Thou hast no
                        pity on meâme on whom neither God nor man ever took pity. Thou hast no
                        tenderness for thy brother-man, towards whom the human eye was never turned
                        in love. Now, then, I stand as an avenger. I make thee a sacrifice for all
                        the suffering and outcast of thy kind. Thou shalt go first, and find out the
                        pathway on which they may follow to the land of peace. It is just, and I am
                        a righteous instrument to fulfil this doom. The time is at hand.â</p>
                    <p>While he spoke the hurricane rose louder and louder, and amidst its boomings
                        came the din of clamorous voices, calling aloud that the dead should be
                        brought forth. The sea would not rest, they said, until it had received its
                        lawful prey.</p>
                    <p>The Mystic met them at the cabin door. âIt shall be done now, at once, while
                        the widow sleeps. Poor mourner! It will save her one parting pang the less.â</p>
                    <p>He was a demon incarnate, with that cast-down eyeâthat silvery tongue!</p>
                    <p>They swathed meâ<emph>me</emph>âliving me, in the cerements<pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7020-030"></pb> of the grave; they bore me, a loathed weight, to
                        the poop. There, out in the midnight blackness, they stood, unconscious
                        murderers; <emph>he</emph> leading them on. Above the howl of the seething
                        waves, I heard his low voice breathing the mockery of a funeral prayer. A
                        lifting upâa plungeâand I sank down, downâinto the yawning ocean-hell.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">I BELIEVE</hi> that death itselfâthe real parting of soul and
                        bodyâis less horrible than many tortures, not only mental but corporeal,
                        which we endure during life. Many a man has dreamed that he was dyingâhas
                        felt vividly all the circumstances of that supreme hourâthe gradual ebbing
                        away of existence, or the passing suddenly from life into eternity. May it
                        not be that this kind of dream, in which we rarely suffer any pain, whether
                        seeming to die slowly or by violence, is but the striving of the spirit
                        within us to foreshadow the moment of its departure; to make known, in the
                        only possible way, the solemn secret which none who have passed death's
                        portals can ever return to unfold?</p>
                    <p>Thus I died, if death it could be called, as softly, as painlessly, as one
                        dies in dreams. âIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,â the change came.
                        I sank down, down into an abyss of blackness, silence, and nothingness! and
                        then I rose up-rose like a bird,<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7020-031"></pb> or a cloud
                        in the air. I beheld light, I heard sounds. I felt a life within me; richer,
                        fuller, than any human life. Around me was neither void, nor spiritual
                        heaven, nor terrible hell. It was earthâearth purified into Paradise.</p>
                    <p>I stood on the shore of the Happy Isles!</p>
                    <p>As the sunshine of that blessed land fell on me, my grave-cerements seemed to
                        melt off like misty robes of air. With them melted the icy spell which had
                        bound me. Once again I moved and breathed like living manâlike that man of
                        men who rose up beneath the finger of God from the life-pregnant dust of
                        Eden.</p>
                    <p>As glorious as Eden itself was the land whereon I stood. Words cannot picture
                        it. Perchance you may form the best image of its beauty, when you look up at
                        those cloud landscapes which grow visible on summer-eves, and talk to your
                        little son at your knee about the heavenly country which he dreams is
                        something like that which his young eyes behold in the pictured sky. No
                        other earthly similitude can approach so near to this vision of the Happy
                        Isles.</p>
                    <p>Around them the sea folded itself like a girdle, a crystal circle,
                        encompassing them with wide and loving arms, like Infinity. For there,
                        Infinity and Eternity, the great mysteries into which the deepest and purest
                        human faith cannot pierce without trembling, became near and familiar
                        things. Still, the land was not heaven, but earthâearth with its curse<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7020-032"></pb> taken away, and made pure and beautiful as
                        it was in the Eden-time.</p>
                    <p>I walked with human feet along the lovely shore. I gazed with human eyes upon
                        the view beyondâa region of pastoral, untrodden beauty, blue hills rising
                        sky-wards, feathered down to the very strand with trees. The land, though
                        unlike any which I had known on earth, was such as I had pictured many a
                        time in fancy, when dreaming over that time of which Homer and Hesiod
                        sungâthe time when Hellas, the garden of the young world, was trodden by
                        gods, demi-gods, and heroes.</p>
                    <p>It seemed that I beheld the golden age of Greece. On these purple hills the
                        Latmian shepherd might have rovedâamidst these thick woods Oreads and Dryads
                        might have made their happy bowers. The sea itself, azure-shining and
                        crystal-clear, seemed to catch its brightness from myriads of Nereid-eyes
                        below, and the breeze that went sighing by was less an earth-wind than the
                        audible breath of Zephyrus over his goddess-love.</p>
                    <p>Now I discerned the beauty of those ancient mythsâsuited to the time when the
                        world was in its childhood, and needed to be taught by childish
                        parablesâwhich spiritualized all nature in poetic symbols, and filled the
                        whole earth with the dim presence of half-understood Divinity.</p>
                    <p>I, too, felt within myself the spirit of the golden age. I was a Greek. I
                        bounded over the strand, my bosom swelling with immortal fireâsuch as the
                            great<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7020-033"></pb> and glorious Titan poured into
                        the soul of man. Life, young life, leaped in my veins; not that dull current
                        transfused through eighteen hundred yearsâbut the rich flood, sensuous yet
                        pure, which coursed through the grand frames of the ancient heroes. I
                        walked, I leaped, I ran; feeling no longer the pain and weakness of the body
                        I had once borne, but a strength and beauty akin to that of the conqueror
                        Theseus, or the goddess-born son of Peleus.</p>
                    <p>Up from the sea-shore, across a sloping hillâsuch an one as might have
                        blossomed beneath the footsteps of Paris and his woodland bride, ere Enone's
                        wail had made fair Ida itself a place of desolationâup, higher and higher, I
                        climbed; until from the hill summit I looked down on the scene below.</p>
                    <p>It was a deep vale, amphitheatred by forest and mountain. There, as in a nest
                        of peace, dwelt the beings who peopled this new world; I saw them
                        alreadyânot with narrow human vision, but with an eye that seemed at once to
                        behold and to know. They were human in semblanceâin beauty superhuman. Their
                        speech was music; their smile was sunshine: their very presence was an
                        atmosphere of joy. But it was a joy such as immortals feelâcalm, deep,
                        tranquil. They had the power, never known on earth, to look on the noon-day
                        sun of happiness with undazzled and unblinded eyes.</p>
                    <p>I stood on the mountain-top, and stretched forth my arms with a gesture of
                        glad and yearning desire. The rising sun cast my shadow, dark and grand in
                        its giant<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7020-034"></pb> outline, upon the Happy Vale.
                        Then I heard arising a billowy sound of many voices, swelling into a hymn.
                        It came pealing on in the majestic cadences of Homer's tongue, and its
                        burthen evermore ran thus:â</p>
                    <p>âRejoice, rejoice! Another mortal has reached the Happy Isles!â</p>
                    <p>Winding up from the valley, the graceful procession neared me. Old men
                        advanced first, rich in the beauty of ageâfor age has beauty as well as
                        youth. Wisdom, peace, and tranquil thought, dwelt on each grave brow; the
                        light of their eyes, though dimmed, was not obscure. Life's evening
                        descended upon them in gray-clouded peace, bringing no regret nor fear.</p>
                    <p>Next came womenâaged matrons, with their children's children clinging to
                        their robes; young mothers, to whom mother-love was unmingled with fear, for
                        their offspring would go down to the graveâif graves were hereâsinless as on
                        the day of birth. Then advanced Manhoodâstrong, mighty in stature, the
                        perfect type of physical beauty, ennobled by the indwelling beauty of the
                        soul. After this full development of humanity came young men and maidens,
                        meek, tender, modest, who carried in their bosoms the rose of love; but it
                        was a thornless rose. Last of all were seen the childrenâinfant buds,
                        wherein lay folded the perfect man.</p>
                    <p>These all cried aloud, with one voice of jubilant song, âWelcome! welcome to
                        the Happy Isles!â</p>
                    <p>In the midst of them I passed on to the centre of the valeâa palace of
                        verdure, branch-roofed, and fretted<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7020-035"></pb>
                        overhead with azure and goldâthe blue sky and the darting sunlight. There
                        was seen no work of men's hands.</p>
                    <p>Neither was there a throneâthe ruler stood among his people like a father
                        among his children. His only show of sovereignty was that which nature
                        stamped upon his mien and gesture. These tokens pointed silently, âBehold a
                        king among men!â</p>
                    <p>He <emph>was</emph> a king! I felt it as I looked upon him. He stood among
                        them, loftiest in stature, grandest in beauty. It was meet that he should be
                        so, for in this perfect land the symbol and the reality were one; the
                        outward manifestation was complete as the inward truth. Therefore this
                        kingly soul shone forth through a kingly semblance.âThe temple was worthy of
                        the god.</p>
                    <p>I say <emph>god</emph>, because there was something god-like in him. Perhaps
                        the best type by which I can embody him is the Phidian Joveâbut it was Jove
                        unthroned, uncrowned, save by the circumfluent presence of his own deity.</p>
                    <p>I bowed myself before him, even to the ground, and my soul within me bowed
                        likewise. He raised me, repeating the words of the choral salutation,
                        âStranger, <choice>
                            <sic>whomsoever</sic>
                            <corr>whosoever</corr>
                        </choice> thou art, welcome to the Happy Isles!â</p>
                    <p>I have often thought that if there be one physical manifestation in which the
                        indwelling divinity of manhood most shows itself, it is the human voice.
                        From the moment I heard his voice I could have worshipped at the feet of
                        that king. In its majestic sweetness was<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7020-036"></pb> a
                        pensive under-tone; speaking of endurance, but endurance sublimated into
                        peaceâof wisdom, but wisdom made holy by meeknessâof power, but power
                        softened by love.</p>
                    <p>âO thou Greatest One,â I cried, âtell meâwho art thou?â</p>
                    <p>He smiled: his smile was like that of Jove, which makes earth to laugh in
                        sunshine.</p>
                    <p>âAskest thou this? Then, thou art not yet equal with us; but I will make thee
                        so.â</p>
                    <p>He placed one hand on my brow, the other on my heart; and his eyes looked
                        solemnly into mine. An influence seemed to pass into my soul, raising me to
                        a higher state of being. Hitherto, my existence had been one of mere
                        sensation, like Adam's with the tree of wisdom untasted. In the deepest and
                        most delicious sense, I had learned <emph>to feel</emph>âI now learned
                            <emph>to know</emph>.</p>
                    <p>I sank before him, crying out,â</p>
                    <p>âThou art the greatest, the wisest, of ancient heroes, the bold adventurer
                        into unknown seas. Hail Ulysses, King of Ithaca!â</p>
                    <p>The monarch lifted his head with a noble pride. âI <emph>was</emph> King of
                        Ithaca; I <emph>am</emph> Ulysses. That name, which the Divine Spirit caused
                        to be much honoured on earth, follows me here. My petty kingdom is
                        forgotten; but Ulysses, the true Ulysses, reigns in the Happy Isles. And
                        thou, O man! tell us,âfor our knowledge extends not beyond these lands,
                        whence comest thou?â</p>
                    <p>I strove to answer the question; but a thick oblivion<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7020-037"></pb> seemed to have gathered over my past life: only,
                        as I gazed listlessly on the crowd that watched me with curious eyes, I saw
                        two young lovers stand, leaning in each other's arms. The sight brought a
                        passing gleam of remembrance, and then a sharp pang of regret.</p>
                    <p>âO King! all is dim with me; but it seems that I have been happyâhave known
                        love. I cannot rest, even here. Let me go back to earth once more.â</p>
                    <p>âIs it even so?â And he cast on me a look of sublime compassion. âDrink peace
                        and oblivion with the dews of the Happy Isles!â</p>
                    <p>He drew me beneath the spreading branches, and shook from them a shower of
                        pearly drops, which fell, sweet as honey, on my lips and brow. As they
                        touched me, I ceased to suffer and regret, and became altogether blessed.</p>
                    <p>I sat at the feet of the wisest of the Greeks while he judged his people.
                        Little need of judgment was there, when there was no crime, and only enough
                        of cloudy sorrow to show more clearly the eternal sunshine of happiness
                        around them. They gathered round their king, drinking wisdom from his lips,
                        and learning the few arts and sciences that their rich world needed. He
                        blessed the young, he counselled those of maturer years, he spoke peace to
                        the aged. As they departed each their several ways, I inwardly marvelled at
                        many things concerning them, which even now seemed a mystery.</p>
                    <pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7020-038"></pb>
                    <p>âUlysses,â I cried; âI, too, would fain learn of thee!â</p>
                    <p>The king bent his head in acquiescence.</p>
                    <p>âTell me, then, of these thy peopleâdid they journey with thee to the sunset?
                        And if so, how is it that some are young, some aged? Is there birth and
                        death here?â</p>
                    <p>He led me to a little distance, where stood a magnificent tree. Its branches
                        bore at once foliage, flowers, and fruit. Of its leaves, some wore the
                        tender green of spring, some the gold or ruddy hue of autumn; and as they
                        fellâfor they did fallâeach, touching the earth, became a seedling plant,
                        and so recommenced a new and different existence.</p>
                    <p>âHere,â said the sage, âas the life of a tree, is the life of men: peacefully
                        flow their fourscore years and ten; then they bid adieu to those they love,
                        fall calmly asleep, and in that slumber the soul passes from the worn-out
                        body into that of a new-born babe. Thus it is with the native dwellers in
                        this land.â</p>
                    <p>âBut with those thou leddest from Greece, and with thyself?â I asked, gazing
                        on the majestic form of perfect manhood, on which no added year might have
                        passed since Calypso's immortal eyes, tear-dimmed, watched it disappear
                        along the island-shore.</p>
                    <p>The Ithacan answered,â</p>
                    <p>âMen's souls differ from one another in greatness. I and my followers, though
                        mortal, bore within us the germ of immortality, which gave us will to seek,
                        and strength to find, the Happy Isles. Therefore, it needed<pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7020-039"></pb> not for us to pass through a succession of lives
                        in order to attain perfection. We are already perfect.â</p>
                    <p>âThen to thee and thine comes no change; but the body, now made the complete
                        manifestation of the soul, is immortal as itself?â</p>
                    <p>âEven so. Now, come hither and behold!â</p>
                    <p>Still following him, I entered a pleasant glade, thick sown with amaranth and
                        asphodel. Through it ran murmuring a little stream, in whose mirror looked
                        the pale flower that wastes for love of its own image.</p>
                    <p>There was neither sun nor moon; but the whole atmosphere was pervaded with a
                        serene twilight, like that of the dawn of day. It showed the quiet vale, and
                        the countenances of those who dwelt therein. They were men of various mien;
                        but over all was spread the same air of purity, happiness, and rest. The
                        stalwart soldier leaned on his useless weapons; the poet, sitting on the
                        flower-enamelled grass, sang his innocent songs, happy as a little child;
                        the sage, lying calmly beneath the tree-shadows, found his deepest wisdom in
                        the enjoyment of perfect peace.</p>
                    <p>It was a picture of the world's sinless infancy, when it lay, as a babe does,
                        soul and body alike wrapped in slumbrous stillness. Would an awakening come?
                        Or was this the culmination of existence?</p>
                    <p>As the idea crossed my spirit, I looked upon my guide. His face, too, wore
                        the same expressionâthat of a soul which, desiring nought, or else having
                        nought to desire, finds its struggles and sufferings merged into entire
                        contentment.</p>
                    <pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7020-040"></pb>
                    <p>In this Elysium, there seemed to be no future;âbut was there a past? I turned
                        unto the king, and said,â</p>
                    <p>âTell me, Ulysses, have these all drunk of the Lethe dew, and lost the memory
                        of their former life?â</p>
                    <p>âNo!â he answered; âbut they see it pictured dimly and painlessly like a
                        remembered dream.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd thou?â</p>
                    <p>His countenance shone with sublime triumph.</p>
                    <p>âTo me the past is sweet as the remembrance of toil in rest: I look on it
                        calmly, rejoicingly, as the victor of the goal looks back on the ended
                        race.â</p>
                    <p>So saying, the Ithacan turned from the entrance of the vale, and went on, I
                        following his footsteps, to the margin of the sea.</p>

                        towards the vast ocean which had served as a pathway to his hero-feet. It
                        kissed them now in tiny wavelets, obediently acknowledging his sovereignty.
                        The moist touch seemed laden with some passing memories of earth; for the
                        king stretched forth his arms and criedâ</p>
                    <p>âOh, life long past! oh, toils long conquered! oh, land long forsaken! must I

                        feet, looked up with wonder and reverence to the face of the son of Laertes.</p>
                    <p>âWisest of the Greeksââ I began.</p>
                    <p>âThou sayest right,â interrupted he. âI was the wisest of the Greeks. The
                        great gods poured wisdom into my soul when I yet hung upon the bosom of
                        Anticlea. As a child, I yearned for the might and energy of youth; as a
                        youth, I desired to attain the full knowledge of man. But when manhood came,
                        the sceptre of Laertes only cumbered my hands; and the petty realm of Ithaca
                        confined my soul.</p>
                    <p>âThe wise men said to me, âSon of Laertes, waste not thy strength in idle
                        dreaming. Emulate Hercules and Theseus: take in thine hand arrow and spear,
                        and rid the land of monsters.â And the young men whispered, âGo forth with
                        us, let us fight against men, and take captive fair women; this is glory.â
                        But I knew that both voices were false: I felt within me something beyond
                        the glory of the hunter or the warrior. So I stayed, vainly chafing at the
                        limits of the narrow island.</p>
                    <p>âAt last a vision came to meââGo,â it said, âwed the daughter of
                        JoveâHelenâmost beautiful of all the women of earth. Mingle thy mortal blood
                        with that of divinity, and thou shalt become thyself divine.â I believed the
                        deceitful dream, self-created out of the longings of unsatisfied youth; I
                        went and stood with the princes of Greece at the court of Tyndarus.â</p>
                    <p>Ulysses paused: and I, whose memory, while a blank<pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7020-042"></pb> as regarded my own past, went side by side with
                        that of the mighty Ithacanâcried: âTell me of that perfect type of womanâthe
                        ideal of beauty to the ancient worldâtell me of Helen of Troy.â</p>
                    <p>âHelen of <emph>LacÃ¦dmon</emph> rises before me now,â answered Ulysses. âShe
                        stands veiled at the foot of the throne. Around her are the young warriors,
                        thirsting with ambition and eager love. Love! what was love to me? I sought
                        not the fairest woman in Greece, but the being, Jove-born, whose embrace
                        might impart unto my mortality the power and wisdom of the god.</p>
                    <p>âThe veil was lifted: Helen stood revealed. The warriors knelt entranced
                        before her. Fools! to mistake that incarnation of voluptuous human beauty
                        for the divine Woman, the child of Jove! I turned away, half in sorrow, half
                        in scorn, and wooed no more the daughter of Leda.â</p>
                    <p>âBut the son of Laertes returned not without a bride,â I said, earnestly
                        regarding the face of the king. Wisdom sat thereâplacid yet stern, unbending
                        firmness, and indomitable will; but there was no sign of human tenderness. I
                        saw that in the great Ithacan's soul an insatiable thirst for knowledge had
                        filled the place of love.</p>
                    <p>He answered carelessly:ââMy people said it was meet a woman should sit by the
                        hearth of Ulysses, to tend the age of Anticlea, and bring up sons to mount
                        Laertes' throne. So Penelope sailed with me in the black ships to Ithaca.â</p>
                    <pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7020-043"></pb>
                    <p>There was a silenceâduring which the little waves sang their under-melody,
                        until it grew into the boom of the rising tide. The sea dashed and foamed
                        against the rocks that confined it; and its loud roar sounded mournful even
                        in the Happy Isles.</p>
                    <p>Ulysses beheld, and a new spirit dawned in his majestic eyes. âChild of the
                        after world,â he cried, turning suddenly round, âthou seest in that sea the
                        image of my soul. It would notâcould not stay murmuring among the golden
                        sands: it must rise and rise, even though it dashed itself howling upon the
                        bitter rocks. I sat, an enslaved king, upon my paltry throne, holding sway
                        over the human beastsâfor they were soulless as beastsâto whom the purple
                        and the diadem made me appear divine; I ruled them, and then scorned myself
                        for stooping to such a dominion. Why was I thus pent up within the limits of
                        my narrow isle?âI for whose aspirings the world itself appeared too bounded
                        and too small.â</p>
                    <p>âYet,â I answered him, timorously and softly, âwhen the summons came, the
                        monarch of Ithaca used his wisdom for a stratagem, rather than depart with
                        those who warred for Helen, against Troy. Why did the kingly warrior pretend
                        madness, and sow salt on the sea-shore?â</p>
                    <p>A look, as like human anger as that immortal face could assume, darkened the
                        brow of the king. âBecause the folly of mankind forced greatness itself to
                        cunning. Was it meet that Ulysses, gifted in the wisdom of the gods, should
                        go forth with a barbarian race to quarrel<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7020-044"></pb>
                        over an adulterous woman? But fate is stronger than human will: and so I,
                        with my twelve ships, sailed for the Phrygian shore.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd thou wert among the mightiest there?â</p>
                    <p>âI was <emph>the</emph> mightiest! Wisdom is greater than valour. It was I
                        who ruled the wavering Agamemnon, and led the virgin-sacrifice to Aulis. I,
                        by my counsels, caused the destruction of Troy.â</p>
                    <p>As he spoke, there came before my mind's eye a vision of the pillaged city,
                        the murdered Priam, the aged Hecuba grovelling in her children's gore. And I
                        said, mournfully, âAlas, for Troy!â</p>
                    <p>The face of Ulysses expressed neither triumph nor compassion, as he answered.
                        âTroy fell: it was destined that she should fall. The will of the Supreme
                        must be accomplished. The world's tide must swell onward, whether men,
                        cities, or kingdoms, lie engulfed in its course. Greece learned wisdom from
                        that ten years' miserable war; and from the ravaged town may have arisen a
                        new and a greater Ilion.â</p>
                    <p>âIt hasâit has!â I answered, thinking of Eneas whose descendants builded
                        Rome, and longing to impart the knowledge to which the wisest of the ancient
                        world had not attained. But his impassive look asked it not. The perfection
                        of his Elysium seemed to be, <emph>never to desire</emph>. Instead of
                        speaking of a future which to him was indifferent, I pursued my questions
                        concerning the past.</p>
                    <p>âGreat Ulysses! to thy ten years before Troy succeeded another period of
                        greater glory stillâthe glory<pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7020-045"></pb> of endurance.
                        Let me bow, heart and soul, before the patient wanderer over many seas, the
                        hero struggling with destiny, conquering alike the jaws of Scylla and the
                        Sirens' songâenslaved neither by fear, ambition, nor love;â and here I
                        paused, doubtful, remembering fair Circe's isle.</p>
                    <p>But the king answered unmoved. âIf ever love subdued me, it was an immortal's
                        love, which I thought might lift my being and endow it with something
                        divine. But even Circe's charms were laid at my feet: I sought them not. And
                        the winds that wafted our flying ship from the enchanted isle, testified
                        that wisdom and virtue were dearer to Ulysses than the clasp of a goddess's
                        imploring arms.â</p>
                    <p>âYet when the end was gained, the travail past, and the son of Laertes
                        reached his native land, did that wisdom and virtue find their perfect
                        fruition in happiness and peace? Else wherefore did thy bold feet quit for
                        ever the Ithacan shore?â</p>
                    <p>Ulysses advanced a few paces, and lifted his hand in the attitude of speech.
                        He stood as he might have stood before the throne of Agamemnon, his lips
                        dropping words sweet as honey, but strong and all-subduing as the wine which
                        Hebe poured out for Jove.</p>
                    <p>âI was a man before my age. I discerned faintly a higher life than that of
                        brute warfare and sensual pleasure, and turned with loathing from my
                        brethren. I sought this diviner life everywhereâin the renown of battle, in
                        the purer glory of travails conquered, in<pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7020-046"></pb>
                        the delights of a goddess's love. But wisdom, which is alone happiness, ever
                        flitted before me like a vain shadow: it was no nearer to me in Circe's or
                        Calypso's island than in the gore-encrusted fields of Troy. So I turned my
                        footsteps and sought it in my own home. I gave laws to my people; I taught
                        them the lore of distant lands; I stooped my warrior's hand to guide the
                        plough and melt the ore; I spoke of that wisdom which is better than
                        physical prowessâof peace, which is more glorious than war.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd they rewarded thee?â</p>
                    <p>âThey muttered among themselves that fame had lied, and that the returned
                        Ulysses was the same madman and coward whom their fathers had seen sowing
                        the shore with salt. And throughout the isle men lived like brutes; each
                        lifting his hand against his brother, as though Ulysses had never reigned in
                        Ithaca.â</p>
                    <p>âAlas!â I murmured. âWoe for him who is the herald of a coming age! But
                        surely there was peace and content by the hearth of the returned spouse, the
                        noble father, the duteous son? Surely there was rest for thee amidst thy
                        kindred?â</p>
                    <p>He replied, calmly as ever; âA great man often finds no kindred but the gods.
                        So it was with me and mine. I walked with them; I was not of them. Laertes
                        looked on me and marvelled, as Typhon might have done at the monster
                        offspring which called him sire. Anticlea âwas not.â Pale shade of
                        mother-love, thou at least in thy solemn Hades hadst<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7020-047"></pb> acknowledged thy Ulysses! Telemachus, dull
                        follower of a past age's lore, with nought of fiery youth save its
                        presumption, sought to guide into safe proprieties the errant sceptre held
                        by his father's daring hand. Good he wasâtender too; but the aged eagle
                        despises the filial cares of the hooded crow. Ulysses was alone still.â</p>
                    <p>âYet Penelope?â I began inquiringly.</p>
                    <p>âPenelope sat by the hearth and span.â</p>
                    <p>In that one sentence, where the only reproach was indifference, I read the
                        sole atoning plea for the husband who once more quitted, and for ever, a
                        wife faithful for twenty years. I saw before me the fair dull embodiment of
                        virtuous inanities, fulfilling the lifeless round of conjugal and maternal
                        duty, scared with horror at the bold soul that, over-leaping the world's
                        boundary of assumed right and wrong, would fain dive for itself into the
                        mysteries of the divine and the true. I knew how it was that not even the
                        coldly-faithful Penelope could keep her lord within the bounds of Ithaca.</p>
                    <p>âBut,â I cried, âtell me how the end came; and how it was that thou and thy
                        crew set sail for the Happy Isles?â</p>
                    <p>Ulysses paused, and a rapt expression, which might be either memory or
                        prophecy, arose in his eyes, which were fixed on the distant cloud-hung
                        main.</p>
                    <p>âI see my palace, as on that day of brutal feasting, when, moved to scorn and
                        wrath, I stood in the midst, and called them beasts. They proved the
                            justice<pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7020-048"></pb> of the name. They rose up
                        against the hand that fed them: they would have torn asunder the only true
                        man in Ithaca. Cowards! I hear their howling now. I see the white face of my
                        son Telemachus, pleading caution, expediency, while on the other hand arise
                        Penelope's weak railings against her rude, iron-hearted lord, whom she
                        deemed the cause of all. But I stood up, among fools and beasts, <emph rend="sc">A MAN</emph>âthe man who had conquered gods and monsters,
                        earth and hell-Ulysses.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd Ulysses was victor once more,â I cried eagerly.</p>
                    <p>âGo, ask the Ithacans, if Ithaca yet exist, concerning the aged monarch,
                        whose age was more glorious than their puling youth. With me, to fight was
                        to conquer. I crushed them like dust under my sceptre, and then I cast it
                        among themâI would be no more their king.â</p>
                    <p>âWhat followed?â</p>
                    <p>âI gathered from far and wide those tried companions of my ancient glory who
                        yet breathed the upper air; neither them nor me did the dull world
                        understand. Gladly they arose at their chieftain's summonsâgladly they
                        prepared to follow Ulysses to the West. Once more the old ship rocked in the
                        bay, and on every aged cheek the sea-wind blew, alluring with delicious hope
                        across the unknown wave. Thus Ulysses departed.â</p>
                    <p>âBut it was in peace?â</p>
                    <p>âAy, in peace! From the tomb of Laertes to the strand did the crawling slaves
                        track these footsteps,<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7020-049"></pb> even with
                        acclamations. The new-crowned head of Telemachus was bent for my blessing,
                        and Penelope herself followed me to the shore. Her countenance expressed
                        demure regret, but her eyes were bright, and not with tears. I saw that ere
                        the prow had turned from the land, she likewise had turned away, hurrying
                        joyfully to where the released people cried, âLong live the King
                        Telemachus!â He was a meet king for them.â</p>
                    <p>âEven so, O great Ulysses! And thouââ</p>
                    <p>âI looked on Ithaca no more; but stretched my sail towards the boundless
                        expanse of waters, when I might attain my full desire. So the shore faded
                        from us for ever, and we sailed on and on, night and day, towards the
                        sunset, until we reached the Happy Isles.â</p>
                    <p>As Ulysses ceased, the sublime calm of his countenance deepened more and
                        more. There was scarcely need for the question that burst from my lipsâ</p>
                    <p>âAnd they are, indeed, the <emph>Happy Isles</emph>? Thou art perfectly
                        blessed?â</p>
                    <p>âSeest thou not I am,â replied the king. âHere all desires are fulfilledâwe
                        have wisdom, peace, virtue, glory, together with every delight of sense
                        exalted into purity. We have no longings unattainedâwe live a life like that
                        of childhood, one delicious present.â</p>
                    <p>âBut the future?â I said, as a doubt crossed my mindâa doubt that was not
                        reflected in the countenance of Ulysses.</p>
                    <p>âI understand not thy words,â he said.</p>
                    <pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7020-050"></pb>
                    <p>âDost thou desire noughtâexpect nought? Is there not even here a something
                        beyondâan Infinite, whereunto the soul may lift itselfâa perpetual Future?â</p>
                    <p>âWhat is the Future?â said the king's calm voice.</p>
                    <p>Then I knew that I was in an Elysium where there was no to-morrow. My spirit,
                        born in later time, possessed a power greater than that of the greatest in
                        the elder worldâtheir heaven was sensuous delight and rest; mineâ?</p>
                    <p>I knew not, as yet, what it was, or in what sphere of being. I only knew that
                        I was different from those among whom I moved. As Ulysses left me, passing
                        with slow, majestic footsteps across the shining sands, I felt that there
                        was something wanting even in this Paradise. The sea appeared no longer a
                        loving guard, but a crystal barrier, awful even in its beauty. And when the
                        moon roseâlooming out of the waters like a thing of life, coming
                        fromâwhither?âthere rushed back upon me the eternal secret, the thirst for
                        the mysterious Beyond.</p>
                    <p>I lay beneath the shadow of the rock, immersed in thoughts too deep to belong
                        to the Happy Isles, but appertaining to another state of existence. Whether
                        that existence had been, or was to be, I knew not. The moon climbed higher
                        in the heavens, spanning the far sea with a glimmering bridge of light: it
                        drew nearer and nearer, until it reached my very feetâa silver pathway
                        leadingâwas it to Infinity or Nothingness?</p>
                    <p>Should I arise and follow? The impulse dawned,<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7020-051"></pb> strengthened, grew into a madness. The Island of the Blest, the peaceful
                        valeâall faded from me. I yearned for something to hope forâsomething yet to
                        come. I looked at that unsubstantial, dazzling line, and then at my own
                        material frame, which, though spiritualized and made beautiful, bore yet a
                        human likeness. Dare I walk the waves with mortal feet?</p>
                    <p>I dare! for each earthly particle is interpenetrated with my immortal soul.
                        Faith, and Will, and Infinite Desire, can accomplish all things.</p>
                    <p>I turned one look on the beautiful land, sleeping beneath the curtain of
                        nightâthen I set my foot on the living line of radiance.</p>
                    <p>That immortal pathway sustained my immortal feet! On it I walked over the
                        fathomless abyss, on, onâwhither?</p>
                </div>
                <div type="chapter">
                    <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="b">OUT</hi> into the dim obscure, guided and sustained only by that
                        slender moonlight line, I passed without fear. As I went, olden thoughts
                        entered my mind; and this strange journey seemed a shadowing of something on
                        earthâsome wild ocean of fate, to be crossed by one pale ray.</p>
                    <p>Gradually the moon set, and the path was gone!</p>
                    <p>I felt it vanish from beneath my feetâwith the darkness came imminent death!
                        I cried out aloud, and the<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7020-052"></pb> cry brought to
                        me the knowledge that I had passed into another sphere of beingâfor, lo! in
                        my despair I called upon Godâthe Christian's God!</p>
                    <p>At once, in a moment, the abyss of darkness was ablaze with light, showing me
                        that I had almost reached the land. Looking up, I saw on the near shore a
                        palace whose splendour lightened the whole isle, and glimmered even on the
                        waves. But amidst these waves I was struggling still. I saw afar off life,
                        safety, bliss, and yet Death was ready to engulf me.</p>
                    <p>There rose to my lips words faintly remembered as being known of old, solemn
                        and holyâ</p>
                    <p>â<emph>What shall I do to be saved</emph>!â</p>
                    <p>But still around me the greedy waves hissed and roared. Then the cry at my
                        heart changed to one humble, helpless, yet not hopelessâ</p>
                    <p>âLord, what wilt Thou do, that I may be saved?â</p>
                    <p>Instantly I saw a light boat crossing the seething waters. In it stood a
                        youth, pale, beautiful; serene and holy of mien as he who abode at
                        Patmosâthe beloved apostle John. Again I cried, and the answer wasâ</p>
                    <p>âBrother, peace! Help is near.â</p>
                    <p>Then, his blessed hands lifted me out of that yawning grave, and I sank
                        before himâsaved!</p>
                    <p>He made on my forehead the sign of the cross, sayingâ</p>
                    <p>âWelcome, brother! This is the island of Avillion, where dwell many good
                        Christian knights, with those knights of FaÃ«rie who serve God, and believe
                        in His<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7020-053"></pb> word. I, too, abide among them,
                        because my life on earth was spent in faith and purity, and in the quest of
                        the Sangreal.â</p>
                    <p>âWho then art thou, my preserver?â</p>
                    <p>The youth put aside his shining helmet, looking upward a holy yet humble joy.</p>
                    <p>âI am Galahad, the only one of King Arthur's knights to whom God gave
                        strength and patience to find the holy Greal.â</p>
                    <p>As he spoke, the boat touched the strand. He signed me with the cross once
                        more, leaped on the shore, and disappeared.</p>
                    <p>âOh, leave me not!â I cried. âGood knight and true, I need thy guidance even
                        here! How shall I tread alone the unknown isle; how enter the shining
                        palace?â</p>
                    <p>And I looked tremblingly at the castle where dwelt King Arthur and Morgue la
                        Faye; I knew it was so; for now all my prescience came back upon me, even as
                        in the Island of Ulysses. But while I gazed, not daring to approach the
                        presence of so great a hero, that which I had deemed a king's palace became
                        a temple of the King of Kings. From the cathedral windows gleamed the altar
                        lights, which I knew were burning round the Sangreal; and through the
                        wide-opened doors came the holy matin-hymn, lifted ere yet the sky was
                        purple with dawn. â<hi>Dilexi quoniam</hi>â began the psalm; and as it
                        proceeded, verse after verse pealed on my heart and memory.</p>
                    <p>â<hi>The sorrows of death compassed me, the pains of<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7020-054"></pb> hell gat hold upon me..... Then called I upon
                            the name of the Lord.....</hi></p>
                    <p>â<hi>Thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my
                            feet from falling.</hi></p>
                    <p>â<hi>I will walk before the Lord in the light of the living</hi>.â</p>
                    <p>I entered the open temple-gate, and paid my vows at the threshold of the King
                        of Heaven.</p>
                    <p>From thence I passed amid the train of worshippersâmen and women, Christian
                        knights, and ladies pure and fairâto the presence of Arthur and Morgue la
                        Faye. They sat together on a throne, alike, and yet unlike; for she was the
                        most beauteous dame in the whole land of FaÃ«rie, while on the face of her
                        mortal brother lingered still the traces of his long warfare on earth. Yet
                        he was a noble king to behold; and as he sat leaning upon Excalibur, his
                        fair hair falling on either side his broad forehead, and his limbs showing
                        grand and giantlike through his garments' folds, I felt rising within me the
                        same ardour which had impelled so many brave knights to fight, bleed, or
                        die, for Arthur of Britain.</p>
                    <p>Around the presence-chamber were grouped the most noted of the dwellers in
                        Avillion. I beheld and knew them all. Side by side stood the two bold
                        adventurers from the land of the Cymiri, who sailed westward in search of
                        the <name>Gwerdonnan Lian</name>âthe Green Isles of the Oceanâand returned
                        no more; Prince Madoc, and Merlin, the mightiest sage of those early days.
                        Afar from these, half hid in a delicious<pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7020-055"></pb>
                        twilight shadow, Sir Launfal, the pure and faithful knight, lay resting at
                        the feet of the beloved Tryamour. Near the throne leaned Ogier le Danois,
                        the valiant and pious, who at his birth was chosen by Morgue la Faye to be
                        her <foreign xml:lang="fre">loyal amoureux</foreign>. He ever kept at her
                        side, looking up into her calm, queen-like eyes, and ready to obey her
                        lightest behest, as true knight should for the sake of his dear ladye. But
                        apart from all, kneeling in a little oratory, I saw Sir Galahad. His face
                        was turned eastward, and the early sunbeams fell around his head like a
                        glory. It seemed like the smile of God's love resting first and nearest upon
                        him who on earth had loved God only.</p>
                    <p>Concealed behind the massive pillars which sustained the hall, I beheld all
                        these, and then felt, piercing even to my hiding-place, the eagle glance of
                        Arthur the king.</p>
                    <p>âCome forth!â he said. âWhence art thou?â</p>
                    <p>I answered trembling; for his voice was loud and deep, as the noise of many
                        waters; and yet it sounded familiar, for the accents, though stronger and
                        more rugged, were those of my native speech. The long-forgotten world, with
                        all its memories, all its ties, rushed back upon my thought.</p>
                    <p>âGreat king, I come from thine own far-off island in the northern seas.
                        There, Arthur of Britain is remembered still.â</p>
                    <p>His countenance changed, and his mailed fingers tightened over Excalibur.</p>
                    <p>âIs it so? Bringest thou tidings from my <choice>
                            <orig>king-</orig>
                            <reg>kingdom</reg>
                        </choice><pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7020-056"></pb> dom? Do the men of Carlyon ask
                        for Arthur to return once more?â</p>
                    <p>And his frame, hitherto calm as a giant image of a marble knight, was stirred
                        with human emotion. This land, then, was not like that of Ulysses, an
                        elysium of undesiring repose.</p>
                    <p>âI cannot answer thee, O King!â I cried, while a confused mass of earthly
                        memories struggled dimly in my brain.</p>
                    <p>But Morgue la Faye arose, and struck her wand on the area below the throne.
                        Immediately the ground divided, and formed a deep crystal well.</p>
                    <p>âLook down, and tell what thou seest,â said the sweet tones of the Queen of
                        FaÃ«rie.</p>
                    <p>âI see a land where men run about like ants, each laden with a golden
                        burthen, or struggling to gain the same; I see palaces built for and
                        inhabited by fools, and squalid huts where great and wise men grovel in
                        misery.â</p>
                    <p>âOh, my Britain! oh, my country!â groaned the king. âThe time is not yet
                        come; they look not for Arthur!â</p>
                    <p>But his immortal sister said tenderly, âWait! The ages that pass by but
                        nearer bring the Joyful day, when Arthur shall come on earth again. Child of
                        man, look into the spring once more!â</p>
                    <p>âAye, look!â cried the king. âTell me of my palace, the many-towered Camelot;
                        of Tintagel, fair home of my mother Igrayne; of the plain near the sea,
                        where my brave army fought with Mordred;<pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7020-057"></pb> of
                        the valley, where I lay wounded and tended by Sir Bedivere!â</p>
                    <p>âI see a castle on a cliff.â</p>
                    <p>âAh!â eagerly interposed the king of knights, âit is my ancient castle of
                        Dovor, where Sir Gawaine's ashes lie. Do they still say the masses for his
                        soul, and does the passing bell ring nightly over the desolate sea shore?â</p>
                    <p>âIt is a shore, not desolate but thronged with human habitations. The sea is
                        black with ships, the hum of commerce rises up to the castle-wall. Men and
                        women, their souls and bodies alike enfeebled by luxury and thirst of gold,
                        tread mincingly over the bones of the stalwart-limbed and noble-hearted
                        knight.â</p>
                    <p>âAlas! alas!â Arthur again began, but the FaÃ«rie lady's hand was on his lips.</p>
                    <p>My vision continued. âI behold a plain, intersected far and near with iron
                        net-work; over it speed, thundering and bowling, breathing smoke and flame,
                        giant-steeds stranger than those which Merlin harnessed to his chariot. He
                        chained demons within the centre of the earth; this generation has created
                        subject-demons from the dull dead metals that lie enwombed there.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd these mighty dwellers in Britain have forgotten their fathers. Of Arthur
                        and his bold knights no trace or memory remains on earth,â said the King,
                        while a shadow gloomed on his brow, like a cloud sweeping over a gray
                        mountain-top.</p>
                    <p>âNot so,â I answered. âThe world's truths of<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7020-058"></pb>
                        mystical allegory are enduring as itself. The Round Table has crumbled into
                        dust, and the raven hoots where stood the towers of Tintagel; but still many
                        an old romaunt, and many a new poet's songs, keep up the name and the glory
                        of Arthur.â</p>
                    <p>The king folded his hands upon Excalibur, and leaned his forehead against the
                        hilt. âThen I have lived,â he said, and peace again stole over his majestic
                        countenance.</p>
                    <p>Turning from the scene around me, I again sought the depths of the magic
                        well. My vision obeyed now, not the command of Arthur, but the impulse of my
                        own being. I saw no land, but a black heaving sea, upon which rode a single
                        ship. Within its darkest cabin I beheld a woman sitting alone. She rocked
                        herself to and fro in her desolation; she lifted helplessly her pale,
                        sorrowful face.</p>
                    <p>Then I leaped up with a great cry, and from my now conscious heart burst
                        forth the name of <emph>Lilias</emph>.</p>
                    <p>But immediately Morgue la Faye bound round my temples a slender circlet of
                        gold. As it touched my brow all memory vanished, and I fell down in a
                    swoon.</p>

                <div type="chapter">
                    <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="b">WHEN</hi> I awoke, or seemed to awake, the presence-chamber, and
                        all the beautiful and noble forms with which it was thronged, had
                        disappeared. I lay in a dim<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7020-059"></pb> cavern that was
                        hollowed out of a basaltic rock. Huge pillars sustained the roof; glistening
                        stalactites peopled the place with fantastic images of natural objects,
                        animals, and even the human form. These icy phantasms of life grinned from
                        dim hiding-places, making the solitude horrible. It was as though a troop of
                        spectres had suddenly been congealed into material form; each grotesque or
                        ghastly shape still transparent as air, but fixed in an awful immobility.</p>
                    <p>As I beheld, it seemed that the most fearful vision that ever startled human
                        eye, would be less terrible than these embodied phantoms. I strove to break
                        the spell. I called aloud, but the echoes of my own voice rang through the
                        cavern like the shrieks of innumerable spirits. Then I felt the thin golden
                        thread on my brow, and remembered all that had chanced since I clung to the
                        saving hand of Sir Galahad, within sight of the island-shore. And while I
                        pondered, it seemed as though my nature had become like that of the other
                        dwellers in Avillion, and I had entered on a new sphere of being. In this
                        sphere, my memory, alive to the past of others, was utterly dead to my own.
                        From the golden thread a balmy influence passed into my brain, stilling all
                        those pangs which in the human world so often teach us that to suffer needs
                        but <emph>to remember</emph>.</p>
                    <p>My life seemed only to have begun from the moment when my feet touched the
                        shore of Avillion. But from that time it was a full, real life, acute to
                        enjoy, and as acute to endure. Kneeling on the floor of the cavern, the
                        terror that convulsed me plainly showed that I was<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7020-060"></pb> human still. And like the cry which weak humanity
                        sends up to heaven, was that which, bursting from my shrinking soul, became
                        a prayer to God.</p>
                    <p>âO Thou, who tookest me out of the deep waters, save me from this hell!â</p>
                    <p>I lifted up mine eyes, and saw standing beside one of the gigantic pillars, a
                        form of flesh and blood. I knew it wellâthe dark, sombre face, in whose
                        upper lineaments was stamped the impress of intellect and beauty, equally
                        divine, while the lower features denoted stormy human passionsâambition,
                        sensuality, and obstinate willâa mixture of the angel and the beast. It was
                        Merlin the demon-born.</p>
                    <p>Still, to behold living and breathing man was bliss unutterable in this
                        horrible place. I leaped forward and clasped the knees of the enchanter. He
                        looked down upon me with contemptuous triumph.</p>
                    <p>âWeak child of the after ages, how thou quailest with fear at these poor
                        shadows! With all the boasted glories of thy modern time, the magician of
                        the elder world is greater than thou.â</p>
                    <p>At this scornful speech, I arose, trembling still, but striving to answer him
                        boldly. âMerlin, why comest thou to mock me, after affrighting me with thy
                        horrible phantasms? What sent thee thither?â</p>
                    <p>âThe merciful tenderness of Morgue la Faye, and mine own will. I desired to
                        see if one of the vaunted later world was bolder than the greatest magician
                        of ancient time. I am content: now let there be peace between us.â He
                        reached his hand; but I<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7020-061"></pb> paused, irresolute.
                        âThou fearest to clasp the hand of Merlin, the demon-born!â</p>
                    <p>He had spoken aloud the words in my heart. I dared not deny them.</p>
                    <p>âFool! I <emph>am</emph> the son of a demonâof a spirit great, strongâand
                        good, because he <emph>was</emph> strong. What is virtue, but that power
                        which is the mightiest? Therefore my demon sire was as worthy of worship as
                        any of your angels.â</p>
                    <p>I shrank aghast, and instinctively made the sign which was used as a symbol
                        in those olden times to whose simplicity I had apparently returnedâthe sign
                        of the holy cross. The magician made it likewise.</p>
                    <p>âFear not,â he said: âI, too, worship God. I, with men and spirits, must
                        needs revere the one Omnipotent Spirit, the origin of all.â</p>
                    <p>As he spoke I regarded him with less of dread; for upon his dark face had
                        dawned something which made it like unto an angel's. Such a light might have
                        irradiated the brow of the great Hierarch of heaven, before he rebelled and
                        fell.</p>
                    <p>âMerlin, I fear thee not, nor hate thee: God made us allâmen, angels, and
                        demons (or, as thou callest them, spirits). We are alike His children, or
                        may become such, one day. Give me thy hand, and guide me from this dreary
                        cave once more into the fair valley of Avillion, if indeed I am still near
                        there.â</p>
                    <p>âThis is Avillion. Thou art in the island of the blest,â said the magician.</p>
                    <pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7020-062"></pb>
                    <p>I marvelled greatly. âHow can it be so, when I suffer trial, and terror, and
                        pain? Dost thou call this happiness?â</p>
                    <p>Then Merlin answered, taking up his parable, like the prophets of olden
                        time:â</p>
                    <p>âCan the day exist without the night, or the sunshine without the shade? Does
                        not good itself need the opposition of evil? Far higher than a dull life of
                        perpetual selfish bliss, is that state of being which consists of temptation
                        and triumph, struggle and victory, endurance and repose. Thus, in our life
                        here, is intermixed just so much of evil and of suffering as will purify and
                        lift us one stage nearer to divine perfection.â</p>
                    <p>âThen all suffer, and are tempted, and must be?â</p>
                    <p>âThou scarce knowest which thy words imply,â replied Merlin; and now his
                        speech was soft, almost heavenly, so that I loved to listen to him. âHere,
                        as on earth, temptation comes from man, suffering from God. One is a
                        torturing flame, the other a refining fire. In Avillion, some have to
                        struggle against the evil within themselves: some are ordained to suffer
                        for, with, or from their brethren.â</p>
                    <p>âWhich, Merlin, is thy destiny?â</p>
                    <p>âIt comes upon me now!â cried the enchanter, while the heavenly influence
                        passed from his face, and it kindled with lurid fire. He gnashed his teeth,
                        and his glaring eyes were fixed upon a dim alcove, where stood among the
                        stalactite images one that was likest to humanity.</p>
                    <pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7020-063"></pb>
                    <p>Horror! while we beheldâfor my gaze was rivetted tooâthere was a change in
                        the icy phantom. The indistinct thing took form like a statue; the statue
                        seemed transforming into flesh; roundness and colour came into the
                        transparent limbs; the rigid hair stirred with life. Momently the icy shape
                        was becoming a beautiful woman.</p>
                    <p>Merlin looked, and his face was like one struggling with the death-agony.</p>
                    <p>âVivienne! for whom I burned in such mad passion, art thou following me
                        still? Look!â and he clutched my hand. âDost thou not see her, with her
                        bare, white-gleaming limbs; her floating, perfumed tresses, in every golden
                        thread of which she netted my soul? Dost thou not feel her young breath,
                        that once came upon my already wrinkled brow like the breath of spring?
                        Vivienneâmy love, my beautiful: it is sheâit is she!â</p>
                    <p>He drew a long gasping sigh, and stretched out his arms with a gesture of
                        incontrollable passion. But still his feet were steadfast: he approached no
                        nearer to the alluring phantasm, which appeared continually changing from
                        crystal to flesh, and then back again into crystal. Merlin's gleaming eyes
                        drank in athirst every varying line of the lovely form.</p>
                    <p>âSee!â he cried, âher brow unbends, she will smile soon; she who was so
                        harsh, so cold! Her ripe lips part sunnily; she leans forward, her lithe
                        form drooping like an aspen. VivienneâVivienne, come!â</p>
                    <p>But that instant, the cry of delirious joy became a<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7020-064"></pb> shriek of horror. He pressed his hands upon his
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>âTemptress! fiend! nay, I mingle all foul names in one, and call thee
                            <emph>woman</emph>. Begone!â</p>
                    <p>He clung to the basalt pillar against which he had leaned. His face was
                        hidden, but I saw that in the stalwart arm every muscle and nerve was
                        quivering.</p>
                    <p>âStill there? Is not the struggle ended yet? Be thyself, Merlin! Remember the
                        time on earth: thy mad passion that counted a life's wisdom as nothing to
                        one heartless woman's love. Think of the long wanderings after her fair,
                        cursed footstepsâcheated, befooled, mockedâthink of her treachery at last.
                        Ah, Vivienne, smilest thou still? So didst thou, luring me to enter the
                        magic caveâso rung thy light laugh: I heard it as the spellâclosed rock shut
                        down upon me, writhing in a darkness that might have been eternal.
                        Murderess, I defy thee! Thy tortured slave is thy victor now!â</p>
                    <p>He sprang away, and disappeared in the gloom. Immediately the woman's form
                        became congealed once more into its semi-transparent substance. There was a
                        sound like the roar of many floods, and the whole scene melted away.</p>
                    <p>I found myself on the margin of a lake, surrounded with mountains. Silvery
                        mists hung over the water, and trembled on the hill sides:âall things looked
                        pale, shadowy, and pure. At first, I seemed to be in a deep solitude; but
                        presently I became aware of a boat gliding over the lake. There, reclining
                        on a golden bed, even<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7020-065"></pb> as that wherein he
                        traversed the sea to the city of Sarras, I saw the form of him who alone was
                        pure enough to behold the Sangrealâthe virgin-knight, Sir Galahad.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="b">AS</hi> Sir Galahad neared the shore I saluted him with a
                        reverent and joyful heart. In him seemed perpetually to abide the spirit of
                        holiness, and that love of God which is the fountain from whence diverse
                        wide streams of universal love. He was at once Galahad the Christian
                        champion, before whose righteous arm fell alike the world's temptations and
                        its opposing powersâGalahad, the pious knight who saw appear the goblet
                        which held the Holy Greal, in the mystic covering of white samiteâGalahad
                        the youth, at once loving and pure; devoted to heaven, yet not free from
                        human tiesâwitness his friends, Sir Bors and Sir Percival, and the holy
                        self-devoted maid, Sir Percival's sisterâGalahad, the tender son, who dying
                        âkissed Sir Bors and Sir Percival, saying, âSalute my father, Sir Launcelot,
                        and bid him remember this unstable world,ââ and then was borne upward by
                        angels.</p>
                    <p>All these things, as I had read of them in old romaunt and history, returned
                        vividly to my memory. I said unto himâ</p>
                    <p>âO Galahad, knight beloved of God and man, is<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7020-066"></pb> this indeed the form whose breath parted while yet in prayer before the
                        holy table, in the sacred city of Sarras? Did the angel-hands then bear
                        thee, not at once to heaven, but to this happy Island of Avillion?â</p>
                    <p>He smiled serenely, and answeredâ</p>
                    <p>âYea! It was God's will that I should still serve him in the flesh, and so I
                        dwell in Avillion, among those who have journeyed thither, like Arthur,
                        without seeing death.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd is thine, like theirs, an existence whose bliss consists in trial
                        conquered?â I asked, remembering, Merlin and the horrible cave.</p>
                    <p>A faint shade of sadness overspread the beautiful face:â</p>
                    <p>âNot for myself I suffer, but for my brethren. I minister here as angels do
                        on earth. They weep over human sin and sorrow; but their tears are holy, and
                        soon driedâthey know that the All-wise and All-merciful cannot but make all
                        clear at last.â</p>
                    <p>âBut, save thee, the dwellers in Avillion have each this mournful doom of
                        trial?â</p>
                    <p>âCall it not <emph>doom</emph>,â he answered gently, âsince it is God's will,
                        and therefore must be good.âNow, of all whom thou hast seen here, whose
                        inner struggle wouldst thou behold? Desire, and the desire will be
                        fulfilledâit is ever so in the Happy Isle of Avillion.<choice>

                        </choice></p>
                    <p>âI would see Arthur,â I said.</p>
                    <p>The young knight lifted me by the hands, and instantly, with the speed of a
                        winged thought, we stood<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7020-067"></pb> unseen by the
                        couch of the son of Uther Pendragon.</p>
                    <p>The King, seemed to strive with troubled dreams. His huge limbs tossed
                        restlessly, and his sleeping fingers ever sought blindly the renowned
                        Excalibur, which lay beside himâat once his sceptre and his sword. He called
                        oftentimes upon his good knights of the Round TableâTristram, and Launcelot;
                        also, Gawaine, his near kinsman, so well beloved, and by Sir Launcelot's
                        fatal hand slain. Then, suddenly awaking, he lifted up his voice and criedâ</p>
                    <p>âO valiant companions of old! O dear land of Britain! when will Arthur
                        revisit ye once more? Why must this yearning never be allayed?âeven in the
                        happy vale of Avillion it brings perpetual pangs!â</p>
                    <p>And he smote upon his manly breast, that was long since healed of the
                        âgrievous wound,â but rent with an inward struggle, harder perhaps to bear.</p>
                    <p>Galahad came and stood beside him. I wist not whether Arthur beheld the
                        vision; but his countenance softened into peaceâeven as that of a sleeper
                        when an unseen angel passes by. He took Excalibur once more, but used it
                        neither as a sceptre nor a sword. Lifting up the hilt, which was made in the
                        form of a cross, he kissed it with devotion.</p>
                    <p>âO Thou, for whose blood in the Sangreal my good knights spent so many years
                        in a patient quest, give me patience too, that I may wait until Arthur be
                        worthy of his kingdom, and his kingdom of him! Quell this impure earthly
                        ambition, both in memory<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7020-068"></pb> and in desireâlet
                        me grow meek, and pray, until the time comes when the son of Uther shall
                        reign again in Britain.â</p>
                    <p>He kissed once more the battle-cross formed by the elfin sword, and then lay
                        down and slept like a little child.</p>
                    <p>As Galahad passed out, the whole chamber was lightened by the holy gladness
                        of his smile. Truly it might be seen that he had been among the angels; that
                        in the eyes which had beheld the shining of the Sangreal dwelt the
                        reflection of its brightness evermore.</p>
                    <p>I followed after, traversing with him the blessed isle. For it was blessed,
                        even though it was not a region of unmixed joy, or perfect repose. Each
                        human soul was pressing onward, and on each brow was the divine light of
                        Hope. They drew strength even from the trials enduredâas he who pushes
                        forward in a race feels his cheek fanned by the fresh breeze into health and
                        beauty, while the listless lingerer on perfumed banks droops wearily,
                        howsoever the sun may shine.</p>
                    <p>âBut,â I said to Sir Galahad, âwhen the trial is over rest comes? I would
                        fain see this rest.â</p>
                    <p>He took nte to a bower where reclined two lovers in the cool of dayâ</p>
                    <p>âEnter, brother!â said Galahad, âmy ministry is needless here.â</p>
                    <p>So I passed, alone and still invisible, to the presence of Sir Launfal and
                        Tryamour.</p>
                    <p>As grief grows keener from the memory of joy, go happiness is deepened by the
                        remembrance of vanished<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7020-069"></pb> sorrow. I felt this
                        when I beheld Launfal and his beloved. He talked with her of the troublous
                        time on earth; but he spoke even of suffering with a smile.</p>
                    <p>âDost remember, love, the Forest of Carlyon: how I lay in poverty,
                        despondency, and painâwhen the three FaÃ«rie maids came riding by, and
                        brought me unto a region of peace and beauty, even to thee? O dear eyes,
                        that looked upon me in my darkness and my misery, and loved me amidst all!â</p>
                    <p>And, as he lay at her feet, he drew down to his own the lovely head, and
                        kissed the drooping eyesâradiant as those of a princess of FaÃ«rie; but
                        tender as those of a loving woman.</p>
                    <p>Then again spoke Launfal:â</p>
                    <p>âHow hard it was, after that season of bliss, to mix once more with the
                        vileness of earthâhow bitter, save for those hours when a wish brought me
                        the dear presence of my FaÃ«rie love. Then, when for that pure smile I had to
                        endure the false queen Guinever'sâmore cursed in her love than in her hateââ</p>
                    <p>âO my faithful one! yet thou didst remember me!â And as Tryamour bent over
                        him, her long locks, dropping immortal balm, fell in golden waves on the
                        bosom of her knight and love.</p>
                    <p>âI remembered thee? Could I forget my life, my other soul? Yet in the dungeon
                        and at the stake did I endure, nor implored thee to come and save me: I
                        never asked of thee aughtânot even loveâyet thou gavest me all!â</p>
                    <pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7020-070"></pb>
                    <p>She smiled upon him with her heavenly eyes, and bade him remember earth's
                        sorrows no more.</p>
                    <p>âNay, it is sweet to remember,â answered Launfal. âHere, in this dear bower,
                        let me think of the lonely dungeon where I lay in perpetual darkness,
                        knowing that the first entering gleam of daylight would be a signal to guide
                        me unto death. Let me call back the moment when dazzled, blinded, I
                        staggered forth at last. By degrees, all grew clear: I heard the leafy
                        rustling of the great pile formed of yet green treesâah! cruel lengthening
                        of torture, planned by that revengeful woman-fiend! I saw her sitting on the
                        pollated throne, beside her deluded spouse, my dear lord King Arthur! He
                        loved me onceâeven now he blenched at the sight of me, and turned away his
                        troubled face; perchance, he could not yet believe that I had so wronged his
                        honour. Then came the chains, the lighted torch, the approaching flameââ</p>
                    <p>âSpeak no more!â shuddering said the FaÃ«rie ladyâwith the woman's heart.</p>
                    <p>âYet a little; but only of theeâof thee, Tryamour!âas the steps of thy fair
                        palfrey sounded musically along the palace terrace, and thou stoodest forth
                        with thy immortal beauty to proclaim the honour of thy true knight. Oh! the
                        rapture, when I felt the cool breeze wrapping my freed limbs as with a
                        garment, and the swift steed bore me on, ever following thee, past the gleam
                        of the now harmless pyre, past the shoutings of the multitude, far, far over
                        forest, mountain, and sea, into the happy vale of Avillion.â</p>
                    <pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7020-071"></pb>
                    <p>He looked up; first heavenwards, and then into that earthly heaven, the eyes
                        of her he loved. As I beheld him, it seemed that his face, sublimed by past
                        suffering, was more beautiful even than hers, which bore the cloudless
                        aspect of perpetual bliss. I saw how it was that, in some things, <emph>a
                            man</emph> is greater than an angel.</p>
                    <p>As these two sat together, leaning cheek to cheek in the silence of perfect
                        love, the birds in the linden-trees over-head broke forth into singing; and
                        lo! amidst the marvels of the Happy Isle, I distinguished one moreâthat
                        their very song was speech. Thus it ran:â</p>
                    <p>âBut for the rain, the green earth would wither; without the evening gloom,
                        man could not behold the stars. So, storm bringeth freshness; night, dawn,
                        trial, peace; and death, immortality!â</p>
                    <p>I fell on my face, prayingânay, almost weeping, as one sometimes does in a
                        heart-poured prayer such as was mine. When it ended, I arose; but the
                        marriage-bower, and those happy ones who abode therein, I saw no more.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">I STOOD</hi> once more beside the lake amidst the hills. It was
                        still veiled in that perpetual mist; and the solitary marge was dimly
                        illumined by a light like that of a gray June midnight, when the pale
                        half-moon has<pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7020-072"></pb> just set. There was no sound,
                        not even of a stirring leaf; for the hills sloped down to the water-side,
                        bare and treeless; lake, mountain, and skyâsky, lake, and mountainâreflected
                        each other in ghost-like silence and repose.</p>
                    <p>At length, through the mist, I heard a sound of many footsteps. They came
                        nearer; and I distinguished the form of Merlin, leading a mounted band of
                        the dwellers in Avillion. Suddenly he paused, and the loud trumpet-tone of
                        his voice rang over the still shore:â</p>
                    <p>âWho will go with me across the Lake of Shadows?â</p>
                    <p>There stepped forward the giant figure of King ArthurâMorgue la Faye
                        following. Behind them Sir Galahad stood, meek, yet fearless; and these
                        three alone answered Merlin's summons. But the King paused, and said,â</p>
                    <p>âHow shall we cross the awful lake? Galahad, thou only among us who has known
                        death, aid us now.â</p>
                    <p>The young knight advanced to the margin, and stretched his arms out over the
                        water that lay before him, solemn, soundless, unrippled by a single wave.
                        Then I saw glide towards him the boat in which he had formerly reclined,
                        with its purple sails shadowing the golden bed. It came on, impelled
                        invisibly; for there was no man therein.</p>
                    <p>âEnter!â said Galahad, in his angel-voice; and immediately the vessel rocked
                        beneath the great bulk of<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7020-073"></pb> the two mightiest
                        of Britain's ancient sons, Arthur and Merlin. âEnter thou, too, my brother,â
                        said they to me.</p>
                    <p>So I entered tremblingly, yet eagerly, after Morgue la Faye. Then Merlin
                        uttered a spell, and the boat darted forward from the strand without either
                        wind or tide.</p>
                    <p>Far out into the lake we sailed. The silvery vapours shut out from my vision
                        alike shore and sky. I cast my eyes downwards; and lo! it seemed that, like
                        a bird of the air sweeping over a city of earth, the boat glided over a new
                        world lying beneath the waters. In its mysterious depths, I saw palaces,
                        towers, tombs, outlined dimly through a gigantic shroud of mist, like that
                        which hung above the surface. At times, stirring amidst this shroud, I
                        distinguished denser vapours, which scarce bore airy form, but resembled the
                            <foreign xml:lang="lat">cirri</foreign> that float in a summer evening
                        sky.</p>
                    <p>Merlin arose. As the masses of his black robe fell heavily around him, he
                        might have been likened to a thunder-cloud lifting itself slowly from the
                        horizon. He wore no magic symbols; he held no books of power. In the
                        strength of his soul alone lay the necromancer's might.</p>
                    <p>âYe who desired to visit the Lake of Shadowsâsay, who among you seeks to call
                        up the ghastly habitants of the City of the Dead?â</p>
                    <p>King Arthur spoke first:â</p>
                    <p>âI yearn for tidings of my kingdom on the earth. Therefore I would fain
                        summon those who lie buried in<pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7020-074"></pb> Britain, and
                        whose spirits may still hover round the spot where their bones repose. Which
                        among them, deemest thou, is most able to answer my summons?â</p>
                    <p>âLove only has power over death,â replied the enchanter. âCall one of those
                        who were dearest to thee on earth.â</p>
                    <p>âThey were few indeed!â And a grim, almost scornful smile swept over Arthur's
                        face. âAmbition was all to me. I loved my royal kingdom more than any of its
                        subject dwellersâsave, perhaps, Guinever and Gawaine.â</p>
                    <p>âChoose between them!â said Merlin's stern voice.</p>
                    <p>The monarch paused, irresolute.</p>
                    <p>âGawaine, thou wert a valiant knight; indeed I loved thee, my sister's son!
                        But Guinever sat with me on that dear-prized throne. I summon her, not as
                        the wife of Arthur, but the Queen of Britain.â</p>
                    <p>Morgue la Faye's hand dropped from her brother's, and Merlin's dark brow was
                        knitted in wrath. Nevertheless he leaned over the vessel's side, dipped his
                        fingers in the lake, and uttered the spell:â</p>
                    <p>âSoul of Guinever Queen of Britain, arise!â</p>
                    <p>Slowly lifting itself out of the deep appeared one of the cloud-like vapours.
                        Gradually it became a human form, wearing a nun's garb. Then I remembered
                        the story of the death of her whose spirit parted ere Sir Launcelot came to
                        Almesbury, over whom â<hi>he wept not greatly, but sighed</hi>.â Perchance
                        that one long <choice>
                            <orig>tear-</orig>
                            <reg>tearless</reg>
                        </choice><pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7020-075"></pb> less sigh followed the frail
                        Guinever's fleeting soul even to its resting-place; for in the wail that
                        arose from the waters, I heard evermore the wordsâ</p>
                    <p>âLauncelot! Launcelot!â</p>
                    <p>âPeace, complaining spirit! False queen, false wife, false woman, answer thy
                        lord!â cried the enchanter.</p>
                    <p>Arthur spokeâstern, cold, passionless. He thought neither of pity, anger, nor
                        revengeâonly of his Britain. But to all his questions came from the
                        suffering soul no word, save the cry of âMercy, mercy! I repent! Let me
                        rest!â And ever and anon, in mournful plainings, was repeated the wail,
                        âLauncelot! Launcelot!â</p>
                    <p>The king sat down wrathful and silent; and the phantom faded into a wreath of
                        mist that seemed continually to hover round the vessel.</p>
                    <p>Then Sir Galahad arose, and stood before Arthur and Merlin, meek reproach,
                        mingled with sorrow, clouding his eyes.</p>
                    <p>âOh, men!â he said: âsinful yourselves, yet so harsh to judge the sinningâis
                        there no pity in God's dear heaven for such as these? The convent-cell at
                        Almesbury yet bears record of the tears, the sackcloth, the bloody
                        scourgeâsad portion of her who was once a queen! The aisles of Glastonbury
                        yet ring with those funeral orisons wrung from the penitent despair of the
                        knighted monk!â</p>
                    <p>And turning from where Arthur and Merlin sat togetherâboth shrinking into
                        silence before his words<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7020-076"></pb> âGalahad dipped
                        his hands in the lake, writing in the stirless waters the sign of the holy
                        cross.</p>
                    <p>âOh, dear father, my lord Sir Launcelot, whose sins may God pardon! no voice
                        but mine shall summon thee here. Let me look on thy face once more!â</p>
                    <p>There was a pause; and then rising from the misty depth, I saw the mailed
                        image of a knight. It was Guinever's loverâfaithful in sin, but yet most
                        faithfulâthe bravest of the champions of the Round TableâSir Launcelot du
                        Lac. Beneath the shadowy helmet were the featuresâstill, and ashen grayâas
                        they might have appeared to his brother monks who gazed down weepingly into
                        the deep grave at Joyous Garde.</p>
                    <p>He spoke not, and none spoke with him. Only his son Galahad, with clasped
                        hands, knelt and prayed.</p>
                    <p>Even while the spirit lingered, there came and hovered over his helm a
                        cloud-like shadow; and through the silence was heard that continual
                        wailââLauncelot, Launcelot!â But it won no answer, either in word or look,
                        from the pale spectre of Guinever's knight.</p>
                    <p>The phantoms both grew dimmer; and then I was aware of another sight coming
                        near the vessel. It seemed an open boat; and therein, resting on a bed, was
                        a woman dressed in fair array; and â<hi>she lay as though she had
                        smiled</hi>.â By this, and by the writing in her hand, I knew the vision was
                        she who had died for love of Sir LauncelotâElaine, the fair maid of Astolat.
                        I looked on the beautiful dead image, and thought of the time when the
                        waters of Thames had<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7020-077"></pb> floated up to the feet
                        of Sir Launcelot this poor broken lily, that asked no guerdon for love
                        faithful even unto death, but burial from his hand. And when I remembered
                        this, my heart melted with pity, and I wept.</p>
                    <p>âDost thou weep for me?â said a voice, sweet in its sadness, like a
                        vesper-bell heard over the sea at night. I felt it came from the pale lips
                        that looked â<hi>as if they smiled</hi>.â Weepest thou for me, because I
                        died? Nay: for love's bliss was greater than death's pain.â</p>
                    <p>âHow soâwhen the love proved vain?â I asked.</p>
                    <p>She did not answer my words; but went on murmuring softly, as one does in
                        musing aloud:â</p>
                    <p>âDear my lord Sir Launcelot! was it sin or shame that I should love thee, who
                        came and stood before me like an angel in a dream? I never thought tenderly
                        of living man, save thee. Thou wert the sun that unfolded my life's flower:
                        when the sun set, it faded, and I died.â</p>
                    <p>The voice was thrilled with a meek sorrow that roused my pity into wrath.</p>
                    <p>âSurely it was evil in the sun to scorch the poor flower,â I cried,
                        remembering how the concealed knight took and wore in the fray the token of
                        Elaine la Blanche; and how, when she swooned at his wound, he, saying no
                        word of any former love, prayed her brother, Sir Lavaine, to bring her to
                        him, and took her in his arms and kissed her. Then I thought of all the days
                        of fondest tendance which to the knight brought renewed life, to the fair
                        maid death. And lastly, of the cruel<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7020-078"></pb> scorn
                        which, knowing her pure love, instead of requital offered pitiful gold. And
                        my swelling heart told me that Sir Launcelot had done a grievous wrong.</p>
                    <p>But again the voice seemed to answer my thoughts, though it spoke not to me,
                        but dreamily and vague:â</p>
                    <p>âWas it, then, so sorrowful to die for thee, my Launcelot? or did my death
                        lay aught to thy charge? Nay: it was no sin of thine. I worshipped thee, as
                        one should only worship Heaven; Heaven punished meâthen pityingly took me
                        home: I am content!â</p>
                    <p>Again my tears fell to hear that low, tender voice; and I marvelled in my
                        heart whether on earth it had been ever thus uncomplaining. The spirit
                        answered once more:â</p>
                    <p>âWhat was I, that I should murmur against thee, O my lord Sir Launcelot? Only
                        once-when I lay in my tears, and darkness, and despairâI heard the blithe
                        sound of thy trumpets, and saw thee going forth again into the fair world;
                        while Iâforgotten, forsakenâwas to thee less than the grass under thy
                        footsteps. Oh, forgive me, my lord and love, for that one cry of reproach
                        against thee! I <emph>would</emph> have beenâaye, ten thousand timesâthat
                        trodden grass, if for a moment it gave freshness to thy feet!â</p>
                    <p>I looked on the calm features, where no movement of the lips gave token of
                        the voice which spake. But the deep peace of the smile that sat on the dead
                        face was an echo of the words which the spirit uttered. And when I thought
                        of the pure soul which had departed in the tower of Astolatâpraying and
                            confessing<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7020-079"></pb> meekly unto God, and
                        remembering with tender and forgiving love Sir LauncelotâI said in my heart
                        that unto such, against whom earth's hopes are closed, does the kingdom of
                        heaven open.</p>
                    <p>While I watched this vision, Arthur, Merlin, and Sir Galahad sat at the
                        vessel's prow, each absorbed in thought; little to them was maiden's love or
                        maiden's woe. But Morgue la Faye came near with her woman's soul shining
                        tearfully in her majestic eyes, and criedâ</p>
                    <p>âTell meâthou pure and meek spirit, whom I have summoned from thy restâdoes
                        the remembered love of earth wound thee even in Paradise?â</p>
                    <p>Elaine la Blanche answered:â</p>
                    <p>âI love still, but I suffer no more: God looked on me in mercy, and drew
                        wholly unto Himself that love which in life was divided. I am happy-yet I
                        forget thee not: I never could forget thee, my lord Sir Launcelot!â</p>
                    <p>While the voice yet spoke, there stood beside the bed another spiritâalso in
                        woman's form. Before its glory the mists dispersed, and light broke forth
                        upon the waters. Soon another voice was heard, sweet as that which had
                        murmured its patient sorrow; but clear and joyous as the angels' harping
                        before the throne.</p>
                    <p>âGalahad, dear brother of my soul, say unto my brother in the flesh, Sir
                        Percivalâand to that true knight Sir Borsâthat far exceeding the holy city
                        of Sarras, to which we four journeyed together, is the<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7020-080"></pb> Eternal city, New Jerusalem. Say, I rejoice that
                        I died, a willing sacrifice, for the glory of God.â</p>
                    <p>Galahad lifted his brow, radiant with exceeding joy.</p>
                    <p>âMaidenâthrough life pure and heaven-devoted, as was the virgin-mother of
                        Nazarethâsay, where does thy soul abide?â</p>
                    <p>âIn Paradise; ministering there as many of God's servants do on earth, and as
                        thou dost in Avillion. Therefore my spirit, inter-penetrated and made strong
                        by its love of Godâwhich in life was entire and undividedâis commanded to
                        succour this soul, once tortured by earthly love. Sister, come!â</p>
                    <p>Over the bier she bent, lifting by the hand the pale form, even like Him who
                        lifted the dead, and said, âArise.â</p>
                    <p>Elaine arose. To the opening eyes came a brightness, less of earth than
                        heaven; to the lips came a voiceâno mournful complainings, but melodious
                        hallelujahs. And so, linked hand-in-hand, the sister-souls passed from
                        sight, not sinking like the rest into the dim city of the dead, but soaring
                        upwards unto the mount of God.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="b">AS</hi> one who falls, flooded and dazzled by a sunshine
                        cloudâor as Paul fell, blinded by the heavenly vision near Damascusâso sank
                        I. Human eye and ear could not endure the glorious radiance, the angelic<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7020-081"></pb> melody. Beneath them, my brain and sense
                        seemed numbedâor rather exhaled into delicious death.</p>
                    <p>From this trance I awoke, feeling on my brow the light touch of a woman's
                        hand. It brought strange, undefined remembrances. Wistfully I looked up.</p>
                    <p>I lay in the midst of the great hall, once filled with many knights and
                        ladies. It now held only the fair presence of Queen Morgue la Faye. But she
                        stood beside me less as a queen than a woman. Her gorgeous robes were thrown
                        aside, and in her white garments she seemed a simple earthly maid, even
                        resembling â I strove to remember what or who she resembled; but my thoughts
                        fled away, like winged birds, ever fluttering on before, yet impossible to
                        seize. Amidst them I heard continually the murmuring of the little fount
                        which had sprung up at Morgue la Faye's bidding from the cloven marble
                        floor. It seemed singing to me an olden song of some long-past existence;
                        and yet, when I drew nearer, its waters were as smooth and as opaque as the
                        marble which encircled them. But still, rising from their depths, came that
                        mystic murmur, as it were a voice from the inner earth.</p>
                    <p>I leaned eagerly over the well, and my greedy ear drank in its musical
                        whispers. Morgue la Faye said to meâ</p>
                    <p>âChild of man, what dost thou hear?â</p>
                    <p>âI hear a sound, like the evening wind in the full-leafed linden-trees that
                        grewâwhere was it they grew? Or like that Eolian harp we put between the
                        ivied window, and listenedâ<emph>who</emph> listened, and
                            <emph>when</emph>?<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7020-082"></pb> Alas! alas! the
                        thoughts slip from me; I cannot grasp them!â</p>
                    <p>âBend down thy head again over the water.â</p>
                    <p>âI feelâI feel a perfume; it comes from a violet-bank, the bank whereâbut no,
                        all is gone. Again, it is like a rose-garden; I am walking there in sunshine
                        and gladness; and now it changes to a sweet clematis-breathâwafted through
                        that still autumn night, with the stars shining coldly overhead, and the
                        waning crescent glimmering through the trees. Ah me! ah me! it is fled from
                        me! No more! no more!â And uttering these mournful words, the perpetual
                        dirge of life, I fell down weeping beside the mysterious spring.</p>
                    <p>Morgue la Faye stood on the other brink; for the well had grown wider and
                        broader, and even now was swelling out into an infant stream. She stood, her
                        falling hands meek-folded, her head half bent, watching me. A gleam of
                        womanly pity softened the steel-like brightness of her eyes.</p>
                    <p>Perceiving it, I cried imploringly,â</p>
                    <p>âO Queen of Avillion, I am not of thy nature, but only mortal man! Why dost
                        thou try me thus?â</p>
                    <p>âBecause, as thou sayest, thou art not of our nature,â she answered softly.
                        âThou canst not stay in our happy isle; but I have no power, nor yet desire,
                        to cast thee thence. Thou must depart of thine own will.â</p>
                    <p>âDepart!â I echoed sorrowfully; for now that the spell had ceased, I felt no
                        more the vague memories<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7020-083"></pb> and wild longings
                        which it had awakened. I thought with fear of quitting the beautiful island
                        for some unknown region, perhaps of horror and woe.</p>
                    <p>âPoor mortal!â Morgue La Faye continued. âArt thou then so loath to depart?
                        Do the sounds and sights of former times, which I have raised up before
                        thee, fail to win thee back to earth?â</p>
                    <p>âI know not of what thou speakest,â I answered, trembling. âTrue, I had a
                        vision; but it is gone now. I would fain stay in Avillion.â</p>
                    <p>âIt cannot be,â said the firm but still gentle voice of King Arthur's sister,
                        as she crossed the spring, its waters sinking not beneath her airy
                        footsteps. Then she bade me kneel, and took from my head the slender thread
                        of gold which continually encircled it.</p>
                    <p>Instantly my brain reeled beneath the thronging memories with which it
                        teemed. All came back to meâmy land, my home, my Liliasâeach thought
                        piercing my soul like arrows tipped with that bitterest poison, the
                        remembrance of eternally-lost joy.</p>
                    <p>I dashed myself on the ground at the feet of Morgue la Faye:â</p>
                    <p>âCruel queen, why didst thou take from me that blessed spell of Oblivion? Why
                        torture me with these memories of earth? O Lilias my wife! my love! my
                        beautiful! would to Heaven that I might see thy face once more!â</p>
                    <p>Morgue la Faye lifted me from the earth, where I grovelled in mad despair,
                        and led me to the brink of the magic well.</p>
                    <pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7020-084"></pb>
                    <p>âNow, poor child of mortality, cast thine eyes down once more.â</p>
                    <p>I did so. Oh marvel! As the clouds of oblivion had passed from my soul, so
                        passed the dusky shadow from beneath the water, which became crystal clear.
                        While I gazed, there grew defined from out its depths the image of a
                        sceneâan earth-landscapeâone that I knewâoh how well! Blue and dim rose the
                        mountainsâthose giant spectres of my childhood, which, night after night,
                        enclosed the descending sun in their craggy, ghostly arms; beneath them lay
                        the valley,âand the broad river, and the woody slope, where stoodâa Home.</p>
                    <p>We had chosen it as our home, our wedded home, whenâthe melancholy voyage
                        endedâLilias and I should return to our own land and our own people. There
                        it stood, near the spot where we had both dwelt from childhoodâa house
                        reverend and beautiful with years. Over its brown walls climbed the ivy,
                        mingling with the dear clematis, cherished of old; its painted gothic
                        windows transmitted every sunbeam in rainbow-tinted glory; and from its
                        protecting eaves the brooding swallows merrily flewâtheir cheerful homes
                        without being meet emblems of that most blessed one within.</p>
                    <p>A moment, and the scene changed to the interior. I saw the quaint
                        labyrinthine chambers, whose gloom was made beautiful by the presence of
                        youth and happiness. Pictures shone from the dark-panelled walls; in a
                        recess, the ivory-keyed instrument smiled over<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7020-085"></pb> the soul of music shut up within it; above the
                        green, branch-adorned hearth, fresh-gathered flowers bent to their own fair
                        images in the mirror.</p>
                    <p>And near them, pure and lovely as they, was my own life's flower, whom I had
                        chosen to adorn and bless my homeâmy wife Lilias!</p>
                    <p>She sat droopingly, her cheek resting against the crimson chairâthe same
                        where mine had rested in many an hour of mental and bodily suffering. The
                        remembrance seemed to strike her then; for suddenly she lifted her face,
                        wherein was love so intense that it almost became agony, and
                            criedâ<emph>aye, I heard the very tone</emph>â</p>
                    <p>âWilfred, beloved, come!â</p>
                    <p>I would have plunged into hell itself to answer that call! Hearing it, I
                        sprang madly into the waters, there to seek the vision and the voice.</p>
                    <p>In a moment, Avillion and its dwellers had vanished from me for ever.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="b">AWAKING</hi>, I found myself, not in the happy homeânot in the
                        dear arms of my Liliasâbut lying in the depth of a thick wood, which, though
                        in all things resembling earth, was yet unknown to me.</p>
                    <p>I had gained a strange new landâbut different from both those I had
                        mysteriously traversed; it was neither Elysium nor Avillion. It was a human
                        world. I trod<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7020-086"></pb> it with the body of a living
                        manâa man of modern time. I repeated to myself the name I bore in my
                        father's house, Wilfred Mayer. Another name, not less familiar, I murmured,
                        mingled with many tears; the name of my long-parted wifeâmy dear Lilias.
                        Every home-recollection came back to me, as to one who after a season of
                        madness is restored to health and reason. The intervening time was dim; I
                        could scarce tell whether it were vision or reality. But all seemed ended
                        now. I felt a real man, dwelling on a real earth.</p>
                    <p>I touched the moss whereon I layâthe same green carpet of which Lilias and I
                        had often heaped fairy-cushions in her childish days; when I, a sickly
                        youth, was glad to make myself a child for and with her. Thinking of this, I
                        laid my cheek on the soft moss, kissed it, and wept.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly I heard a footstep passing by. It was a strangerâhuman like myself.
                        The face was such a one as in this nineteenth century may be seen
                        sometimesânay, oftenâin street, or mart, or social dwelling; not radiant in
                        superhuman beauty, nor yet devoid of an inward spiritual charm; the face
                        neither of a god nor an angel, but of <emph>a good man</emph>. The moment I
                        saw it, I acknowledged this; stretched out my hand to him, and called him
                        âbrother.â</p>
                    <p>âYou say right,â he answered, smiling. âWe are all brothers here, and though
                        I cannot say I know your face, yet there is something in it which seems
                        familiar to me. Therefore, welcome, brother!â</p>
                    <p>âWelcome to where? for indeed I know not.â</p>
                    <pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7020-087"></pb>
                    <p>âTo quiet spot on God's earth, which its inhabitants try to make as near as
                        they can to Paradise. We call it Eden-land, or the Happy Isle.â</p>
                    <p>âAnother Happy Isle!â I cried, and again became bewildered. âOh, friend! I
                        have dreamed such wild dreams, if indeed they be dreams. Help me to clear my
                        poor wandering brain. I desire nought but quiet, and home, and Lilias.â</p>
                    <p>âLilias? I knew the name once; it was a sorrowful name to me, but its memory
                        is softened here. Come, stranger and brother, you shall speak no more, think
                        no more, until you have rested and grown calm. Follow me to my home.â</p>
                    <p>He took my hand and guided me through the wood. I noticed more closely his
                        face, his bearing, even his garments. The latter were simple and manly; such
                        as one in our century and our English clime might wear, consulting ease and
                        grace rather than fantastic fashion. We entered his dwelling, which was
                        characteristic as his dressâentered by an unlatched door. Then he began to
                        fulfil the gentle precept which I saw written over his hearth. â<hi>Feed the
                            hungry, and clothe the naked</hi>.â</p>
                    <p>In a brief time I stood beside him, already feeling like a denizen of this
                        new home and new world. Then we sat down together by that hospitable hearth,
                        and he said to meâ</p>
                    <p>âMy brotherâor rather my son, for you are a youth compared with these white
                        hairsâwill you now tell me by what name I shall call you?â</p>
                    <pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7020-088"></pb>
                    <p>âIts sound will bring back mournful remembrances,â said I. âIt is mine, and
                        my father's also,âWilfred Mayer.â</p>
                    <p>The stranger clasped my two hands in his, and then looked at me eagerly,
                        fondly, parting back my hair as though I had been a little child. âI could
                        weep now,â he said, âsave that in this happy place are no tears shed, not
                        even for earth's memories. I rejoice, and thank Heaven, that I look in the
                        face of my sister's son.â</p>
                    <p>âYou are thenââ</p>
                    <p>âAy, say the name, since it is not forgotten on earth,â and he smiled with a
                        calm pleasure; âthe name I bore when we were all little children
                            togetherâ<emph>Cyril</emph>.â</p>
                    <p>âI learned it when I was a child too,â cried I, clasping his hand once more.
                        âWell I remember how on many a stormy winter's night my mother would stand
                        by my little bed, pale and grave, and teach me in my simple prayers to say,
                        âGod preserve Uncle Cyril far over the seas.ââ</p>
                    <p>âDid she so?âmy dear Hesterâmy true sister!â murmured the old man with a
                        tremulous lip. âGo on, tell me more.â</p>
                    <p>âHe was always a mystery to me, this Uncle Cyril, whom I had never seen, and
                        of whom no one spoke, without looking sorrowful. Once, too, when there came
                        to us, with her babe in her arms, the mother of Liliasââ</p>
                    <p>âYou mistake,â cried Cyril. âThe mother of Lilias<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7020-089"></pb> died at her birth. Nay, but I forget time's
                        passing. Perhaps there was a second Lilias? Go on, Wilfred.â</p>
                    <p>âI remember that day well: how I, a blithe schoolboy, was touched by her
                        sweet, quiet face, and hearing she had come from abroad, asked her, as I did
                        all strangers, if she brought news of Uncle Cyril; how she looked very
                        mournful, and my mother took me away, telling me not to speak to her of
                        Uncle Cyril more.â</p>
                    <p>Cyril drooped his head lower on his hands, only saying softly, âGo on, my
                        sister's child, go on.â</p>
                    <p>âI remember also, though faintly, for I was still very young, how there used
                        to come letters from abroad, over which my mother looked grave, nay, wept
                        sometimes, and I knew they were from Uncle Cyril. Over the last she did not
                        weep but smiled, took me on her knee, and told me that Uncle Cyril was
                        coming home. Week after week passed, but he came not. My father sometimes
                        hinted of ships that set sail for home, and vanished strangely on the wide
                        deep, never reaching land. And day by day my mother's face grew sadder, and
                        she started at every sound. When I asked her what had become of Uncle
                        Cyril's ship, she would shudder and say that God alone knewâno living man
                        could tell.â</p>
                    <p>I paused, but he motioned me to continue.</p>
                    <p>âMonth after month went by, and a strange awe came over me. All day I
                        pondered about the missing<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7020-090"></pb> vessel, whose
                        fate no man knew. Sometimes at night I dreamed about it; I saw it on
                        fire,âor becalmed until all the crew perished by slow famine or maddening
                        thirst,âor striking on a rock, and sinking in a moment, as though some great
                        demon from the world below had sucked it in with all its living freight.
                        Every wild sea-tale that I had readâevery wilder fancy that boyhood's dreamy
                        brain could conceiveâwere gathered up to give form and shape to the story.
                        Yet still it was thereâa nameless horrorâa mystery sealed, until the great
                        day when the sea should give up her dead.â</p>
                    <p>âAmen!â said my companion, solemnly. âBut tell me still of that dear home.â</p>
                    <p>â,There, week by week, hope grew fainterâfadedâdied. At last my mother told
                        me, sadly, but without weeping, to leave out one name in my childish
                        prayersâfor that Uncle Cyril was with God, and needed them no more. But the
                        awe and expectation would not pass away; and many a night I started up in my
                        little bed, dreaming that he was come.â</p>
                    <p>I ceased, and a deep silence fell upon us both, as we sat by the red embers
                        of the sinking fireâfor the climate had changed in this new world, and I
                        felt no longer the glow of perpetual summer, but the pleasant chill of
                        autumn. I thought of the region, and of my companion, with a curiosity born
                        scarce of fear but wonder. Had Cyril indeed passed through the awful gate,
                        and did I stand in the Land of the Dead, with one of its unearthly
                        inhabitants? He might have read my thought;<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7020-091"></pb>
                        for my hand was caressed once more by his own hand of flesh and blood, as he
                        saidâ</p>
                    <p>âMy kinsman, Wilfred Mayer,âknow that God's power and mysteries, even on
                        earth, are greater than men dreamy of. Listen to the tale of one who, though
                        he has seen strange things, and been led through strange paths, yet looks,
                        like thee, to the same ending of the journeyâdeath's calm sleep, and the
                        waking unto an eternal morrow.â</p>
                    <p>He lifted his eyes to heaven: I drew near and listened to his words.</p>
                    <p>âThere was a boy once, born with every passion in his nature so vehement,
                        that a feather's touch might turn him either to good or evil. It is so
                        sometimes: Gabriel and Lucifer were both archangels, and the boldest of all
                        the apostles was he who stood consenting unto thee death of Stephen. We
                        cannot fathom these mysteries.</p>
                    <p>âWell! the boy of whom I speak had two good angels ever at his sideâhis twin
                        sister Hester, and one who was of distant kindred, though she had grown up
                        with them, eating the same bread, and drinking of the same cup. Of these two
                        the youth loved one dearly, as a brother should; the otherâGod alone knoweth
                        how he loved <emph>her</emph>! In this love were mingled esteem, reverence,
                        tenderness, passion. Every one of his heart's fibres clung around her, day
                        by day. And because they had so twinedâslowly, imperceptibly, like household
                        linksâshe never felt or saw them; but when dearer bonds came, she untwined
                        these, <choice>

                        </choice><pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7020-092"></pb> ingly, unconsciouslyâslipped from
                        them; they fellâand the boy's heart broke!</p>
                    <p>âI speak wildly: it did not break; but its softness became ironâits full,
                        rich tide was turned to gall. She lived to weep a sister's tearsâmark you,
                            <emph>only a sister's</emph>!âover an outcast and a prodigal. She never
                        knew the truth; if she hadâwhy even then it would have been the same. She
                        had done no wrongâshe never loved him.</p>
                    <p>âHe became a wanderer over the wide world. The face of God, which he had
                        mocked in the glare of cities, he learned to see revealed in the terrible
                        loneliness of the desertâin the wonders of the mighty deep. Still he
                        wandered onâGod's mercy following him. Who could hide from the presence of
                        the Eternal? In the grand mountain solitudes It came, bringing awful
                        peaceâIt soothed him in the deep river-flowâIt smiled upon him in the green,
                        sunny savannah. So, through the wide arms of Natureâthe Nature which He had
                        madeâGod drew unto himself this erring soul; and it grew pure and calm.</p>
                    <p>âAfter many years, the man yearned to see the home whence the boy had fled
                        with curses. He embarked for Englandâhis heart's desire flying swifter than
                        the vessel; but an unseen hand prevented both. Nor ship nor crew were ever
                        heard of more.â</p>
                    <p>âTell me, O strange relater of this marvellous tale, whither sped the fated
                        shipâor how?â</p>
                    <p>His voice changed, and his countenance likewise.<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7020-093"></pb> He spoke now like one, who forgetting himself,
                        had become a teacher among his brethren.</p>
                    <p>âI said before, in this world, concerning which proud man thinks he knows
                        all, there are many mysteries of which he knows nothing. Who has ever found
                        a path through the region of eternal ice? Whose daring bark has sailed over
                        the mighty Antarctic Sea?â</p>
                    <p>âIt is true! It is true! But my sense is bewildered; explain the mystery
                        further.â</p>
                    <p>He went on:â</p>
                    <p>âMen traverse the seas, year after year, safely; but then comes a tale of
                        some ship which has vanished mysteriously from the face of the deepâhow, or
                        by what means, none can ever tell. In the thronged ocean-path lay no
                        floating wreck, no glimpse of a flaming vessel, gives token how she
                        perished: men shudder, marvel,âand forget, until they hear a like tale.â</p>
                    <p>âIt is even so!â I sighed.</p>
                    <p>âNoom, listen! <emph>The vessels perish not</emph>: He to whom belong land
                        and sea, hides them in the hollow of His hand, and brings them safe to a
                        haven in the midst of the deepâan island-gardenâthe Eden whence Adam was
                        driven. It is here!â</p>
                    <p>I started in trembling wonder:â</p>
                    <p>âThis, then, is Paradise?â</p>
                    <p>âNot Paradise, such as when man needed continually the visible presence of
                        angels; but an Eden suited for earth's late-born childrenâa land where men
                        of this modern time may live in peace, and worship God.â</p>
                    <pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7020-094"></pb>
                    <p>He rose up, for while we talked night had fallen:â</p>
                    <p>âNow, my sonâare you not even as my son?âgo! Rest and sleep. To-morrow I will
                        show the wonders of this land.â</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="b">I LAID</hi> me down, and slept the deep sleep of healthful
                        weariness. At dawn I awoke;âthere was, then, night and day, sunrise and
                        sunset, in this Eden-land? The golden darts fell on my eyelids, and slumber
                        passed away. My mind was clear: I remembered all the past, even its
                        sufferings; but suffering itself was calm. I waited meekly for the strange
                        mysteries of my fate to work themselves out: they were a mingled and knotted
                        web; but the beam was held by a Hand Divine.</p>
                    <p>I lay on my bed, my once-tortured heart beating peacefully beneath my folded
                        hands. Ere the dawn-streaks had faded from the sky, Cyril stood beside me.</p>
                    <p>âMy son, arise! He who loves not the early morning loves not the memory of
                        his youth.â</p>
                    <p>I arose, and clad myself in the simple garments of this land. As I felt my
                        limbs free to bound, and the sweet morning air played round my bare throat,
                        and tossed my long wavy hair, it seemed to me that even these little things
                        influence man's character, and that he in whose soul dwells the love of the
                        beautiful, will ever follow nature's most perfect Art, in order that<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7020-095"></pb> in himself he may show, as far as he can,
                        the image of that grace which he delights to behold in others.</p>
                    <p>We quitted Cyril's dwelling, and went out towards the forest.</p>
                    <p>âWhither do you lead me, my kind guide?â I said.</p>
                    <p>He answered, âTo worship, with morning freshness,âthe God of the morning.â</p>
                    <p>He walked along a little further, quite silent, and then stood still. We were
                        in a narrow valley, lying east and west, enclosed on two sides by the gray
                        mountains and purple woods, and between them, from out the sea which bounded
                        the valley eastward, burst the sunwise. Oh! it was glorious!</p>
                    <p>âBeautiful! how beautiful is morning!â murmured Cyril. And turning round, he
                        said, âIt ever seems to me, dear kinsman, as though the earth at dawn
                        recovers its Eden-freshness; or that when night, the shadow of God's
                        protecting hand laid over it, is withdrawn, there comes a passing vision of
                        the glory departing.â</p>
                    <p>âIt is so,â I answered. âNay, it seems as though He who called Himself the
                        âbright and morning star,â and âthe Sun of Righteousness arising,â had
                        especially hallowed the dawn of day.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd meant that man should hallow it too. Therefore, come and see how we hail
                        the morning.â</p>
                    <p>I followed him far in the forest to a great temple. Its strong tree-pillars
                        had never been reared; they had risen of themselves through the mystic
                        inward principle of life, which no human power can give to<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7020-096"></pb> the meanest blade of grass. Its walls were formed
                        of interlacing verdure, its pavement tessellated with flowers. Through its
                        leafy arches rang the voices of innumerable choristers, invisible cherubs of
                        the air, hymning continually. And its roof was the blue infinite ether,
                        through which the moon climbed, and the stars wandered in their courses.
                        Upwards rose the prayers and praises of the worshippers; there was not one
                        human veil between them and heaven.</p>
                    <p>I heard from afar the loud song; I saw the multitude like that âwhich no man
                        can number;â every age, sex, and rank, uniting in the same solemn strain.
                        There, for the first time <emph>and the last</emph>, I beheld a church on
                        earth praising God with one voice.</p>
                    <p>âIs it the Sabbath?â I whispered.</p>
                    <p>âEvery day is a Sabbath here.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd the priest? I see none.â</p>
                    <p>âEvery man is a priestâa priest in his own household. Yet there are degrees
                        of honour, men called on to be teachers among the flock; but none says to
                        his brother, âStand aside, I am holier than thou;<choice>
                            <sic>â</sic>
                            <corr>â</corr>
                        </choice> none cries arrogantly, âMy truth is the only truth, and thine a
                        lie.â For we know that each flower may drink in the same sun, yet assume a
                        different hue, and give forth a different perfume, according to its nature
                        and clime. Forms are nothing: it is the spirit within which is the life.â</p>
                    <p>âStill,â I said, âthere can be but one sun and one dew to give that life.â</p>
                    <p>âYes,â he answered, âand if the flower grow strong and shed its odours, no
                        matter what flower it be, doubt<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7020-097"></pb> not but the
                        true life is there. How else could the fruits exist? Yet these are mysteries
                        amidst which the wisest among us can but grope blindly; only we know that
                        one day all will be made plain.â</p>
                    <p>âAmen!â said I, as the multitude arose from their knees, and their morning
                        worship done, went about that which is also a kind of worshipâdaily toil for
                        themselves and their dear households.</p>
                    <p>âBut,â said I unto Cyril, âI see here labour and endurance; Eden-land is then
                        no place of continual rest.â</p>
                    <p>âRest!â cried Cyril, while his brow shone with a prophet-like radiance. âDoes
                        the Omnipotent rest,âwhen He sends through the wide universe His love, which
                        is Himself? Do the angels rest when they traverse infinite space to do his
                        bidding? And think you that we shall rest when we become, like them,
                        ministering spirits? No; in earth or heaven there is not, there ought not to
                        be, any perpetual rest.â</p>
                    <p>As he ceased, we came to a little hill which overlooked a wide champaign.
                        There I saw the tokens of all necessary toil: the labourer delved the field,
                        the woodman cleared the forest, the manufacturer and mechanic plied their
                        handiwork, for ornament as well as use. I pondered awhile, and then said to
                        my guideâ</p>
                    <p>âAnother mystery comes to me. In this land there are both rich and poor?â</p>
                    <p>âThere are, because Eden-land is a reflex of the worldâour modern world.
                        Therein, while earth lasts,<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7020-098"></pb> rich and poor
                            <emph>must</emph> âmeet together.â Equality is but a fantastic dream.
                        Until men's natures are made all similar, their outward lives and
                        circumstances will vary. The oak and the bramble may spring from the same
                        soil, but one crawls on the earth while the other tops the forest. Yet the
                        same life-principle germinates in both.â</p>
                    <p>We stood where we could see at once town and hamlet, cottage and lordly
                        dwelling, the blue sky bending over all. And I began to moralize and think
                        how Heaven had made every created thing for good. I wondered if the world of
                        human hearts were pure and peaceful as the outer world which I beheld. So,
                        as we sat by the way-side, I spoke my thoughts to Cyril.</p>
                    <p>He smiled, and said my desire should be presently fulfilled. We reclined
                        under a woodbine-hedge; I lay pulling garlands of white convolvulus, and
                        thinking how strange it was to see again all the flowers I lovedâthe flowers
                        of earth, but far more beautiful. There came, rising and falling, the song
                        of the reapers in the field, and against the horizon twined and curled in
                        fairy wreaths, the smoke from the distant furnace where the metal-workers
                        plied their trade. There was poetry and happiness even in labour and
                        poverty.</p>
                    <p>As I mused there came past one of the gleaners; a girlâa very Ruthâladen with
                        golden-eared wheat, She went along singing, tossing the wavy sheaf over her
                        shoulder, and leading by the other hand an old man who crept feebly along.</p>
                    <pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7020-099"></pb>
                    <p>While he tottered on, the echoes of his cumbrous staff kept time to the
                        girl's light-hearted warble and as they passed us by and wound down the
                        hilly road, it seemed to me like the seraphs, Hope and Cheerfulness, making
                        music to the sound of Poverty's heavy tread. And like a sweet poem
                        accompanying the strain came Cyril's half-musing speech:â</p>
                    <p>âI do not believe that the All-merciful and Almighty ever created or
                        permitted evil. That which we call so, can be only a mysteriously-disguised
                        form of good. If want and sorrow were not, where then would be charity? If
                        none suffered, who could show love, pity, and sympathy? If help were never
                        needed, who could know the joy of gratitude? O man, canting of a sinful and
                        miserable world! how darest thou to speak thus of that earth on which its
                        Maker looked, âand behold it was very goodâ?</p>
                    <p>He sat, forgetting me and all else, in a reverie deep and calm. I looked on
                        the face, where every mark of earthly pain was obliterated, and I could have
                        knelt before him.</p>
                    <p>From our wayside-nook I marked many a passer-by. The poor man carolled gaily
                        on foot, the rich man rolled in his gay equipage, serene yet thoughtful; for
                        riches have many cares, and the great are Heaven's stewards upon earth. Then
                        came a various multitude, their faces not disguised with false smiles; but
                        each brow was clear as the day, each man's heart being written on his
                        countenance. Here was the region where none dreaded Truth.</p>
                    <pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7020-100"></pb>
                    <p>Yet there were as many varying shades of character as in the land from whence
                        I had drawn my being. The wise man raised his thoughtful brow to heavenâthat
                        heaven which seemed nearer to him than earth. Yet he was not lifted up by
                        pride, so as to scorn his brethren; but walked among them, humble as the
                        most unlearned of them all. The unlettered man, without mocking or envying
                        the gifts to which he could not aspire, moved on his lowly way, his
                        diligence and benevolence strewing earth with flowers, though they could not
                        make him wings to soar upward to the stars.</p>
                    <p>Women passed by, clad not in costly garments, but with that robe of meekness
                        which is above all price. Wearing it, they appeared perpetually fair; for a
                        beautiful soul makes a beautiful face, and she who is ever-loving, will
                        surely be loved evermore. In Eden-land were no neglected daughters,
                        estranged sisters, or forsaken wives; for each had learned that to love is
                        to win love, and that while man's glory is in a wise and tender sway,
                        woman's strength is often in her weakness; that from her cradle to her
                        grave, no woman was ever truly happy, unless she could look up to man in
                        some relation of lifeâeither father, brother, husband, or friend, and say,
                        humbly and lovingly, âI will obey thee, for thou art greater than I.â</p>
                    <p>These scenes I beheldâthese thoughts I pondered over; then I returned with
                        Cyril to the little cottage in the forest, and the sun set upon my first day
                        in Eden-land.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="b">IT</hi> was again dawn in the forest-temple; the worshippers
                        were departing, each his several way, to his home or to his merchandize. I
                        noticed the various groups, and my mind was bewildered with many
                        conjectures. Did there reign here, as in the olden world, the two mighty
                        ones, Love and Death? How, then, could perfect happiness exist?</p>
                    <p>I uttered my thoughts aloud, but Cyril smiled serenely at my doubts. He
                        answered them not, save by the meek and trusting speechâ</p>
                    <p>âAll that is, is good; we learn this lesson in Eden-land.â And then he
                        pointed to a train which had separated itself from the rest, and passed into
                        a green alley of linden-trees.</p>
                    <p>âLet us follow them!â</p>
                    <p>We did so. There was in the midst an old man, gentle and saint-like in mien,
                        to whom they all listened earnestly. He taught, not of religion, but of that
                        which is next to it in holinessâLove. He spoke of all tender affectionâof
                        kindred, of friendship, and lastly of that mysterious bond between man and
                        woman which heaven ordained to complete the being and fulfil the happiness
                        of eitherâtrue and faithful wedded love.</p>
                    <p>Love, then, was known here. I marvelled, remembering all its miseries on
                        earth: changed loveâhopeless loveâlost love. But as these doubts arose, they
                        faded before the words of him who spake, answering as it were to my inward
                        thought.</p>
                    <pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7020-102"></pb>
                    <p>âLove that changes is not loveâit is a dream, a delusion, an idol worshipped
                        with the senses, not the heart. Pure love is rarely hopeless, save through
                        wrong done each to the other, or evil coming from the world outside. And
                        lost loveâwho shall call that <emph>lost</emph> which heaven takes?
                        Therefore in this our happy dwelling, where there is no sin, there can be no
                        sorrow; and love, given to be man's chief joy, and out of which his own
                        erring will alone has created misery, is here no longer a curse but a
                        blessing.â</p>
                    <p>And as I looked around, on the faces of young and old there came a tender
                        light, a blushing joy, which echoed his words in smiles. I thought of the
                        world wherein I had once dwelt, and sighed to remember how man there made a
                        hell of what should have been a heaven.</p>
                    <p>Again the pastor spoke of the sacredness of love; how that between two young
                        hearts that leaned each to each like meeting flowers, no blast of human fate
                        should be suffered to come. Then he spoke of two who loved one anotherâbut
                        worldly fortune stood between, and Poverty's iron arms tore them asunder.</p>
                    <p>âShall this be, O my brothers?â he cried. âCome, ye childless ones! who have
                        none to inherit your countless stores, give unto these, and babes' voices
                        may yet rise up in prayer for you. Ye lonely onesâin whose heart love was a
                        fresh fountain, until God sent the Angel of Death to seal the waters on
                        earth, that they might spring forth purer and brighter in heavenâremember
                        the time of youth, and make these blest with<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7020-103"></pb> the blessedness to which ye yourselves once looked! All ye who know what
                        love is, bid these love one another, and be happy!â</p>
                    <p>While he yet spake, many came and showered offerings at his feet: aged
                        parents, whose children had gone away to be no longer supports on earth but
                        watching angels in heaven, and who, clinging feebly to each other, went
                        slowly following to their rest; womenâto whom the name of wife was a
                        long-vanished or never-fulfilled dreamâwho had learned to walk, meek and
                        hale, over the grave of love, the treasures of their virgin hearts unknown,
                        save to heaven and the unseen land of souls.</p>
                    <p>And then the whole multitude shouted and sang for joy, and went to seek the
                        bridegroom and the bride.</p>
                    <p>It was a marriageânot like earthly marriages, celebrated in pomp and gay
                        hypocrisy, but quiet, solemnâfull of a happiness too deep for mirth. The
                        young bride knelt, clothed in white, her head myrtle-garlanded. The wedding
                        guests were there, save those who loved them both: the mother who gave a
                        daughter and received a son; and the sisters who took into their dear circle
                        of affection one more, to whom âsisterâ had hitherto been an unuttered name.
                        She murmured it now in a tone which foretold gentle yielding, and household
                        peace between them all for evermore. Ruth-like, she had said in her heart,
                        âThy people shall be my people;â and in that spirit she came among them.
                        Once she turned, and knelt with her bridegroom for the blessing of the
                        mother whom she had made his<pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7020-104"></pb> mother also.
                        Then she arose, left all, and followed him who was to herâ <q>
                            <l>âFriend, father, brother, home, and universe!â</l>
                        </q></p>
                    <p>I stood with Cyril, and beheld this happy sightâthis true
                        <emph>marriage</emph>. In both our hearts was one thought; the same, and yet
                        different; there came to our lips one nameââLilias!â It was uttered with a
                        sigh, which might have been mournful; but in this land of peace and holiness
                        even the sting of sorrow was taken away. The regret for lost joy, and for
                        joy never realized, had alike grown calm. We looked upon it as souls
                        departed look back on their earth-sufferings; from whose immortal height of
                        perfect knowledge and perfect peace, the deepest woe appears only a light
                        cloud round the mountain's foot whose summit is in the skies.</p>
                    <p>Cyril and I grasped each other's hands, and left the scene.</p>
                    <p>The day fleeted like one of those quiet happy days of which every hour goes
                        by, leaving some grateful odour of duties performed and pleasures enjoyed;
                        and like this, Cyril said, passed every day in Eden-land. As we sat watching
                        the sunset over the western hills, there came into my mind solemn thoughts
                        of the closing of man's brief day. In the morning I had beheld the golden
                        shadow of the angel of Love; now it seemed to me that in the soughing of the
                        solemn trees, in the gathering clouds that darkened the sky, I felt the
                        presence of the angel of Death. I spoke my thoughts to Cyril, and he
                        answeredâ</p>
                    <pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7020-105"></pb>
                    <p>âIt may be so. Arise, and let us go forth to meet him.â</p>
                    <p>We went forth, up the mountain, towards the cottages of the mountaineers; and
                        as we climbed higher and higher, we seemed to follow the steps of the
                        departing sun, and the eventide became clear and beautiful, though solemn
                        still. It was a twilight less like the fading than the dawning day.</p>
                    <p>And like the twilight peace without was that which dwelt within the dwelling
                        which Cyril entered. There layâfeebly fluttering within its prison, waiting
                        the hour of its summonsâan immortal soul. As I crossed the threshold, I
                        seemed to feel the breath of the Death-angel who stood there, invisible,
                        with folded wings, until those pinions should be lifted to bear away one
                        sore spirit to the unseen land.</p>
                    <p>âHush! tread softly,â said a young man's voice. He who spoke arose from the
                        ground where he had been kneeling at the feet of two people, on whom he
                        gazed with the tenderness of an only child. They were both old; but the
                        woman's face, as it rested on her husband's breast, had a pallor deeper than
                        that of age. From the path they had long trodden together her feet were now
                        the first to glide. She knew itâhe knew itâand yet both leaned calmly, heart
                        to heart as ever, until the hour of parting should come. A brief parting it
                        wasâso brief, that they talked of it without a single tear.</p>
                    <p>She turned a little, and gave her hand to Cyril.</p>
                    <p>âI am going,â she said, and smiled.</p>
                    <pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7020-106"></pb>
                    <p>âThe blessing of all whom thy pure life has blessed, go with thee, my
                        sister,â he answered.</p>
                    <p>We all echoed âAmen:â even the aged husband and the son. They never so much
                        as said, âBeloved! stay with us a little longer;â for they knew that God had
                        called her. Who should set himself, his human will and human love, against
                        God's?</p>
                    <p>She spoke of many thingsâthings of earth-life's joys and its sorrows. She was
                        thankful for all, and showed how all had worked together for good. Much of
                        her speech was a mystery to me; but thus far I understoodâthat these, like
                        Cyril, had come through much affliction to the Happy Isle.</p>
                    <p>Then she laid her head closer to that true breast on which it had lain so
                        many years, and her feeble fingers twined themselves amidst the shining
                        curls of her tall son, who rested his cheek on her lap as though he were
                        again a little child. Thus she reclined, silently enclasped until death by
                        those whose love had brightened life. They waited with her: they went so
                        near the dark portal as almost to hear the echo of the voice that called;
                        and then they gave her from their tender arms, into those of God.</p>
                    <p>She was dead! No, not dead: she had only âgone away.â <emph>He</emph> said
                        so: the old man whose wife she had been; half of whose soul she had taken
                        with her to the eternal land. There was no murmuringâno weeping: for here,
                        they believed what the people of earth only <emph>said</emph>âthat death, a
                        righteous and peaceful death, is immortal gain. They knew that her spirit
                        was now<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7020-107"></pb> new-born into a diviner existence,
                        thence to rise, sphere after sphere, until its pure essence became one with
                        the All-Divine. So they laid her downâyet not <emph>her</emph>, but the
                        likeness of her beloved formâand went out, father and son clasped in each
                        other's arms. They stood looking upwards, following, as it were, her flight
                        among the stars.</p>
                    <p>I watched them with a solemn wonder. It had troubled me at first to think
                        that even in this happy place there was deathâawful deathâthe great
                        punishment of life. But now all was changed. I saw that nothing which God
                        ordains is <emph>punishment</emph>; that greater, far greater than they who
                        revelled in a perpetual Elysium of reposeâgreater than the many-centuried
                        dwellers in Avillion, were these of Eden-landâwho right pass through the
                        gate of death into immortality.</p>
                    <p>After a space, I know not whether of hours or daysâfor the time seemed
                        strange to meâI heard Cyril's voice sayingâ</p>
                    <p>âCome, my son, come with me into our garden!â</p>
                    <p>âIs it a fair garden?â I asked, as I walked with him.</p>
                    <p>âVery fair, in Heaven's sight!â</p>
                    <p>His words were strange; but I knew their import when he brought me to the
                        spot: a little dell, sheltered among the hills, and planted all thick with
                        flowersâat once an earthly and a heavenly garden. It was a place of graves.</p>
                    <p>Thither, while we entered, the son and the husband were bringing their
                        beloved dead.</p>
                    <pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7020-108"></pb>
                    <p>The burial was such as I had never seen in the former world. It was here no
                        more than laying in the earth holy seedâsown for the resurrection. No black
                        garments were allowedâno mock solemnities of crawling stranger-steps and
                        muffled stranger-faces. A few prayers were said, less to hallow the rest of
                        the deadâthat needed no hallowingâthan to speak peace and hope to the
                        living. Then the soft earth fell, a kindly veil; and flowers were planted
                        above, that no sign should be left of the mingling of dust with dust, save
                        what was beautiful and dear.</p>
                    <p>Thus, in the summer twilight, we all stood around the new mound in that
                        peaceful âgarden;â and the little birds sang, and one pale, beautiful star
                        came out in heaven, like the spirit of the departed watching us smilingly.</p>
                    <p>Then arose in the still air the voice of Cyril.</p>
                    <p>âWe thank Thee, O Lord of life, that thou hast for a season sent death into
                        Thy world, to make our faith eternal, and our love immortal as Thyself!â</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">THUS</hi> I dwelt with Cyril in Eden-land. Day by day we
                        traversed it together, and I learned all things pertaining thereunto. After
                        a space, my spirit began to turn within itself, and I pondered less over the
                        marvellous things around me than over my own individual life. I tried to
                        gather up the awful mysteries of my<pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7020-109"></pb> fate
                        since the day when I had lain on the bosom of ray Lilias, struggling with
                        the horrible pain from which the German mystic had freed me, only to plunge
                        me into worse horrors.</p>
                    <p>And when Cyril, watching my countenance, tried to read therein my thoughts, I
                        opened my heart to him and related the fearful tale. As I went on, my
                        passions rose; and the hatred and revenge with which the Mystic had inspired
                        me, filled my soul once more.</p>
                    <p>Cyril looked upon me with his calm eyes. âMy sonâmy son! there is yet much
                        alloy in that proud spirit. Know you not, that he who enters Eden-land must
                        learn as his first lessonâto forgive?â</p>
                    <p>âI forgive? Oh, Cyril! I cannot. It is bitterâbitter! Was he not worse than a
                        murderer? My own life was nothing: but Liliasâoh, Lilias!â</p>
                    <p>My heart melted within me: I could have wept!</p>
                    <p>He, too, was softened: he ever was at the sound of that name. But he gently
                        reproved me.</p>
                    <p>âWilfred, your fate is hard: but have you no pity for that miserable man? How
                        know you what undeserved suffering he might have enduredâwhat torments might
                        have goaded him on to seek the Happy Isles. You are at peaceâthen pardon
                        him.â</p>
                    <p>âI know no peace,â I cried. âMy soul yearns even here for home and for
                        Lilias. Oh, friend and kinsman, is there nothing to kill this worm that
                        continually gnaws at my heartâthe bitter memory of the past?â</p>
                    <p>Cyril answered solemnlyâ</p>
                    <p>âHe who has pardoned, or will pardon, the sins<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7020-110"></pb> of the whole worldâthe whole universeâforbids us
                        to know peace, even here, until we too have pardoned all our enemies.<choice>
                            <sic></sic>

                        </choice></p>
                    <p>I sat speechless, in a dull despair.</p>
                    <p>âThen let me die!â was my thought; but I dared not breathe it. To dieâto pass
                        unforgiving into the presence of the All-Merciful!</p>
                    <p>âComeâgo with me, my son, and I will show you it is not so hard to forgive.â</p>
                    <p>I followed Cyril, even to the âgarden.â There, beside the little mound which
                        his own hands had so lately raised, sat the husband of the dead. He was
                        watering the flowers, and playing with them tenderly, as if they were his
                        children.</p>
                    <p>âHerman,â said Cyril, as the old man raised his meek and placid face, âtell
                        this young passionate spirit that shrinks from forgiving wrongâtell my son
                        Wilfred the story of thy life, and that of the pure soul who is now with
                        God.â</p>
                    <p>âShe was a pure, beautiful soul. ever! And she suffered much wrong; but she
                        forgave it allâall! Must I indeed recount these things again?â said the old
                        man, dreamily.</p>
                    <p>There was no answer, and he continuedâ</p>
                    <p>âShe was of your land, Cyrilâthe land which on earth is renowned for its
                        wealth, its wisdom, and its just laws. Just laws? Merciful Heaven! is there
                        justice beneath the sun?â</p>
                    <p>He paused a moment, and then went onâ</p>
                    <p>âI was a stranger and a foreigner, and she an English<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7020-111"></pb> girl, yet she loved me. I came of a wild,
                        half-mad race (so men said), yet still she loved me. There was none to rule
                        her except an old, rich, cruel woman, with whom she dwelt. This wretch
                        turned me from the door, like a dog, and put me openly to shame. Then my
                        gentle love aroseârose like a tigress bereft of her young; she said
                        aloudâmark the words, for they were marked, ay, and for blood!ââ<emph>that
                            retribution would follow.</emph>â</p>
                    <p>âThat night the wicked woman lay slain in her bed, and they snatched my
                        newly-married wife from my arms, and accused her as a murderess.</p>
                    <p>âO evil, evil world! O horrible destiny which wrapped her round as with a
                        coil! My pure innocence! To say that the little hand which I cherished like
                        a bird in my bosom, bore on it the life-drops of a murdered human creature!</p>
                    <p>âWell, the bloodhounds of the law hunted her down: they made all clear, even
                        to the mark of her fairy feet, fled trembling to me when the house was
                        stillâshe knowing not whence the awful stillness came. It was all
                        plainâplain enough for the law to believe in; though some tender, merciful
                        souls, who felt the responsibility of that accusation which can rarely be
                        definitely proved, on whose truth or falsehood hangs a human lifeâthese
                        still doubted of her guilt. But their few faint arguments were vain. Her
                        doom was pronouncedâthe doom of <emph>DEATH</emph>!</p>
                    <p>âI dare not speak of myself or her: I speak of the world. I cryâas I had done
                        then, but despair made<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7020-112"></pb> me mad and dumbââO
                        man, how darest thou set thyself in the place of God, to judge life and
                        death! How darest thou wrest His Word to sanction murder? When He said
                        âblood for blood,â He ruled His people with a visible sway: His eye
                        inevitably marked the slayer. Can <emph>thine</emph>? Art thou omniscient
                        too? Know that if one man perish innocent, it is enough to lay on thy head,
                        and on the head of each administrator of a cursed law, the sin of Cain the
                        murderer!ââ</p>
                    <p>As he ceased, the old man sank on the grass exhausted; but his terrible words
                        rang on my ear like a judgment. Oh, that through me they might pierce the
                        world!</p>
                    <p>He spoke again, fainter:â</p>
                    <p>âHer doom approached. Pleadings for mercy came: âShe was so young! Even if
                        guilty, it was hard to die!â But the law's iron tongue knelled, âLet her
                        die!â and man echoed it. One, a priest, even preached the justice of taking
                        life for lifeâO God! and this man called himself a disciple of Him who was
                        put to death at Calvary!</p>
                    <p>âHour after hour fled; each tick of the clock falling on my ear like
                        blood-drops. I sat beneath the dial, and as it moved I cursed Timeâaye,
                        almost Him who created Timeâthat it should be made the instrument of a slow
                        death! Each man that passed me by, carelessly lounging through the brief
                        hours on which hung another life, precious as his own, I yelled after him,
                        âThou, too, art a murderer!â</p>
                    <p>âAt last but one day came between her and death.<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7020-113"></pb> Then, and not till then, they suffered me to feel
                        the peace of her presence; for it was peace, even then. Her words fell on my
                        burning heart like dew. Her meekness was beautiful, her forgiveness was
                        sublime! She clung to my bosom; she knelt at my feet: she stopped my
                        outcries of despair with embraces, my curses with prayers.</p>
                    <p>âThose who stood by melted into tears, and one who half-believed her guilty,
                        went forth from the cell to spend his whole existence in striving to annul
                        that terrible law of death by which man arrogates to himself the judgments
                        of God.</p>
                    <p>âWhen the first paroxysm was over, her calmness made me calm. I entreated,
                        and that good man who went from us entreated also, that we might have a
                        brief space alone. The law which robs its victims of a whole precious
                        lifetime of repentance or atonement might well grant the mercy of a few
                        short minutes, whether to guilt or innocence: so it was permitted to her.</p>
                    <p>âI took her in my arms and cradled her in my breast; my darling, on whose
                        sinless brow lay the brand of murder! Suddenly the thought came,âthat one
                        day moreâand the form I clasped, the fair neck whereon my kisses rained,
                        wouldâ</p>
                    <p>âMy blood curdled into ice, and then a horrible determination entered my
                        soul. I said, in a hissing whisper, âLove, I will save thee!â and I showed
                        her a ring I wore, small and beautiful, but which shut up within it
                        poisonâdeath. âSweetest, it is nothing; it<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7020-114"></pb>
                        will come in a moment, like sleep. My beloved, have pity on us both! let me
                        save thee.â</p>
                    <p>âShe looked amazed and doubting: âHow?â</p>
                    <p>ââWilt thou, now, in my safe arms,âwilt thou die?â</p>
                    <p>âShe drew herself from meânot in alarm, but in meek reproach:</p>
                    <p>ââNo, love, not even for thee! I am in God's hands. I will not take the life
                        He gave.â</p>
                    <p>âShe snatched the ring, from me, and trampled it under foot.</p>
                    <p>âWe were to have one more interviewâthe last. But ere it came, a superhuman
                        energy and cunning had dawned within me, and taught me how to save her. My
                        father, a German physician, was a man of wondrous knowledge. From him I had
                        learned a secret which would make the frame as rigid as stone, so as to be
                        for a time insensible to all assaults against life, while it preserved all
                        the appearance of death, until suspended animation returned. I made the
                        elixir: I calculated allâthe time before it would take effect, and how long
                        its power would last. I hid the tiny phial; fastening it by a hair among my
                        long, thick curls; and then I went to the prison.</p>
                    <p>âWhen, human agony mastering all her strength, she lay fainting in my arms, I
                        dropped on her lips the potion, death-bringing yet life-restoring, and then
                        I went away, without a farewell.</p>
                    <p>âI heard the howl of the multitude, the thousands met to gloat over the sight
                        of a slaughter according to<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7020-115"></pb> lawâa score of
                        men formally destroying one helpless woman, who seemed already dead.</p>

                        himself up to justice, and the ministers of the lawâay, some of them honest

                        innocent blood!</p>
                    <p>âI let them think so; I wished the curse to sink them to the lowest deep; and
                        then I snatched from them my own pure dead, and fled. She woke to life and
                        happiness upon her husband's breast!</p>
                    <p>âI wrote to my poor dream-haunted father, a German philosopher, whose worn
                        brain was already half maddened with misery, and bade him seek us in the
                        West, where human wickedness could trouble us no more. Then we two, my wife
                        and I, sailed far away. But doom followed us still. The vessel never reached
                        the landâat least, no earthly land. <emph>That</emph> happenedâwhich I may
                        not speak of to earthly earsâand we and all the ship's crew came hither to
                        the island of peace. Thank God, bless God, for all!â</p>
                    <p>âAnd thy father?â I cried, while a sudden light darted through my mind; âtell
                        me who was thy Father?â</p>
                    <p>âWe forget all such sorrows here; but his name on earth was Johann Foerster.â</p>
                    <p>I fell on my knees:â</p>
                    <p>âBear witness, heaven! that now at last from the bottom of my soul <emph>I
                            forgive</emph>!â</p>

                    <p>Then I told him my story, and we embraced one another, and were at peace.</p>
                    <p>While we yet sat in the holy âgardenâ and talked, our speech was broken by a
                        heavy thundering sound which came from the overhanging hills. I looked up,
                        and saw that a portion of the rock had loosened from its place, and was
                        falling, bringing death in its passage, to the plain beneath. A moment more,
                        and, shuddering, I saw that right in the path of this avalanche of doom lay
                        sleeping a young mountaineer. It was Herman Foerster's son!</p>
                    <p>With the speed of thought I sprang up the crags, my feet sinking at each
                        step. I reached the spot; I shook him out of his sleep; but he clung to me,
                        half bewildered still. It was too late. I heard the father's shriek; I saw
                        Cyril's upturned face; and then the thunder rolled over us, stunning,
                        deafening. It passed, and we were both alive.</p>
                    <p>Alive! but for how long? The ground had been torn from under us. We stood on
                        a jutting precipiceâa mere speck left between the perpendicular rock above
                        and the yawning abyss below. Even this narrow spot of safety crumbled and
                        quivered beneath our feet. We were two, and there was room but for one.</p>
                    <p>I paused. Revenge lay in my grasp. The grandson of Johann Foerster, the youth
                        in whose veins ran my enemy's blood, was in my hands. Which should it
                        beâlife or death? vengeance or self-sacrifice? Life or death, revenge or
                        sacrifice!</p>
                    <pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7020-117"></pb>
                    <p>My choice was made. In one sigh of prayer I committed my soul to God; in one
                        murmur I uttered the name of Lilias; then, with one farewell grasp of the
                        boy's hand, I plunged into the awful void below.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="*    *    *    *    *    *"></milestone>
                    <p>I awoke. Oh, marvel beyond belief! I lay on the vessel's deckâI felt round my
                        neck those dear soft arms. All had been a dream!</p>
                    <p>I heard the tender voice of my wife:â</p>
                    <p>âWilfred, dearest, you have slept scarce an hour, and you wake, all calm, and
                        so well!â</p>
                    <p>I leaned my head on her bosom, and our tears mingled together. Then I met the
                        kind, half-melancholy gaze of the old German mystic. Lilias turned even from
                        me to clasp his hand, and thank him.</p>
                    <p>He repliedâ</p>
                    <p>âThank not me, but God!â</p>
                    <p>I spoke to him, the mistiness of my dream, which I knew was only a dream,
                        struggling vainly with reality:â</p>
                    <p>âDear friend, stay with us, and let us be to you in the stead of all you have
                        lost!â</p>
                    <p>But he only shook his head, and said meeklyâ</p>
                    <p>âIt is impossible! I have not yet found the Happy Isles!â</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="*   *   *   *   *   *"></milestone>
                    <p>In our dear homeâthe home my wandering fancy picturedâI dwell with Lilias.
                        The old house is musical with sweet young voices; baby footsteps patter,
                        fairy-like, through its dim chambers. It is<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7020-118"></pb> indeed a haunted houseâhaunted by all good spirits of peace, and
                        happiness, and love. Lilias and I look towards the future and smile; the
                        shadows of death, and sickness, and sorrow, have passed from us, and we
                        shall grow old among our children's children.</p>
                    <p>Yet never, while life lasts, shall we altogether lose the memory of that
                        strange dream of mine.</p>

                    <p>â<hi>DAVIE CALDERWOOD</hi>! worthy tutor and master!âDavie Calderwood!ââThe
                        old man made no answer to the call, which he scarce seemed even to hear. He
                        sat not far from the shadow of his college walls, watching the little
                        silvery ripples of the Cam. His doctor's robes hid a homely dress of gray;
                        his large feet, dangling over the river bank, were clumsily shod, and his
                        white close-cropped hair gave him a Puritanical look, when compared with the
                        cavalier air of the two youths who stood behind him.</p>
                    <p>âDavie Calderwoodâwake up, man! News!âgreat news! And from Scotland!â added
                        the elder lad in a cautious whisper.</p>
                    <p>It pierced the torpor of the old man: he started up with trembling eagerness.</p>
                    <p>âEh, my dair bairn!âI mean, my lordâmy Lord Gowrie!â</p>
                    <pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7020-120"></pb>
                    <p>âHush!â said the youth, bitterly; âlet not the birds of the air carry that
                        sound. Was it not crushed out of the earth a year ago? Call me William
                        Ruthven, or else plain William, till with my good sword I win back my title
                        and my father's name.â</p>
                    <p>âWillieâWillie!â murmured the younger brother, in anxious warning.</p>
                    <p>âHe's fearedâwee Patrick!â laughed William Ruthven. âHe thinks that walls
                        have ears, and rivers tongues, and that every idle word I say will go with
                        speed to the vain, withered, old hag in London or to daft King Jamie in
                        Edinburgh! He thinks he shall yet see brother Willie's love-locks floating
                        from the top of the Tolbooth beside those of winsome Aleck and noble John.â</p>
                    <p>The elder youth spoke in that bitter jesting tone used to hide keenest
                        suffering; but the younger one, a slight delicate boy of nineteen, clung to
                        his brother's arm, and burst into tears.</p>
                    <p>âMy Lord,â said Master David Calderwood, âye suld be mair tender o' the
                        ladâyour ae brotherâyour mother's youngest bairn! Ye speak too lightly o'
                        things awfu' to tell ofâawfu' to mind. Master Patrick,â he added, laying his
                        hand gently on the boy's shoulder, âye are thinking of ilk puir bodie given
                        to the fowls of the air and to the winds of heaven at Stirling, Edinburgh,
                        and Dundee; but ye forget that while man dishonours the helpless dust,
                        evermair God keeps the soul. Therefore think ye thus o' your twa
                        brothersâthe bonnie Earl of Gowrie, and<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7020-121"></pb>
                        noble Alexander Ruthvenâthat are baith now with God.â</p>
                    <p>As he spoke, the doctor's voice faltered, for nature had put into his huge,
                        ill-formed frame a gentle spirit; and though he had fled from his country,
                        and never beheld it since the year when his beloved lord, the first Earl of
                        Gowrie, and father of these youths, perished on the scaffoldâstill, amidst
                        all the learning and honours gained in his adopted home, David Calderwood
                        carried in his bosom the same true Scottish heart. Perhaps it yearned more
                        over the boy Patrick, in that he was, like his long-dead father, a quiet
                        retiring student, given to all abstruse philosophy; whereas William, the
                        elder, was a youth of bold spirit, who chafed under his forced retirement,
                        and longed to tread in the footsteps of his ancestors, even though they led
                        to the same bloody end.</p>
                    <p>âWell, good master,â he said, âwhen you have wept enough with Patrick, hear
                        my news.â</p>
                    <p>âIs it from your mother, the puir hunted dove, auld and worn, flying hither
                        and thither about the ruins of her nest?â</p>
                    <p>Lord Gowrie'sâlet us give him this title, borne for three months, then
                        attainted, but which yet fondly lingered on the lips of two faithful
                        friends, David Calderwood and Lettice his daughterâLord Gowrie's brow
                        reddened, and instinctively he put his hand to where his sword should have
                        hung. Then he muttered angrily, âAh, I forget I am no earl, no Scottish
                        knight, but only a poor Cambridge student. But,â he added, his face
                        kindling, âthough the lightning has fallen on the parent<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7020-122"></pb> trunk and its two brave branches, and though the
                        rest are trodden under foot of men, still there is lifeâbold, fresh life in
                        the old tree. It shall grow up and shelter her yetâmy noble, long-enduring
                        motherâthe first, the best, theâNo; she shall <emph>not</emph> be the last
                        Lady Gowrie.â</p>
                    <p>While speaking, a flush deeper even than that of youth's enthusiasm burned on
                        the young earl's cheek, and he looked up to the window where Lettice
                        satâsweet Lettice Calderwood, sweeter even than she was fair! She at a
                        distance dimly saw the look; she met it with a frank smileâthe smile a
                        single-hearted, happy girl would cast willingly on all the world.</p>
                    <p>âThe newsâthe news!â murmured old David. âMy bairns, ye talk and ye rave, but
                        ye dinna tell the news.â</p>
                    <p>âMy mother writes that the cloud seems passing from our house; for the Queen
                        Anneâshe favours us still, despite her lordâthe Queen Anne has secretly sent
                        for our sister Beatrice to court.â</p>
                    <p>âBeatrice, whom brother Alexander loved more than all of us,â said Patrick.
                        But the elder brother frowned, and rather harshly bade him hold his peace.</p>
                    <p>âPatrick is a child, and knows nothing,â said the young Earl; âbut I know
                        all. What care I for this weak Queen's folly or remembered sin? What care I
                        whether my bold brother Alexander encouraged her erring love or not, if
                        through her means I creep back into my father's honoured seat? Oh shame that
                        I <emph>can</emph> only creep; that I must enter Scotland like a thief, and
                        steal in at the court holding on to a woman's robe, when<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7020-123"></pb> I would fain come with fire and sword, to crush
                        among the ashes of his own palace the murderer of my race!â</p>
                    <p>He spoke with a resolute fierceness, strange in such a youth; his black brows
                        contracted, and his stature seemed to swell and grow. Simple Davie
                        Calderwood looked and trembled.</p>
                    <p>âYe're a Ruthven, true and bold; but ye're no' like the Earl o' Gowrie. I see
                        in your face your father's fatherâhim that rose from his dying bed to be a
                        shedder of bloodâhim that slew Rizzio in Holyrood!â</p>
                    <p>âAnd when I stand in Holyroodâwhether I creep in there or force my way with
                        my swordâI will kneel down on that bloody spot, and pray Heaven to make
                            <emph>me</emph> too as faithful an avenger.â</p>
                    <p>Then turning off his passion with a jest, as he often did, Lord Gowrie said
                        gaily to his brother, âCome, Patrick, look not so pale; tell our good master
                        the rest of the newsâthat to-night, this very night, thou and I must start
                        for bonnie Scotland!â</p>
                    <p>âWho is talking of bonnie Scotland?â said a girl's voice, young indeed, but
                        yet touched with that inexplicable tone which never comes until life's first
                        lessons have been learnedâthose lessons, whether of joy or grief, which
                        leave in the child's careless bosom a woman's heart.</p>
                    <p>Lord Gowrie turned quickly and looked at Letticeârapturously, yet bashfully,
                        as a youth looks at his first idol. Then he repeated his intention of
                        departure, though in a tone less joyous than before. Lettice heard,<pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7020-124"></pb> without emotion, as it seemed, only that
                        her two thin handsâshe was a little creature, pale and slightâwere pressed
                        tightly together. There are some faces which, by instinct or by force of
                        will, can hide all feeling, and then it is often the hands which tell the
                        taleâthe fluttering fingers, the tight clench, the palms rigidly crushed
                        together. But these tokens of suffering no one sees: no one saw them in
                        Lettice Calderwood.</p>
                    <p>âDo ye no grieve, my daughter, over these bairns that go from us? Wae's me!
                        but there's danger in ilka step to baith the lads.â</p>
                    <p>âAre both going?â asked Lettice; and her eye wandered towards the younger
                        brother, who had moved a little apart, and stood by the little river,
                        plucking leaves, and throwing them down the stream. âIt is a long, severe
                        journey, and Master Patrick has been so ill, and is not yet strong,â added
                        the girl, speaking with that grave dignity which, as mistress of the
                        household, she sometimes assumed, and which made her seem far older than her
                        years.</p>
                    <p>âPatrick is a weakly fellow, to be sure,â answered Lord Gowrie, inwardly
                        smiling over his own youthful strength and beauty; âbut I will take care of
                        himâhe will go with his brother.â</p>
                    <p>âYes,â said Patrick, overhearing all, as it appeared. But he said no more: he
                        was a youth of few words. Very soon Calderwood and the young Lord began to
                        talk over the projected journey. But Patrick sat down by the river-bank, and
                        began idly plucking and examining the meadow-flowers, just as if his
                            favourite<pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7020-125"></pb> herbal and botanical science
                        were the only interests of life.</p>
                    <p>âPatrick!â whispered Lettice's kind, sisterly voice. She sometimes forgot the
                        difference of rank and blood in her tender compassion for the young
                        proscribed fugitives who had been sent, in such utter destitution and
                        misery, to her father's careââPatrick!â</p>
                    <p>âYes, Mistress Lettice.â</p>
                    <p>âThe evening closes cold; take this!â She had brought a cloak to wrap round
                        him.</p>
                    <p>âYou are very kind, very thoughtfulâlike a <emph>sister</emph>.â Saying this,
                        he turned quickly, and looked at her. Lettice smiled. Whether gladsome or
                        sorry, she could always bend her lips in that pale, grave smile.</p>
                    <p>âWell, then, listen to me, as you always do; I being such a staid, wise old
                        womanââ</p>
                    <p>âThough a year younger than I.â</p>
                    <p>âStill, listen to me. My Lord Gowrie, your brother, is rash and bold; you
                        must be prudent for the sake of both. When you go from us, Patrick, cease
                        dreaming, and use your wisdom. You have indeed the strength and wisdom of a
                        man; it will be needed. Let not William bring you into peril; take care of
                        himâand of yourself.â</p>
                    <p>Here the lips that spoke so womanly, grave, and calm, began to tremble; and
                        Lettice, hearing her name called, went away.</p>
                    <p>Patrick seemed mechanically to repeat to himself her last words, whether in
                        pleasure, pain, or indifference, it was impossible to tell. Then his
                        features relapsed into<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7020-126"></pb> their usual
                        expressionâthoughtful, quiet, and passionless. An <emph>old-young</emph>
                        face it wasâa mingling of the child with the man of eld, but with no trace
                        of youth betweenâa face such as we see sometimes, and fancy that wve read
                        therein the coming history as plainly written as in a book. So whiile, as
                        the evening passed, Lord Gowrie's fiery spirit busied itself about plots and
                        schemes, the fate of kingdoms and of kingsâand David Calderwood, stirred
                        from his learned equipoise, troubled his simple mind with anxiety concerning
                        his two beloved pupilsâLettice hid all her thoughts in her heart, brooding
                        tremblingly over them there. But the young herbalist sat patiently pulling
                        his flowers to pieces, and ruminating meanwhile, his eyes fixed on the
                        little rippling stream. He seemed born to be one of those meek philosophers
                        who through life sit still, and let the world roll by with all its tumults,
                        passions, and cares. They are above it; or, as some would deem, below it.
                        But in either case it touches not them.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="âââ"></milestone>
                    <p>It was the dawn of a September day, gloomy and cold. All things seemed buried
                        in a dull sleep, except the Cam that went murmuring over its pebbles hour
                        after hour, from night till morn. Lettice heard it under her window, as she
                        stood in the pale light, fastening her head-tire with trembling hands. They
                        were just startingâthe two young Scottish cavaliers. Both had cast off the
                        dress of the student, and appeared as befitted their birth. Bold, noble, and
                        handsome looked the<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7020-127"></pb> young Earl William in
                        his gay doublet, with his sword by his side. As he walked with Lettice to
                        the garden (he had half-entreated, half-commanded to have a rose given by
                        her hand), his manner seemed less boyishâmore courtly and tender withal. His
                        last words, too, as he rode away, were a gay compliment, and an outburst of
                        youthful hope; alluding to the time when he should come back endowed with
                        the forfeited honours of his race, and choose, not out of Scottish but of
                        English maidens, a âLady Gowrie.â</p>
                    <p>Patrick, stealing after, a little palerâa little more silent than
                        usualâaffectionately bade his master adieu; and to the hearty blessing and
                        good-speed only whispered âAmen.â Then he took Lettice's hand; he did not
                        kiss it, as his brother had gracefully and courteously done; but he clasped
                        it with a light cold clasp, saying gently, âFarewell! Lettice, my kind
                            <emph>sister</emph>.â</p>
                    <p>She calmly echoed the farewell. But when the sound of the horses' feet died
                        away, she went slowly up to her little chamber, shut the door, sat down, and
                        wept. Once only, looking at her little handâholding it as if there still
                        lingered on it a vanished touchâthe deep colour rose in her cheek, and over
                        her face there passed a quick, sharp pang.</p>
                    <p>âHis sisterâalways his <emph>sister</emph>!â She said no more. After a while
                        she dried her tears, wrapped round her heart that veil of ordinary outer
                        life which a woman must always wear, and went down to her father.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="âââ"></milestone>
                    <pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7020-128"></pb>
                    <p>âLettice, what are these torn papers that thou art fastening together with
                        thy needle? Are they writings or problems of mine?â</p>
                    <p>âNot this time, father,â said Lettice, meekly; âthey are fragments left by
                        your two pupils.â</p>
                    <p>âThat is, by Patrick; William did not love to study, except that fantastic
                        learning which all the Ruthvens lovedâthe occult sciences. Whose papers are
                        these?â</p>
                    <p>âMaster Patrick's; he may want them when he returns.â</p>
                    <p>â<emph>When</emph>! Ah, the dear bairn, his puir father's ain son; will I
                        ever see his face again?â</p>
                    <p>There was no answer save that of silence and paleness. Lettice's fingers
                        worked on. But a dull, cold shadow seemed to spread itself over the
                        roomâover everywhere she turned her eyes; duller than the gloomy
                        eveningâcolder than the cold March rain which beat against the narrow
                        college-windows, that shadow crept over her heart. She looked like one who
                        for many days and weeks had borne on her spiritânot a heavy load, that is
                        easier to bear, but a restless struggleâsometimes pain, sometimes joyâdoubt,
                        fear, expectation, faithâwild longing, followed by blank endurance. It was
                        now a long time since she had learned the whole bitter meaning of those
                        words, âThe hope deferred which maketh the heart sick.â</p>
                    <p>âMy dear lassie,â said the old doctor, rousing himself from a mathematical
                        calculation which had degenerated into a mere every-day reverie, âwhere hae
                        ye keepit the puir young Earl's letter, that said<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7020-129"></pb> he and Patrick were baith coming back to
                        Cambridge in a week? Can ye no tell how lang it is sin syne?â</p>
                    <p>Lettice could have answered at onceâcould have told the weeks, days,
                        hoursâeach passing slowly like yearsâbut she did not. She paused as though
                        to reckon, and then she said, âIt is nigh two months, if I count right.â</p>
                    <p>âTwa months! Alas, alas!â</p>
                    <p>âDo you think, father,â she said, slowly, striving to speak for the first
                        time what had been so long pent up that its utterance shook her whole frame
                        with tremblingsââdo you think that any harm has come to the poor young
                        gentlemen?â</p>
                    <p>âI pray God, no! Lettice, do you mind what our puir WillieâI canna say âthe
                        Earlââtauld us of their great good fortune through the Queen; how that he
                        would soon be living in Edinburgh as a grand lord, and his brother should
                        end his studies at St. Andrews; only Patrick said he loved better to come
                        back to Cambridge, and to his auld master. The dear bairn! Do ye mind all
                        this, Lettice?â</p>
                    <p>âYes, father.â Ah, truly poor Lettice did!</p>
                    <p>âThen, my child, we needna fear for them. They are twa young gentlemen o'
                        rank, and maybe they lead a merry life, and that whiles gars them forget
                        auld friends; but they'll come back safe in time.â</p>
                    <p>So saying, the old doctor settled himself in his high-backed chair, and
                        contentedly went to sleep. His daughter continued her work until the papers
                        were all<pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7020-130"></pb> arranged, and it grew too dark to
                        see, then she closed her eyes and pondered.</p>
                    <p>Her thoughts were not what may be called love-thoughts, such as you, young
                        modern maidens, indulge in when you dream of some lover kneeling at your
                        feet, or walking by your side, know yourselves adored, and exult in the
                        adoration. No such light emotion ruled Lettice's fancy. Her loveâif it
                            <emph>were</emph> love, and she scarce knew it as suchâhad crept in
                        unwittingly, under the guise of pity, reverence, affection; it had struck
                        its roots deep in her nature; and though it bore no flowers, its life was
                        one with the life of her heart. She never paused to think, âDo I love?â or
                        âAm I loved?â but her whole being flowed into that thought, wave after wave,
                        like a stream that insensibly glides into one channel, leaving all the rest
                        dry.</p>
                    <p>Lettice sat and thought mournfully over the many weeks of wearying
                        expectation for him who never came. How at first the hours flew, winged with
                        restless joy; how she lay down in hope, and rose in hope, and said to
                        herself, calmly smiling, âTo-morrowâto-morrow!â How afterwards she strove to
                        make those words into a daily balm to still fear and pain that would not
                        sleep; how at last she breathed them wildly, hour by hour of each blank day,
                        less believing in them than lifting them up like a cry of despair which
                            <emph>must</emph> be answered. But it never was answered; and the
                        silence now had grown so black and dull around her, that it pressed down all
                        strugglesâleft her not even strength for fears.</p>
                    <pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7020-131"></pb>
                    <p>She had feared very much at first. The young Earl William, so sanguine, so
                        bold, might have been deceived. The king's seeming lenity might be but
                        assumed, until he could crush the poor remnant of the Ruthven race. She
                        pondered continually over the awful tale of the Gowrie plot; often at night,
                        in her dreams, she saw the ensanguined axe, and the two heads, so beautiful
                        and young, mouldering away on the Tolbooth. Sometimes beside them she saw
                        anotherâHorror! she knew <emph>it</emph> wellâthe pale, boyish cheekâthe
                        thoughtful brow. Then she would wake in shudderings and cries; and falling
                        on her knees, pray that wherever he wasâwhether or no he might gladden her
                        eyes againâHeaven would keep him safe, and have pity upon her.</p>
                    <p>Again she thought of him in prosperity, living honoured and secure under the
                        glory of the Ruthven lineâforgetting old friends, as her father had said.
                        Well, and what right had she to murmur? She did notâsave that at times, even
                        against her will, the selfish cry of weak human tenderness would rise
                        upââAlas, thou hast all things, and IâI perish for want!â But her conscience
                        ever answered, âHe neither knows nor sees, so with him there is no wrong.â</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="âââ"></milestone>
                    <p>Night, heavy night, fell down once more. Lettice had learned to long for the
                        dull stupor it broughtâa little peace, a little oblivion mercifully closing
                        each blank day. âIs it not time for rest, father?â she<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7020-132"></pb> often asked long ere the usual hour; and she was
                        so glad to creep to her little bower-chamber, and shut out the moonbeams and
                        the starlight, and lie in darkness and utter forgetfulness, until lulled to
                        sleep by the ripple of the stream close by. There had been a time when she
                        had either sat up with her farther, or else lain awake until midnight,
                        listening for steps in the gardenâfor voices beneath the windowâwhen every
                        summons at the gate made her heart leap wildly. But all this was passed now.</p>
                    <p>Lettice put down the lamp, took off her coif, and unbound her hair. Before
                        retiring she opened the window, and gazed out into the night, which was
                        cold, but very clear. She half-leaned forward, and stretched out her hands
                        to the north. No words can paint the look her countenance wore. It was
                        yearning, imploring, despairing, like that of a soul longing to depart and
                        follow another soul already gone. In her eyes was an intensity that seemed
                        mighty enough to pierce through all intervening space, and fly, dove-winged,
                        to its desire. Then the lids drooped, the burning tears fell, and her whole
                        frame sank collapsed, an image of hopeless, motionless dejection.</p>
                    <p>She was roused by a noiseâthe dash of oars on the usually-deserted river. She
                        shut the window hastily, blushing lest the lamp should have revealed her
                        attitude and her emotion to any stranger without. The sound of oars
                        ceasedâthere were footsteps up the garden alleysâthere was her father's
                        eager voice at the<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7020-133"></pb> door, mingled with
                        other well-known voices. They were coming!âthey were come!</p>
                    <p>In a moment all the days, weeks, months of weary waiting were swept away like
                        clouds. The night of her sorrow was forgotten as though it had never been.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="âââ"></milestone>
                    <p>âAnd now that I am returned, thou wilt not give me another flower, Mistress
                        Lettice?â said the young Earl, as he followved her up the garden-walks in
                        the fair spring morning. She had risen early, for sleep had been driven away
                        by joy.</p>
                    <p>âThere are no flowers now, at least none gay enough to be worth your wearing.
                        Daisies and violets would ill suit that courtly dress,â said the maiden,
                        speaking blithely out of her full-hearted content.</p>
                    <p>âDoes it displease you, then? Shall I banish my silver-hilted sword, and my
                        rich doublet with three hundred points, and don the poor student's hodden
                        gray? I would do it, fair damsel, and willingly, for thee!â And he smiled
                        with a little conscious pride, as if he knew well that six months passed in
                        the precincts of a court had transformed the bashful youth into an
                        accomplished cavalierâbrave, handsome, winning, yet pure and noble at heart,
                        as the young knights were in the golden time of Sidney and of Raleigh.</p>
                    <p>Lettice regarded him in frank admiration. âTruly, my Lord Gowrie, you are
                        changed. Scarcely can I dare to give you the name you once honoured me by<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7020-134"></pb> permitting. How shall I call you and
                        Master Patrick my brothers?â</p>
                    <p>â<emph>I</emph> wish it not,â said the young man, hastily. âAs for
                        Patrickânever mind Patrick,â as Lettice's eyes seemed wandering to the
                        river-side, where the younger Ruthven sat in his old seat. âYou see he is
                        quite happy with his herbal and his books of philosophy. Let him stay there;
                        for I would fain have speech with you.â He led her into a shady path, and
                        began to speak hurriedly: âLettice, do you know that I may soon be summoned
                        back to Scotlandânot as a captive, but as the reinstated Earl of Gowrie?
                        And, Letticeââhere his voice faltered, and his cheek glowed, and he looked
                        no more the bold cavalier, but a timid youth in his first wooingââdear
                        Lettice, if I might win my heart's desire, I would not depart alone.â</p>
                    <p>âNot depart alone! Then thou wilt not leave Patrick with us, as was planned?â
                        said the girl, uttering the first thought that rose to her mind, and then
                        blushing for the same.</p>
                    <p>âI spoke not of Patrickâhe may do as he wills. I spoke of some one dearer
                        than brother or sister; of her whoââ</p>
                    <p>âWhat! is it come to that?â merrily laughed out the unconscious girl. âIs our
                        William, at once, without sign or token, about to bring to Cambridge, and
                        then carry away home, a bonnie Lady Gowrie?â</p>
                    <p>The Earl seemed startled by a sudden doubt. âIt is strange you should speak
                        thus! Are you mocking<pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7020-135"></pb> me, or is it a
                        womanly device to make me woo in plainer terms? Hear, then, Lettice! Lettice
                        that I love! It is you I would win, you whom I would carry home in triumph,
                        my beautiful, my wife, my Lady Gowrie!â She stood transfixed, looking at
                        him, not with blushes, not with maiden shame, but in a sort of dull amaze.</p>
                    <p>âDo my words startle you, sweet one? Forgive me, then, for I scarce know what
                        I say. Only I love youâI love you! Come to my heart, my Lettice, my bride
                        that shall be;â and he stretched out his arms to enfold her. But Lettice,
                        uttering a faint cry, glided from his vain clasp, and fled into the house.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="âââ"></milestone>
                    <p>In their deepest affections women rarely judge by outward show. The young
                        Earl, gifted with all qualities to charm a lady's eye, had been loved as a
                        brotherânothing more. The dreamy Patrick, in whose apparently passionless
                        nature lay the mystery wherein such as Lettice ever delightâwhose learning
                        awed, while his weakness attracted tender sympathyâhe it was who had
                        unconsciously won the treasure, which a man, giving all his substance, could
                        not gainâa woman's first, best love.</p>
                    <p>Her wooer evidently dreamed not of the truth. She saw him still walking where
                        she had left him, or passing under her window, looking up rather anxiously,
                        yet smiling. One thought only rose clearly out of the chaos of Lettice's
                        mindâthat he must be answered;<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7020-136"></pb> that she
                        must not let him deceive himselfâno, not for an hour. What she should say
                        she mournfully knewâbut how to say it? Some small speech she tried to frame;
                        but she had never been used to veil any thought of her innocent heart before
                        him she treated as a brother. It was so hard to feel that all this must be
                        changed now.</p>
                    <p>Lettice was little more than eighteen years old, but the troublous life of a
                        motherless girl had made her self-dependent and firm. Therefore, after a
                        while, courage came unto her again. Strengthened by her one great desire to
                        do right, she descended into the garden, and walked slowly down the alley to
                        meet the earl. His greeting was full of joy.</p>
                    <p>âDid I scare her from me, my bird? And has she flown back of her own accord
                        to her safe nestâher shelter now and evermore?â And he extended his arms
                        with a look of proud tenderness, such as a young lover wears when he feels
                        that in wooing his future wife he has cast off the lightsome follies of
                        boyhood, and entered on the duties and dignities of man.</p>
                    <p>Lettice never looked up, or her heart would have smote herâthat heart which,
                        already half-crushed, had now to crush another's. Would that women felt more
                        deeply how bitter it is to inflict this suffering, and if wilfully incurred,
                        how heavy is the sin! Even Lettice, with her conscience all clear, felt as
                        though she were half guilty in having won his unvalued love. Pale and
                        trembling she began to say the words she had fixed on as best, humblest,
                        kindestââMy Lord Gowrieââ</p>
                    <pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7020-137"></pb>
                    <p>âNay, sweet Lettice, call me William, as you ever used to do in the dear old
                        times.â</p>
                    <p>At this allusion her speech failed, and she burst into tears. âOh, William,
                        why did you not always remain my brother? I should have been happy then!â</p>
                    <p>âAnd now?â</p>
                    <p>âI am veryâvery miserable.â</p>
                    <p>There was a pause, during which Lord Gowrie's face changed, and he seemed to
                        wrestle with a vague fear. At last he said, âWherefore?â in a brief, cold
                        tone, which calmed Lettice at once.</p>
                    <p>âBecause,â she murmured, with a mournful earnestness there was no doubting or
                        gainsaying, âI am not worthy your love, since in my heart there is no
                        answerânone!â</p>
                    <p>For a moment Lord Gowrie drew himself up with all his ancestral pride.
                        âMistress Lettice Calderwood, I regret thatâthatââ He stammered, hesitated,
                        then throwing himself on a wooden seat, and bowing his head, he struggled
                        with a young man's first agonyârejected love.</p>
                    <p>Lettice knelt beside him. She took his passive hands, and her tears rained
                        over them; but what hope, what comfort could she give? She thought not of
                        their position as maiden and suitorâLord Gowrie and humble Lettice
                        Calderwoodâshe only saw her old playmate and friend sitting there
                        overwhelmed with anguish, and it was her hand which had dealt the blow.</p>
                    <p>âWilliam,â she said, brokenly, âthink not hardly of<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7020-138"></pb> me. I would make you happy if I could, but I
                        cannot! I dare not be your wife, not loving you as a wife ought.â</p>
                    <p>âIt is quite true, then, you do not love me?â the young Earl muttered. But he
                        won no other answer than a sad silence. After a while he broke out again
                        bitterlyââEither I have madly deceived myself, or you have deceived me. Why
                        did you blush and tremble when we met last night? Why, before we met, did I
                        see you gazing so longingly, so passionately, on the way I should have come?
                        Was that look false, too?â</p>
                    <p>Lettice rose up from her knees, her face and neck incarnadine. âMy Lord of
                        Gowrie, though you have honoured me, and I am grateful, you have no rightââ</p>
                    <p>âI <emph>have</emph> a rightâthat of one whose whole life you have withered;
                        whom you have first struck blind, and then driven mad for love! Mistress
                        CalderwoodâLetticeââ</p>
                    <p>In speaking this beloved name, his anger seemed to disperse and crumble away,
                        even as the light touch shivers the molten glass. When again he said
                        âLettice,â it was in a tone so humble, so heartbroken, that, hearing it,
                        she, like a very woman, forgot and forgave all.</p>
                    <p>âI never did you wrong, William: I never dreamed you loved me. In truth, I
                        never dreamed of love at all untilââ</p>
                    <p>âGo on.â</p>
                    <p>âI cannotâI cannot!â Again silence, again bitter tears.</p>
                    <pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7020-139"></pb>
                    <p>After a while Lord Gowrie came to her side, so changed, that he might have
                        lived years in that brief hour. âLettice,â he said, âlet there be peace and
                        forgiveness between us. I will go away: you shall not be pained by more
                        wooing. Only, ere I depart, tell me, is there any hope for me in patience,
                        or long waiting, or constant, much-enduring love!â</p>
                    <p>She shook her head mournfully.</p>
                    <p>âThen what was not mine to win is surely already won? Though you love not me,
                        still <emph>you love</emph>: I read it in your eyes. If so, I thinkâI think
                        it would be best mercy to tell me. Then I shall indulge in no vain hope: I
                        shall learn to endure, perhaps to conquer at last. Lettice, tell me: one
                        wordâonly one?â</p>
                    <p>But her quivering lips refused to utter it.</p>
                    <p>âGive some signalâay, the signal that used to be one of death!âlet your
                        kerchief fall!â</p>
                    <p>For one moment her fingers instinctively clutched it tighter, then they
                        slowly unclasped. The kerchief fell!</p>
                    <p>Without one word or look Lord Gowrie turned away. He walked, with something
                        of his old proud step, to the alley's end, then threw himself down on the
                        cold, damp turf, as though he wished it had been an open grave.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="âââ"></milestone>
                    <p>When the little circle next met, it was evident to Lettice that Lord Gowrie
                        had told the tale of his rejection to his faithful and loving younger
                        brother. Still<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7020-140"></pb> Patrick betrayed not his
                        knowledge, and went on in his old dreamy and listless ways. Once, as pausing
                        in his reading, he saw Lettice glide from the room, pale and very sad, there
                        was a momentary change in his look. It might be pity, or grief, or
                        reproach,ânone could tell. He contrived so as to exchange no private word
                        with her until the next morning; when, lounging in his old place, idly
                        throwing pebbles into the river, and watching the watery circles grow, mix,
                        and vanish, there came a low voice in his earâ</p>
                    <p>âMaster Patrick Ruthven!â</p>
                    <p>He started to hear his full name formally uttered by lips once so frank and
                        sisterly.</p>
                    <p>âWell; what would you, Lettice?â</p>
                    <p>âIt is early morning; there is no one risen but we two; come with me to the
                        house, for I <emph>must</emph> speak with you. And what I say even the air
                        must not carry. Come, Patrick; for the love of Heaven, come!â</p>
                    <p>Her face was haggard, her words wild. She dragged rather than led him into
                        the room where the two boys had once used to study with her father. There
                        she began speaking hurriedly.</p>
                    <p>âDid you hear nothing last night?âno footsteps?âno sounds?</p>
                    <p>âNo; yet I scarce slept.â</p>
                    <p>âNor I.â And the two young faces drooped, unable to meet each other. But soon
                        Lettice went on: âAt dawn, as I lay awoke, it seemed as if there were voices
                        beneath my window. I did not look: I thought it might beââ</p>
                    <pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7020-141"></pb>
                    <p>âWilliam sometimes rises very early,â said the brother gravely.</p>
                    <p>âIt was not Lord Gowrie, for I heard these strange voices speak his name.
                        Your hopes from King James were false! Oh, Patrick, there is dangerâgreat
                        danger! I have learned it all!â</p>
                    <p>âHow?â And rousing himself, the young man watched eagerly Lettice's agitated
                        mien.</p>
                    <p>âI opened the lattice softly, and listened. When they went away, I followed
                        stealthily to the water's edge. Patrick, they said that on the night but one
                        after this, they will return and seize you in the King's name! Flyâfly! Do
                        not let me lose for ever both my brothers!â</p>
                    <p>And she caught his hands as in her childhood she had used to do, when
                        beseeching him to do for her sake many things which, from dreamy
                        listlessness, he would never have done for his own.</p>
                    <p>âWhat must I do, LetticeâI, who know nothing of the world? Why did you not
                        tell all this to William?â</p>
                    <p>âIâtell William?â She blushed scarlet, and seemed struggling with deep
                        emotion.</p>
                    <p>âOh, trueâtrue!â Patrick said, and there seemed a faint waking up in his
                        passionless features. âNo matter; I will at once go and tell my brother.â</p>
                    <p>Lettice sat down to wait his return. All her murmur wasââOh, Williamâpoor
                        William!âso truly loving me whom others love not at all! I turned from thee
                        in thy prosperity, but now shall I save thee and lose<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7020-142"></pb> myself?âshall I sacrifice all to thee?â But
                        instinct rather than wisdom whispered to Lettice, that she who weds, knowing
                        her heart is not with her husband, wilfully sacrifices both. In the sight of
                        heaven and earth she takes a false vow, which, if requited not by man, will
                        assuredly be avenged by God.</p>
                    <p>Patrick Ruthven came back in much agitation. âHe says he will not fly; that
                        he heeds neither the prison nor the block; that he has no joy in life, and
                        death is best! Lettice, go to him: save himâyou only can!â</p>
                    <p>âHow can I save him?â mournfully Lettice cried.</p>
                    <p>âBy urging him to fly. We can take horse, and cross the country to Harwich,
                        whence a ship sails for France to-night. I know this, for yesterday I, too,
                        was planning how to depart.â</p>
                    <p>âYou?â</p>
                    <p>âNo matter,â said Patrick, hurriedly. âOnly go to William; compel him to save
                        his life: he will do so at your bidding.â</p>
                    <p>He spoke commandingly, as if fraternal love had transformed the gentle, timid
                        youth into a resolute man. Lettice, wondering and bewildered, mechanically
                        obeyed. She came to Lord Gowrie, who, with the disordered aspect of one who
                        has wasted the night in misery, not sleep, lay on the floor of what had been
                        the boys' play-room. To all her entreaties he only turned his face to the
                        wall, and answered not. At last his brother beckoned Lettice away.</p>
                    <p>Looking at Patrick, the girl marvelled. All his impassive coldness seemed to
                        have melted from him.<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7020-143"></pb> His stature appeared
                        to rise into dignity, and there was a nobility in his face that made it
                        beautiful to see. Lettice beheld in him, for the first time, the likeness of
                        what she knew he would one day becomeâa grand, true man; the man before whom
                        a woman's heart would instinctively bow down in Eve-like submission,
                        murmuringââI have found thee, my greater selfâmy head, my sustainer, and
                        guide.â</p>
                    <p>Patrick stood silent awhile, sometimes reading her face, sometimes casting
                        his eyes downward, as it were struggling, with inward pain. At last he said,
                        solemnly, âLettice, this is no time for idle scruple. I know all that took
                        place yesterday. I know, too, that there is one only chance, or William is
                        lost. Is your will so firm that it cannot change? Must he die through loving
                        youâmy dear, my noble brother, whom I would give my poor life to save?
                        Lettice, in this great strait I entreat youâeven I;ââand he shuddered
                        visiblyââConsider what you do. It is an awful thing to have life and death
                        in your hands. I beseech you, let him love you, and be happy.â</p>
                    <p>Lettice listened. As he spoke, slowlyâslowlyâthe young rich blood faded from
                        her face; she became rigid, white, and cold; all the life left was in her
                        eyes, and they were fixed on Patrick, as it were the last look of one dying.</p>
                    <p>âAnswer me,â she said, with a measured, toneless voiceââanswer truly, on your
                        soul. Do <emph>you</emph> desire this of me? Is it <emph>your</emph> wish
                        that I should become your brother's wife?â</p>
                    <pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7020-144"></pb>
                    <p>âMy wishâmy wish?â he muttered, and then his reply came clear and distinct as
                        one says the words which fix the sentence of a lifetime, âIn the sight of
                        God, yes!â</p>
                    <p>Lettice gave him her hand, and he led her again to his brother.</p>
                    <p>âI need not stay,â he whispered: âyou, Lettice, will say allâbetter say it at
                        once.â</p>
                    <p>She looked at Patrick with a bewildered, uncertain air, and then began to
                        speak.</p>
                    <p>âLord Gowrieâthat is, William, Iââ</p>
                    <p>She said no more, but fell down at Patrick's feet in a deathlike swoon.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="âââ"></milestone>
                    <p>Lettice lay insensible for many hours. For her there were no farewellsâwhen
                        she awoke, the two brothers were gone. She found on her neck a golden chain,
                        and on her finger a ring, the only tokens of the last passionate embraces
                        which William had lavished on her whom he now considered his betrothed. But
                        she herself remembered nothing. And when they told her, she flung away the
                        ring and chain, and prayed Heaven that she might die before ever Lord Gowrie
                        came to claim her vows.</p>
                    <p>Of the younger Ruthven, she could learn nothing either from her bewildered
                        father or her old nurse, except that Patrick had forcibly torn his brother
                        away. He had not spoken, save leaving a kind farewell to <emph>his
                        sister</emph>.</p>
                    <pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7020-145"></pb>
                    <p>In the twilight Lettice rose from her bed. She could not, for any inward
                        misery, neglect her good father. And all her senses had been so stunned,
                        that as yet she was scarce alive either to the present or the furture. She
                        sat almost as if nothing had happened, listening to the old man's broken
                        talk, or idly watching the graceful smoke-wreaths of the Virginian weed that
                        Sir Walter Raleigh had just introduced, and with which rare luxury the young
                        knight's friendship had provided David Calderwood.</p>
                    <p>Oppressed by the sudden events which had greatly discomposed the tenor of his
                        placid existence, the worthy doctor smoked himself to sleep. When with his
                        slumbers Lettice's duties ceased, her bitter grief rose up. It choked herâit
                        seemed to make the air close and fiery, so that she could not breathe. Dark
                        and cold as the March night was, she fled out. But she kept in the thick
                        alleys of the gardenâshe dared not go near the river, lest out of its cool,
                        cool depths should rise a demon, smilingly to tempt her there.</p>
                    <p>But at length, when the moon came out from under a black cloud, Lettice
                        thought she would approach and sit in Patrick's old seat by the side of the
                        Cam, where in summer nights they had spent hoursâshe, with girlish romance,
                        looking up at the stars, and he teaching her all concerning them in his
                        learned fashion, for the boy was a great astronomer.</p>
                    <p>Was it a vision? that he sat there still, in his old attitude, leaning
                        against the willow-tree, the light slanting on his upturned brow? Her first
                            thought<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7020-146"></pb> was, that he had met some
                        fearful end, and this was his apparition only. She whispered faintly,
                        âPatrick;â but he neither spoke nor moved. Then she was sure she beheld the
                        spirit of her beloved. Her highly-wrought feelings repelled all fear, and
                        made her take a strange joy in this communication from the unseen world.</p>
                    <p>Once more she called him by his name, adding thereto words tenderer than his
                        living self would ever hear. Then, seeing that the moon cast his shadow on
                        the water, the conviction that it was no spirit but his own bodily form,
                        made her start and glow with shame. Yet when she approached, he lay quite
                        still, his eyes were closed, and she could almost have believed him dead.
                        But he was only in a deep sleep, overpowered by such heavy exhaustion that
                        he hardly seemed to breathe.</p>
                    <p>Lettice crept beside him. Scarce knowing what she did, she took his cold hand
                        and pressed it to her breast. There, suddenly awaking, he felt it closely
                        clasped; and met a gaze pure and maidenly, yet full of the wildest
                        devotionâa look such as man rarely beholds, for the deepest tenderness is
                        ever the most secret. Scarce had Patrick seen it, than it melted into
                        Lettice's ordinary aspect; but he <emph>had</emph> seen it, and it was
                        enough.</p>
                    <p>âWhen did you come back?â faintly asked Lattice.</p>
                    <p>âAt twilight: a day's hard riding exhausted me, and I suppose I fell asleep
                        here.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd wherefore did you return?â Mechanical were the questions and replies, as
                        though both spoke at random.</p>
                    <pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7020-147"></pb>
                    <p>âWhy did I return?â</p>
                    <p>âYesâto danger. Oh, Patrick, how shall we save you? Why did you not sail with
                        William, if he has sailed?â</p>
                    <p>âHe has! There was a passage for one onlyâhis life was the most preciousâhe
                        is my elder brother, so I persuaded him to go on board; and thenâI left
                        him.â</p>
                    <p>âPatrickâPatrick!â Unconsciously she looked up at him in her old childish,
                        loving way, and her eyes were full of tears.</p>
                    <p>âAre you glad, Lettice?â</p>
                    <p>âGlad, because you have done a noble thing. But if through this you should be
                        discovered and taken; if Iâthat is, we allâshould lose youâHush!â That
                        instant her quick ear, sharpened by terror, heard down the river the sound
                        of oars. âThey are comingâthose men I saw last night; they will have brought
                        the King's warrant that I heard them speak of. It is too late. Oh, would
                        that you at least had been saved!â</p>
                    <p>âI, and not William?â His words spoke grave reproach, but his beaming looks
                        belied his tone.</p>
                    <p>âI think not of William now. Why did he go and leave you to perish? But I
                        will not leave you; Patrick, I will die with youâIââ</p>
                    <p>âLettice!â He began to tremble violently, took her hand and looked
                        questioningly into her eyes. There seemed a doubt suddenly furling off from
                        his mind, so that all was light and dayâay, even though nearer every minute
                        came the distant sounds which warned him of his danger.</p>
                    <pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7020-148"></pb>
                    <p>âHark! they are close upon us;â said Lettice, in an agonized whisper. âThey
                        will search the house through: what must be done?â</p>
                    <p>âI know not,â answered Patrick, dreamily.</p>
                    <p>âBut I know: comeâcome!â</p>
                    <p>She drew him cautiously into a laurel thicket close by, which, lying deep in
                        shadow, furnished a safe hidingplace. Thinking a moment, she took off her
                        black mantle and wrapped it over him, that his light-coloured doublet might
                        not be seen through the boughs.</p>
                    <p>âWe may escape them,â she said: âwe two have hidden here many a time when we
                        were children.â</p>
                    <p>âAh, Lettice!â he sighed, âwe were happy then! Even now, if William had not
                        loved youââ</p>
                    <p>âHush! they are landing; I hear their stepsâkeep close.â She made him kneel
                        so that her dress might hide him, and, as fearing that his fair floating
                        curls might catch some stray moonbeam, she put her hands upon his hair.</p>
                    <p>Footsteps came nearer and nearer; life or death was in each tread. The
                        terrified voice of David Calderwood was heard avouching that, hours since,
                        the Scottish brothers had fled; and still the only answer was
                        âSearchâsearch!â</p>
                    <p>In their agony, the two young creaturesâthey were both so young!âdrew closer
                        to each other; and Patrick's arms were wrapped round Lettice, as they used
                        to be when she was a child. He whispered, âIf I die, Lettice, love me.
                        Better than lifeâbetter than aught save honour, I have loved
                        <emph>thee</emph>!â</p>
                    <pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7020-149"></pb>
                    <p>She pressed her cold lips upon his forehead, close and fond. This was the
                        only vow which passed between them. The officers began to search the garden,
                        David Calderwood following, wringing his feeble hands. âGood friends, gin ye
                        seek till dawn, ye'll no find ae thing alive, save my puir bairn, if sae be
                        she is living still. LetticeâLettice, whar are ye gane?â cried the old man,
                        piteously.</p>
                    <p>âGo to your fatherâgo!â murmured Patrick; but Lettice was deaf to all love
                        save his now.</p>
                    <p>âI'll help ye to seek in ilka bush and brake, if only to find my puir lassie;
                        and I pray our sovereign lady Queen Elizabethââ</p>
                    <p>âOur sovereign lord King James of England and Scotland; that's the prayer
                        nowâso no treason, old man,â said one of the officers, giving him a buffet
                        which made poor Davie stagger. At the sight, Patrick Ruthven started in his
                        hidingplace.</p>
                    <p>âAn owl in the bushesâHollo there!â shouted the men.</p>
                    <p>Patrick and Lettice scarcely breathed. In her frenzy, she clasped her arms
                        passionately round his neck; her eyes, stretched out into the darkness,
                        flashed fire; she felt that had she only a weapon at hand, she would have
                        committed murder to save him. Vainâvainâall vain!</p>
                    <p>A crash in the bushes, a rough hand on Patrick's breastââHo! prisoners in the
                        King's name!â</p>
                    <p>He was taken at last.</p>
                    <p>Whether she wept, or shrieked, or prayed, whether<pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7020-150"></pb> they took any farewell of one another or no,
                        Lettice never remembered. All that remained in her memory after that awful
                        moment was one sightâa boat gliding down the river in the moonlight; and one
                        sound, words which Patrick had contrived to whisper, âThe Towerâthe
                    Tower!â</p>

                    <head>PART II.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="b">ONE</hi> day, in mid-winter, when Tower Hill, so often reddened
                        with blood, lay white under many inches of snow, a woman might have been
                        seen taking her way over the portcullis into the Tower. She seemed to belong
                        to the middle class; her hood and kirtle were of humble fashion, black and
                        close. She was a small, insignificant-looking woman too, and seemed to be
                        admitted into the awful state prison, or rather to creep in there,
                        attracting from the warders no more notice than a bird flying in at a
                        captive's window, or a little bright-eyed mouse peering at him in the dark.</p>
                    <p>Her errand, she said, was to the governor's lady. Thither she was brought,
                        through gloomy passages that seemed to make her shudder, under narrow-barred
                        silent windows, at which she looked up with a terrified yet eager glance, as
                        if she expected to see appear there the wan face of some wretched prisoner.
                        She reached the governor's apartments. There air and light were not wanting,
                        though it was in the grim old Tower. From it might be seen the shining
                        Thames, with ships<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7020-151"></pb> of all nations gliding
                        by. There were plants, too, growing in the heavy embrasures of one window,
                        and in the other was a group of human flowersâa young mother and her
                        beautiful children.</p>
                    <p>The stranger briefly stated her errand. She had heard that the lady desired
                        an attendant for her daughters, and she came to offer her services, bearing
                        credentials from one whom the governor's wife knew.</p>
                    <p>âThe name is Scottish: are you from our country?â said the graceful mother,
                        her fair face brightening with kindliness.</p>
                    <p>âMy father was Scots, and so were all my nearest relatives,â answered the
                        woman in a low voice, as she pulled her hood closer over her face.</p>
                    <p>âYou say <emph>was</emph> and <emph>were</emph>: are all gone then?â</p>
                    <p>âYes, madam: I am quite alone.â</p>
                    <p>âPoor young thing!â</p>
                    <p>âNay, I am not young; I am thirty-four years old.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd you have never been married?</p>
                    <p>âNo.â</p>
                    <p>âAh!â sighed the happy young wife of twenty-five, with a sort of dignified
                        compassion. But she was of a kindly nature, and she discerned that the
                        stranger wore a lock of great sweetness, and had withal a gentle voiceâthat
                        truest index of a womanly spirit. She enrolled her in her household at once.</p>
                    <p>âAnd you are willing, my goodâ What did you say was your Christian name?â</p>
                    <p>âLettice.â</p>
                    <pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7020-152"></pb>
                    <p>âYou are willing to reside in the Tower? It is at best but a dreary place for
                        us, as well as for the poor prisoners: though, thanks to our merciful King
                        James, we have had but few executions here lately.â</p>
                    <p>Lettice faintly shudderedâperhaps it was to hear such gentle lips speak so
                        indifferently of these horrorsâbut she answered, âI am quite satisfied,
                        madam: even this prison seems a home to one who has just lost the only home
                        she ever knew, and who has now none in the wide world.â</p>
                    <p>She spoke with great simplicity, and in the calm manner of a woman who has
                        been taught patience by long suffering. Nevertheless, when the governor's
                        lady bade her take off her mantle and hood, and the three little maidens,
                        summoned from the inner room, came gathering round her, and, won by her
                        sweet looks, offered childish kisses, Lettice's self-control failed, and a
                        few tears began to fall from her eyes.</p>
                    <p>âNay, take heart, my countrywoman,â said the young matron, kindly: âwe will
                        make you very happy here; and perhaps find you for husband a brave
                        yeoman-warder with a good estate: King James takes care his Scottish
                        subjects shall thrive in merry England.â</p>
                    <p>And quite satisfied that in a wealthy marriage she had thus promised the
                        chief good of life, the lady departed.</p>
                    <p>That night Lettice saw the stars rise and shine, not on the limpid Cam, not
                        on the quaint old garden where her childish feet had played, and where
                        afterwardsâall earlier memories blotted out by those of one terrible<pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7020-153"></pb> nightâshe had walked patiently, bearing
                        the burden of her sorrow for sixteen years.</p>
                    <p>Sixteen years! It was thus long since Patrick Ruthven had disappeared, and
                        yet no tidings had ever been heard of or from him. She had exerted all
                        energies, exhausted all schemesâso far as she dared without endangering her
                        father's safety, or leaving him in his helpless ageâbut could gain no clue
                        as to the after-fate of her lover. Whether he still languished in prison, or
                        had been freed by escape or death, all was mystery: her only certainty was,
                        that he had not perished on the public scaffold, otherwise, she would have
                        known.</p>
                    <p>And so praying for him day and night, and loving him continually, this
                        faithful woman had lived on. The days and years of her youth had glided from
                        her like the waves of a river, uncounted, for no light of love rested on
                        them. Their onward course she neither watched nor feared.</p>
                    <p>She saw the young men and maidens of her own age pass away into the whirl of
                        life, marry, and gather round them a third generation, while she remained
                        the same. Wooers she had, for when sorrow comes in early youth, and fails to
                        crush, it sometimes leaves behind a tender charm beyond all beauty, and this
                        made Lettice not unsought. Some womenâgood women, tooâcan love in their
                        simple, easy-hearted fashion, twice, thrice, many times. Others pour out
                        their whole soul in one love, and have no more left to give ever after.
                        Lettice Calderwood was one of these.</p>
                    <pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7020-154"></pb>
                    <p>Her father lingered many years in great bodily weakness, and in an almost
                        fatuous old age. She tended him unweariedly until he died. Then when she had
                        no kindred tie left in the wide world, no duty to perform, none to love, and
                        none to obey, she formed a resolution over which she had been long brooding
                        with an intensity of persevering will such as few women have, but which no
                        human being ever has <emph>except</emph> a woman.</p>
                    <p>That resolution planned, maturely guided, carried through many hindrances,
                        formidable indeed, but which fell like straws before the might of her great
                        love, Lettice found herself at last an inmate of the Tower. If detained
                        there, as in all human probability he was, unless no longer of this world,
                        she should certainly discover Patrick Ruthven. Farther plans she saw not
                        clear, still doubtful as she was of his very existence. But as she sat by
                        herself in the silent midnight, within a few yards, it might be, of the spot
                        where, if living, he still dragged on his mournful days; or where, if dead,
                        his spirit had parted from his body, there came upon her a conviction which
                        often clings to those whose portion is somewhat like to hers.</p>
                    <p>âHe is not dead,â Lettice murmured, âelse he would have come to me: he knew I
                        should not have feared. No; he is still living; and if living, I will find
                        and save him.â</p>
                    <p>So, praying for her Patrick with the woman's pale, faded lips, as the girl
                        had prayed sixteen years before, Lettice fell asleep.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="âââ"></milestone>
                    <pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7020-155"></pb>
                    <p>It was a dangerous thing for the free inhabitants of the Tower to inquire too
                        closely about the prisoners. The days of Guy Fawkes and Sir Thomas Overbury
                        were not so long past, but that all who had any interest in the enemies of
                        King James, knew it was wisest to keep a silent tongue and close-shut eyes.
                        Lettice Calderwood had dwelt for weeks within the walls where perchance lay
                        her never-forgotten lover, and yet she had neither heard nor spoken the name
                        of Patrick Ruthven.</p>
                    <p>Her whole time was spent with the governor's children. They, happy creatures,
                        played merrily outside the cells wherein was concealed misery and despair.
                        Sometimes they talked about âthe prisonersâ with a light unconsciousness, as
                        if speaking of cattle, or things inanimate. Poor little ones! how could they
                        understand the meaning of the word!</p>
                    <p>âDo you ever see theâthe <emph>prisoners</emph>?â Lettice ventured to ask of
                        them one day.</p>
                    <p>âOh, yes; a few are allowed to walk on the leads, and then we peep at them
                        from below. We are very good friends with one or twoâour father says we
                        may.â</p>
                    <p>âWhat are their names, my child?â If the little girl could have known the
                        strong convulsion that passed over Lettice's heart while she put this simple
                        question!</p>
                    <p>âWe don't call them anything: they are only prisoners. They have been here a
                        great many years, I believe. One lives there, in the Beauchamp Tower:<pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7020-156"></pb> he is always writing; and when we go in
                        to see him, for he likes us to come, he does nothing but puff, puff, puff!â
                        and the laughing child put her finger in her mouth, and began mimicking a
                        smoker to perfection.</p>
                    <p>âMabel,â said the elder sister, âyou should not laugh at him, for our father
                        says he is a good man, and the king is not very angry with him, any more
                        than with the other man who is shut up in the Bell Tower. You should see
                        him, Mrs. Lettice; he is my favourite, because he is so gentle. They say he
                        walks on the leads between his room and the Beauchamp Tower, night after
                        night, watching the stars; and he plays with us children, and gets us to
                        bring him quantities of flowers, out of which he makes such wonderful
                        medicines. He cured Mabel of the chincough, and father of the ague, andââ</p>
                    <p>âHush, Grace; Mistress Lettice is quite tired with your chatter. See how
                        white she looks!â</p>
                    <p>âNo; go on, my darlings; talk as much as you will,â murmured Lettice; and
                        rousing herself, she contrived to learn from them what this prisoner was
                        like.</p>
                    <p>A little, bent manâvery old the children thought, because his hair was quite
                        gray, except a few locks behind that were just the colour of Grace's.
                        Lettice, holding the child on her knee, had often secretly kissed the soft
                        fair curls; she did so now with passionate tenderness. Yet could it indeed
                        be Patrickâso changed! The thing seemed scarcely possible.</p>
                    <pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7020-157"></pb>
                    <p>Next time the children went to see this prisoner, she hid herself, where,
                        from below, she could watch the leads on which he was accustomed to walk.
                        There appeared the figure of a man, moving with the heavy, stooping,
                        lounging gait of long captivity. Could it be that Patrick's youth had been
                        crushed into such a pitiable semblance as this? He came and leaned on the
                        breastwork or boundary of his narrow walk. In the distance the features were
                        indistinct; but something in the wavy falling of the hair reminded her of
                        Patrick. She half uttered a cry of recognition, suppressed it, sank back,
                        and wept. His nameâif she could only learn the captive's name! But there was
                        great mystery kept about that. The children said, âhe had none, he had been
                        in the Tower so many years.â Grace added, that she had once asked him, and
                        he answered, âthat he had almost forgotten it.â Alas, poor soul!</p>
                    <p>One day Lettice, impelled by a wild hope, fastened in Grace's dress a little
                        childish ornament that she herself had used to wear: it had been broken, and
                        the boy Patrick's rude workmanship in the repairing was on it still. If this
                        man were indeed Patrick, it might catch his eye, and bring back to his
                        dulled memory the days of his youth.</p>
                    <p>The âprisonerâ noticed and touched the brooch, Grace said; observed that it
                        was pretty; that he thought he had once seen one like it, he could not tell
                        where; and then his dull mood came over him, and he would not talk any more.</p>
                    <pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7020-158"></pb>
                    <p>Lettice's eager hope sank; but on it she lived yet longer; and day by day she
                        watched tearfully the poor captive, who, if not Patrick, had suffered
                        Patrick's doom.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="âââ"></milestone>
                    <p>The child Grace fell sick. Lettice grieved, for she loved the little girl;
                        but this trouble seemed helping to work out her one great aim of life. Then,
                        at least, she might hear more of the prisoner whose skill in medicine had
                        won the deep gratitude of both the governor and his lady. But Grace
                        improved, and still of the invisible physician nothing was disclosed. At
                        length one night, when the anxious mother and Lettice were watching the
                        child, together and alone, there arose an emergency.</p>
                    <p>âThe potion will be needed at dawn; 'tis near midnight, and I have not sent
                        toâto the Bell Tower,â said the mother. âWhat must be done? Who can I
                        trust?â She looked at Lettice, whom she and all the household had already
                        learned to loveââI will trust you.â</p>
                    <p>She explained briefly that the child's physician was a state prisoner, who
                        had acquired his skill during sixteen years' captivity; that his durance was
                        now greatly softened by the King's order; but that still, except the
                        Governor's family, he was allowed to see no one, nor to hold any
                        communication with the outer world. âAnd,â said the lady, âif I send you to
                            him,<pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7020-159"></pb> you must keep silence on all
                        concerning him, for he and his have been greatly hated by King James and no
                        marvel. He is Patrick, the last of the Ruthvens.â</p>
                    <p>What dizzy, tumultuous joy rushed to the heart of the faithful woman, who,
                        after long-silent years, again heard the music of that name! But she stood
                        still and mute, and gave no sign.</p>
                    <p>âLettice, will you go?â</p>
                    <p>âI will:â and she went.</p>
                    <p>There was not a foot heard, not a breath stirring, in the grim old Tower. As,
                        bearing the ponderous keys, she unfastened door after door, the sound of the
                        opening locks was startling and awful. At the foot of the Bell Tower Lettice
                        paused. Sixteen years seemed all swept away; her heart throbbed, and her
                        pale brow of middle age flushed like a young girl's. Would he know her?
                        Would she not appal him, standing suddenly, like a spectre, by his side? She
                        pulled her hood over her face, and resolved to feign her voice, lest the
                        shock might overpower his strength. Thinking of his emotion, she soon calmed
                        her own, and came with firm step to the outer door. There gleamed a faint
                        ray through some worm-eaten fissure; the governor's wife had told her that
                        he always studied until late in the night. Lettice pictured him as at the
                        old home at Cambridge, as in perpetual youth he dwelt ever in her memory.
                        She saw him, leaning over his books, with his pale boyish features, his fair
                        curls, his dreamy-lidded eyes. She opened the door, and<pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7020-160"></pb> sawâa gray-headed man, withered and bent, quaint
                        and careless in dress, writing by lamp-light. He momentarily raised his
                        head; the face had a strange old world look, mingled with an aspect half
                        vacancy, half abstraction. Lettice shrank aghast. It seemed as if the former
                        Patrick were dead, and this a phantom risen up to mock her. But when he
                        spoke, it was his own true voice.</p>
                    <p>âAh, you come for the child Grace's potion?â said he. â'Tis all prepared;
                        wait a momentâlisten!â</p>
                    <p>He rose, put the medicine into her hand, and proceeded to give various
                        directions concerning it. Then he sat down again, and prepared to resume his
                        reading. Lettice stood silent; that he did not recognise her she plainly
                        saw, yet this was what she had desired. Why should she feel pain?</p>
                    <p>She put back her hood, and approached himââMaster Patrick Ruthven!â</p>
                    <p>He started, but it could only be to hear the long unused Christian name; for
                        looking up at her face, now turned fully on him, <emph>his</emph> expressed
                        blank unconsciousness. He did not know her!</p>
                    <p>âMadam, pardon me; I have not seen you before, but I suppose you come from
                        little Grace. If I have omitted anything, or forgottenâ One forgets
                        everything here.â</p>
                    <p>Lettice groaned.</p>
                    <p>The poor captive looked disturbed, bewildered; restlessly he moved his papers
                        about, and she saw his<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7020-161"></pb> hands, long, white,
                        and woman-like, whose delicacy William used to mock, and Lettice to admire;
                        the same hands she had clasped and kissed in her last frenzied agony of
                        parting. She did so now.</p>
                    <p>âPatrick, Patrick; have you forgotten meâeven me?â</p>
                    <p>He looked at her again, and shook his head. âI have seen you somewhere I
                        think, perhaps in the old time before I came hither; but my memory is poor,
                        very poor. What is your name?â</p>
                    <p>âLettice!â</p>
                    <p>A light came into his face for a moment, and faded. âIt is a sweet name. I
                        used to love it once, I believe; some one I knew bore it; but, as I said, I
                        forget so many things now. Lettice, Lettice!â He repeated the name, as if
                        trying to call back images of a long-past life.</p>
                    <p>Lettice's first horror passed. She discerned all nowâshe saw what he had
                        become: how, shut up from youth to manhood in that fearful prison, his life
                        had withered there; how, as the slow vacant years crawled by, passion,
                        affection, feeling of every kind, had grown dull. Wreck as he wasâthe wreck
                        captivity had made himâher never-dying love encompassed him still.</p>
                    <p>âPatrick,â she said gently, though her tears were flowing fast, âlook at me,
                        and try to think of the pastâmy father, who taught you when you were a boy:
                        and I, Lettice Calderwood, who used to be your play-fellow; the old house at
                        Cambridgeâthe river-bank<pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7020-162"></pb> where you liked
                        to sitâthe garden and the laurel-trees.â</p>
                    <p>His features began to quiver.</p>
                    <p>âIt is dim, very dim; but I think I do remember all this, ay, and you,
                        Lettice! I am glad to see you once more.â</p>
                    <p>He trembled a good deal, and looked at her many times, as though, in
                        comparing his old recollection of her with her present likeness, the
                        difference puzzled him.</p>
                    <p>Lettice said, faintly smiling, âYou know I am old nowâone changes much in
                        sixteen years.â But the smile brought back somewhat of her former self, and
                        Patrick's mind seemed to grow clearer.</p>
                    <p>âI think,â he said, with a mournful simplicity, âI think I must have loved
                        you once. I never forgot you even here, untilââand he shudderedââuntil they
                        put me into that dark, damp cell, where I heard no sound and saw no living
                        face, for I know not how long; I forgot everything then.â</p>
                    <p>Lettice's heart was bursting; she pressed his hands to her breast, and sobbed
                        aloud. At first he seemed troubled by her emotion, and then, as if unable to
                        resist, his own gray hair drooped on Lettice's shoulder, and the poor
                        prisoner also wept. By slow degrees Patrick's memory wakened to the things
                        of the past and of the living world; but they seemed to touch him little. He
                        heard of David Calderwood's death with a quiet sighâall keen sense of human
                        pain being apparently obliterated from his mind. After a pause he<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7020-163"></pb> asked, though still indifferently, âThere was my
                        brother, tooâtell me something of William?â</p>
                    <p>âWilliam acted nobly, and so acting, ceased to be unhappy!â said Lettice, in
                        a confused voice.</p>
                    <p>âUnhappy!â repeated the captive, vacantly. âAh, yes; I had forgotten: we had
                        much sorrow in our youthâhe, and you, and Iââ</p>
                    <p>âHush, Patrick! we will not speak of that. I wrote to William, and told him
                        all: he freed me from my promises. Time brought him comfort: he remained
                        abroad, married, and last yearâgrieve not, Patrick, for while living he had
                        great happinessâlast year he died.â</p>
                    <p>âPoor William dead!âmy last brother dead!â Patrick said, thoughtfully; and
                        sat a long time wistfully gazing in the air, now and then uttering broken
                        words, which showed his mind was recalling incidents of their boyish days.
                        At last he said, âAnd you, Letticeâwhat of yourself?â</p>
                    <p>âI am as you left meâpoor Lettice Calderwood; in nothing changed but years.â
                        She murmured this with her eyes cast down, as if she had need to be ashamed
                        that she had felt a woman's one, pure love; that for it she had given up all
                        sweetness of wifehood and motherhood, and stood there in her faded bloom,
                        speaking no word, but letting her whole life's story speak for her: âSee how
                        faithful I have been to <emph>thee</emph>!â</p>
                    <p>Perhaps, as Patrick looked on her, some sense of the greatness of this love,
                        so strong in its oneness, so<pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7020-164"></pb> patient in
                        its endurance, dawned upon his bewildered and long paralysed senses. He
                        stretched out his arms to her, crying, âI am unworthyâmost unworthy! But,
                        Lettice, love me still: help meâtake care of me: do not leave me again!â</p>
                    <p>He had forgotten, and she too, all worldly things. Waking from that dream,
                        they found that she was only humble Lettice Calderwood, and he a prisoner in
                        the Tower. No matterâone at least had ceased to fear. When a woman once
                        feels that all depends upon the strength of her loveâthat the power to will
                        and to act of necessity lies in her handsâshe gains a courage which nothing
                        can daunt or quell. And as Lettice bade Patrick Ruthven farewell, whispering
                        hope and tenderness which his long-dulled ears would scarcely receive, she
                        felt certain that she should set her beloved free; ay, as certain as though
                        she stood at the head of armies to hurl King James from his throne.</p>

                    <p>Little Grace recovered; and unto the mother's heart, still trembling with its
                        recent joy, another heart was led to open itself, with all its burden of
                        many years. One day, when both their spirits were attuned to confidence,
                        Lettice told the governor's wife her whole story. It was a story that would
                        have melted many a one to sympathy: the young Scottish gentlewoman listened
                        even with tears. Ruthven was her countryman, and she had shown him kindness
                        ever since her husband was made governor; he was her child's preserver, and
                        she <choice>

                        </choice><pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7020-165"></pb> mined to try all efforts to
                        obtain his liberty. She exerted secret influence at Court, at first with
                        hope of success; but that year the bugbear treason was loudly dinned into
                        the pusillanimous monarch's ears, and Tower Hill was again watered with its
                        red rain.</p>
                    <p>One day the little Grace and Mabel loudly lamented that they were forbidden
                        any longer to visit their friend in the Beauchamp Tower. On the next,
                        Lettice and Patrick, walking on the leads (where she had liberty to visit
                        him now), saw the black procession winding past, and heard distantly the
                        heavy sound of the axe's fall. Patrick said, âThere dies a just man and a
                        guiltless, and one that Davie Calderwood would have deeply mourned. God
                        receive the soul of Walter Raleigh!â</p>
                    <p>He spoke calmly, as if such sights had ceased to move him; but Lettice
                        crouched down, hiding her face in inexpressible horror. When they re-entered
                        his narrow prison, she clasped her arms wildly round her betrothedâfor they
                        had plighted their troth to one another, whether it were for life or death.
                        She felt that to have him safe, with freedom to see him, to love and comfert
                        him, was blessedness even here.</p>
                    <p>And so, for a whole year, through fear lest the king's anger should be
                        roused, nothing more was done toward effecting Ruthven's release.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="âââ"></milestone>
                    <p>When once a generous purpose roots itself in a leal Scottish heart,
                        especially a woman's, it is not easy to uproot it thence. The governor's
                        wife came to Lettice<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7020-166"></pb> one day, and told her
                        that there was hope since Queen Anne was dead, and the King could now fear
                        no treason from the Ruthven line. She applied to the Court, and answer came
                        that Patrick Ruthven should be set at liberty, if some near friend would
                        solicit his pardon.</p>
                    <p>âA formâa mere formâonly desired to soothe King James's pride,â said the
                        plain-speaking Scottish lady; she came from the bold race of Kirkaldy of
                        Grange.</p>
                    <p>But, form as it was, when Lettice told her lover the tidings, he shook his
                        head in his listless way, and said it could never be.</p>
                    <p>âI have no friend in the wide world to plead for me, or to crave my pardon;
                        all my kith and kin have died; I am left the last of my race. No, Lettice,
                        it is best as it is! Perchance I would have liked to go once more to the
                        meadows by the Cam where the rare flowers grow; and it would have been a
                        sweet and thankful duty to exercise my skill in healing on the poor and
                        needy. But let beâlet be! Do not talk of worldly liberty; we will go and
                        look at the free, free stars that roam, night after night, over this prison,
                        and never tire! Come, my faithful Letticeâcome!â</p>
                    <p>But Lettice groaned in spirit. He, long used to captivity, scarce felt the
                        chain; she, for his sake, writhed under it like a double weight.</p>
                    <p>âPatrick,â she said, leaning by him, and with him watching the few dull
                        lights that were scattered throughout the black city which lay below, while
                        a yellow mist rising from the river, gathered over everything, palely and
                        coldââMy Patrick, would it not be<pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7020-167"></pb> happy to
                        go far away from here into your own clear northern air? Look!ââand she
                        pointed to the barren osier-flats through which the Thames winds seawardââif
                        instead of that dull line were the mountains you told me of when we were
                        children, rising, height after height, like a good man's life, which grows
                        year by year nearer to heaven, until it melts, cloudlike, into heaven itself
                        at last.â</p>
                    <p>The prisoner sighed, and looked on the blank landscape with glistening eyes
                        that sawânot it, but some dim view beyond.</p>
                    <p>Lettice continued:ââAy, and if we were freeâboth free if we could hide
                        ourselves in some sweet spot, and live our old childlike life!â</p>
                    <p>He answered restlesslyââDo not talk of this, or else I shall die of longing;
                        and I had grown so resigned, so content with my books and my herbs. Why did
                        you bring me back to the bitter world?â</p>
                    <p>âTo save thee, my beloved!â she answered, soothingly. âTo take thee out of
                        prison, and bring thee back the dew of thy youth. Shall it not be so?â</p>
                    <p>âHow can it, when there is no one who has a right to intreat for my pardon? I
                        have no kindred, no tie in the wide world!â</p>
                    <p>âSave one.â</p>
                    <p>âAh, true!âforgive me, my faithful love! But what can <emph>you</emph> do?â</p>
                    <p>Lettice hid her face on his shoulder. If she blushed it was not with shame,
                        for she knew her own pure heart, and Heaven knew it too. She rose, and spoke
                            in<pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7020-168"></pb> a quiet, womanly tone, though
                        somewhat trembling the while.</p>
                    <p>âPatrick, we are neither of us young; all love we bear each other is stilled
                        into the affection that must always exist between two who, having wasted
                        half a life-time in sorrow, hope to spend the poor remainder together and in
                        peace. You will not misjudge what I am going to say?â</p>
                    <p>âNoâno,â answered Ruthven in his absent manner.</p>
                    <p>âThere is but one way to obtain your freedom. Dearest, long-lost and bound,
                        let <emph>your wife</emph> go and plead for you before the king!â</p>

                    <p>The young kinswoman of Kirkaldy of Grange had a rebellious yearning, though
                        she was a governor's lady. She liked to cheat King James of his captives
                        when it could be done with safety. Secretly, in order to avoid all risk to
                        her husband, she introduced a Scottish minister to the dismal chambers of
                        the Bell Tower. There, in that dull prison-house, was celebrated a marriage.
                        Brief it was, and grave; without smiles, without tears. Yet not without
                        love, for they did indeed love one another, those two who, as girl and boy,
                        had clung together so wildly in the garden by the Cam. But their love was
                        not like that of youth: it was deep, solemn, still.</p>
                    <p>When the marriage was performed, Patrick said, in his dreamy wayâ</p>
                    <p>âIs it all done? Am I thy husband, Lettice?â</p>
                    <pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7020-169"></pb>
                    <p>She answered, âYes.â</p>
                    <p>âA hard task for thee to fulfil; a weary life to lead! But art thou content?â</p>
                    <p>She answered, âI am content.â And taking his hand, held it fast in that which
                        would now guide him through life.</p>
                    <p>âNay, have no fear, friends,â cheeringly said the brave Scottish lady who
                        aided them so much. âKing James is feeble-hearted, and he has heard the
                        people's outcry against Raleigh's twelve years' imprisonment, sealed at last
                        with blood. He dare not do the like again. Lettice, take comfort: you will
                        soon have your husband free.â</p>
                    <p>Her <emph>husband</emph>! She heard the wordâshe who had never dreamed of any
                        other life than one of loneliness, over which hung the pale shadow of that
                        early-lost love. Her heart melted under the sense of its great content, and
                        she wept as softly and joyfully as though she had been a young bride.</p>

                    <p>âWill his Majesty appear to-day, my Lord of Buckingham?â said one of the
                        Scottish attendants of the palace at Whitehall, meeting the twin stars of
                        James's courtââSteenie,â and âBaby Charles.â</p>
                    <p>âWherefore, good Ferguson?â</p>
                    <p>âBecause, my lord, there is a person here craving audience, who has been
                        recommended to me by a countrywoman of my own.â</p>
                    <p>âA woman is it? My prince, let us see!â</p>
                    <pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7020-170"></pb>
                    <p>The woman rose up and curtsied beneath the gaze of royalty and nobility; but
                        she had nothing in her to attract or retain either. She was pale,
                        low-statured, and of middle age. âSteenieâ gave her a mock salutation;
                        Prince Charles, ever chivalrous to women, acknowledged her lowly reverence
                        with his dignified, half-melancholy, Stuart smile, and the two youths passed
                        out.</p>
                    <p>âThe king is coming, Mistress Ruthven; now is your time!â whispered young
                        Allan Ferguson.</p>
                    <p>He enteredâthe poor feeble pedant, to whom had dwindled down the ancient line
                        of Scotland's kings. Surrounding him were the great and noble of the day:
                        Gondomar, the gay Spanish ambassador; the Lord-Chancellor Bacon; all the
                        choicest of the English nobility left after the death-sweeping reigns of
                        Mary and Elizabeth; and those of the king's own country whom his
                        conciliatory rule had detached from various factions, to join in fidelity to
                        the one branch of the Stuart family now remaining.</p>
                    <p>âHech, sirs, wha's here?â James cried in his sharp, quavering voice, through
                        which rang the good humour produced by a satisfactory arrangement with
                        Spain, completed that same hour. âPetitioning, my bonnie woman? Aweel, then
                        say your say!â</p>
                    <p>Lettice told her story in words so broken that they would scarce have been
                        understood save for the earnestness of her eyes. It was a story touching and
                        interesting even to James and his frivolous court. To them it sounded new
                        and curious to hear of a woman who had<pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7020-171"></pb>
                        loved and suffered, waited and hoped, and gone through all trial for
                            <emph>one</emph> man's sake, for seventeen years. And it so chanced that
                        their possible mockery of her long maiden life was prevented by Lettice
                        always unconsciously saying âmy husband,â as the governor's wife had charged
                        her to say, instead of mentioning at once the hated name of Ruthven.</p>
                    <p>James looked discomposed. âMy lords, a king maun do as he wills; ye a' ken
                        the chapters in my âBasilicon Doronâ respecting free monarchies, and the
                        right or prerogative of rulers. But I wadna keep an innocent manâmind ye, an
                            <emph>innocent</emph> manâin prison for saxteen-did she no say saxteen
                        years? Woman, wha may ye be? and why dinna ye tell your husband's name?â</p>
                    <p>âIt is a nameâthe bearing of which was the only wrong he ever did your
                        majesty: I am the wife of Patrick Ruthven!â</p>
                    <p>James turned pale, as he ever did at the sound of that dreaded name. He never
                        forgot that it was a Ruthven who acted in that scene of blood which
                        impressed cowardice on the nature of the yet unborn babe: he never forgot
                        the actors in the Gowrie plot, who, for a brief space, caused him, a king by
                        birth and right, to be tied and bound like a felon.</p>
                    <p>He frowned, and looked round on his courtiers, who kept a discreet silence.
                        Then he said with a pedantic air, âWoman, I will hear thee again on this
                        matter,â and passed into the audience-chamber.</p>
                    <p>Lettice's heart grew cold. It was a horrible thing to reflect that life or
                        death lay on the fiat of that poor<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7020-172"></pb> vain,
                        fickle king. No! On the fiat of a King far higher, whose government
                        comprises not kingdoms, but worlds. Kneeling where she had knelt to King
                        James, she knelt to Him, and prayed.</p>
                    <p>There came, crossing the empty chamber, one of the nobles who had formed one
                        of the monarch's train. He was an old man, tall and pale. His demeanour
                        savoured more of the courtly grace of Elizabeth's reign than the foppish
                        gallantry of James's. He announced his name at once.</p>
                    <p>âMistress Ruthven, I am the Earl of Hertford.â</p>
                    <p>She had heard it in the Tower. It had been long chronicled there as a portion
                        of that mournful story of the Lady Catherine Grey, sister to Queen Jane,
                        who, marrying Hertford without Elizabeth's consent, had been imprisoned
                        until her young life's close.</p>
                    <p>He was an old man now, but something in Lettice's story had touched him with
                        the days of his youth. He came to say that he would plead her cause with the
                        king, and that he thought she had good reason to hope.</p>
                    <p>âAnd you have been parted ever since your marriageâseventeen years?â</p>
                    <p>âWe are but newly married, my lord; our bridal was in the Tower,â said
                        Lettice, who never said aught but truth.</p>
                    <p>âAh! no need to tell the king that: yet it makes a sadder tale still. Where
                        abides your husband in the Tower?â</p>
                    <p>âIn the Bell Towerâa narrow, dreary spot.â</p>
                    <pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7020-173"></pb>
                    <p>âI knowâI know!â He turned away, perhaps remembering the poor young mother
                        who had there, in that very Bell Tower, given birth to his two brave sons.
                        He, too, had felt the bitterness of captivity; and as he departed from
                        Lettice, having given her both <choice>

                        </choice> and cheer, she heard the old nobleman muttering to himself,
                        âSeventeen years!âseventeen years!â</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="âââ"></milestone>
                    <p>Patrick Ruthven sat in his tower poring over his wealth of books. An August
                        sunbeam quivering in, rested on a bunch of dried flowers, which the
                        herbalist was examining with great earnestness. He scarce lifted up his head
                        when the light footstep warned him of his wife's entrance.</p>
                    <p>âLettice,â he said, â<foreign xml:lang="grc">eureka</foreign>!â(âI have found
                        it!â) This plant must be the veritable hemlock of the ancientsâthe potion
                        which gave Socrates death. Compare the descriptionâsee.â</p>
                    <p>He looked at her; she was trembling all over with joy.</p>
                    <p>âMy husband,â she said, breathlessly, âleave these books; come and gaze out
                        in the clear morning air; how fresh it is; how freeâfreeâfree!â</p>
                    <p>She repeated the words that the tidings might dawn upon him slowly, not too
                        bewilderingly. She drew him out upon the prison leads, and bade him look
                        northwards, where in the distant uplands beyond Holborn, the ripening
                        wheat-fields shone, wave upon wave, like yellow seas.</p>
                    <p>âThink, Patrick, to go thither; to sit down under<pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7020-174"></pb> the sheaves like little children, as we used to
                        do; to hear the trees rustling, and see the swallows fly; and then to go
                        homeâto a quiet, safe cottage home. Oh, Patrick, my husband, you are free!â</p>
                    <p>âI am free!â He, the prisoner for seventeen years, neither fell down in a
                        swoon of transport, nor wept, nor grew wild with ecstasy. He only uttered
                        the words in a monotonous, incredulous toneââI am free!â His wife embraced
                        him with passionate joy; he kissed her, stroked her yet fair cheekâfairer
                        still since she had once more known peaceâand then went slowly back into his
                        dark room.</p>
                    <p>There he sat motionless, while Lettice busied herself in putting together the
                        books and scientific matters which had gradually accumulated round the
                        captive. Then she brought him attire suitable for a man of middle rank at
                        that period.</p>
                    <p>âYou must not wear this out in the world, my Patrick,â said the wife,
                        touching his threadbare robe of a fashion many years back.</p>
                    <p>âMust I not?â and he contemplated the dress, which seemed to him gaudy and
                        strange. âLettice,â he murmured, âI am afraidâis the world so changed? Must
                        I give up my old ways?â</p>
                    <p>But she soothed him with cheerful words, and made ready for his departure.
                        Ere they quitted the Bell Tower, he went into the little closet which had
                        been his bedchamber, and, kneeling down, thanked God, and prayed for all
                        captives a deliverance like his own. As he rose, there peeped at him a
                        bright-eyed mouse.</p>
                    <pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7020-175"></pb>
                    <p>âPoor fellow-prisoner, whom I have fed so many years, who will feed thee
                        now?â And breaking off some food, he called the little creature to his hand,
                        and gave it its last meal.</p>
                    <p>Then, leaning on his wife's arm, for he trembled, and seemed feeble as a
                        child, Patrick Ruthven left the Tower. He had entered it a youth of
                        nineteen; he quitted it a worn-out, prematurely old man of thirty-six. The
                        prime and glory of manhood had been wasted in that gloomy prison. Thank God,
                        there is no such doom for <emph>innocence</emph> now!</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="âââ"></milestone>
                    <p>Far past what then was London's utmost verge, Lettice Ruthven led her
                        husband. He walked through the streets like one in a dream; all sounds
                        stunnedâall sights bewildered him. If a chance eye noticed his somewhat
                        quaint aspect, he clung to Lettice with terror, lest he should again be
                        taken prisoner. She told him there was no fear, that through Lord Hertford's
                        solicitation and the mediation of Prince Charles, the king had granted him a
                        free pardon; nay, the young prince, ever kind-hearted, had settled on him a
                        pension for life. All this he heard as if he heard it not. Nothing soothed
                        him but Lettice's calm smile.</p>
                    <p>They came to the place which she had chosen as their first abode. It was a
                        farm-house, planted on one of the hills to the north of London. Above was a
                        great wide heath; below numberless little undulating valleys, with trees and
                        meadows, harvest-fields and<pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7020-176"></pb> streams.
                        There, after sunset, they took their evening walk. He, long used to the
                        close air of the prison, shivered even at the warm summer wind; and his
                        feeble limbs, accustomed to pace their narrow round, could scarcely endure
                        fatigue. But Lettice wrapped him warm, and took him to a soft-wooded bank
                        with a stream running below. There he lay, his head on her lap, listening to
                        the ripple of the water.</p>
                    <p>He had never heard that sound since he was a boy sitting beside the Cam, on
                        the night his brother sailed from Harwich. Though his memory was dull yet,
                        and he rarely spoke of the past, perhaps he thought of it now, for the tears
                        crept through his shut eyes, and he whisperedââLettice, you are sure, quite
                        sure, that afterwards William was happy?â</p>
                    <p>She told him again and again that it was indeed so. She did not tell him
                        howâthough William grew renowned abroadâhe never sent for tidings of his
                        imprisoned brother. She would not pain the fraternal love which had kept its
                        faith through life so close and true.</p>
                    <p>âAnd Patrick, are you happy?â</p>
                    <p>He answered âYes!â softly, like a drowsy child. His wife leaned over him, and
                        her hand fell on his hair, once so beautiful, now quite gray. Something of
                        protection was there in her love for him; the mingling of reverence and
                        tender care, due alike to his great mental power and his almost infantile
                        simplicity in worldly thinigs. All he had, she honoured with her whole soul;
                        all he had not, she, possessing, made his own.<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7020-177"></pb> She was a fit wife for him. And so, in this deep
                        content and peace, the sun set upon Patrick Ruthven's last day of
                    captivity.</p>

                    <head>PART III.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="b">A HOUSE</hi>, simple, yet not mean, facing the river-side at
                        Chelsea; its upper storeys fanned by that line of majestic trees which you,
                        reader may still stroll under; and if you are of dreamy mood, I know of no
                        sweeter spot than Cheyne Walk in the moonlight; the river lying silvery and
                        calm; the tall trees rustling among their branches; telling tales of the
                        quaint old mansions they overshadow. But the house of which we were speaking
                        was far humbler than these. Its occupants had chosen it more for the sake of
                        the trees and the river than for any interior show. They lived retired; and
                        when, as now, the master re-entered his own door, he was not met by a troop
                        of domestics, but by one little, old, gentle-looking womanâhis wife.</p>
                    <p>Twenty more years had passed over the head of Lettice Ruthven, yet something
                        of its ancient airiness was in her footstep still; and in her eyes shone the
                        same loving light, for it was kindled at an altar where the fire was never
                        suffered to decay.</p>
                    <p>âYou are late to-night, Patrick?â said she.</p>
                    <p>âAy, I have been all through the meadows at Chiswick, in search of herbs for
                        a poor lad down there who is stricken with ague. I stayed late gathering
                            them,<pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7020-178"></pb> and there came by a couple of
                        Roundheads, who hooted at me for a wizard hunting for charmed plants in the
                        moonlight. Ah, me! do I look such a weird creature, Lettice?â asked the old
                        man in a piteous, humble tone.</p>
                    <p>He certainly had an out-of-the-world aspect, in his long white beard and
                        hair, and his black serge gown, which he wore to indicate his character as
                        physician. And there was a passive gentleness in his voice, which showed how
                        little able he was to assert his own dignity, or to fight his own battles
                        with the hard world. Well for him that neither had been needed; that for
                        twenty years his life had flowed in a quiet stream, he growing continually
                        more absorbed in his favourite studies, and leaving all mundane matters to
                        his faithful helpmate. She did not usually trouble him with any of these
                        latter, but on this day she seemed longing to talk of something else besides
                        the additions he was making to the âMiddlesex Flora,â or the wonderful cures
                        he had wrought with simples until then unknown; or, what he carefully kept
                        to his wife's ears alone, his discoveries in those abstruse and occult
                        sciences, the love of which seemed inherent in the Ruthven blood.</p>
                    <p>âI have found it out,â he said; âthe parchment charm worn by my brother, the
                        Earl John. All these years I have kept it, and never deciphered it until
                        now. It will bring to us and all our children great prosperity.â</p>
                    <p>âAll our children!â repeated Lettice, mournfully. She looked at a corner of
                        the room where hung, each<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7020-179"></pb> in its never
                        changed place, a boy's plumed hat, and beside it a heap of well-worn
                        childish books, mementos of two little sons, who had been sent and taken
                        away, leaving the hearth desolate.</p>
                    <p>âAh, I forgot!â said the other with a light sigh. âBravely did Aleck read his
                        Greek Galen; and as for poor wee Willie, he knew every plant in Battersea
                        Fields. Well might the gossips mock at me, saying, âPhysician, save
                        thyself!â or rather, thy two better selves. But I could not. I am aye good
                        for little, very little.â</p>
                    <p>His wife took his hand affectionately, and said, smiling through her
                        tearsââNay, there is many a one hereabouts who lifts his hat when Dr.
                        Ruthven passes by. If the vulgar mock, the learned honour thee, my husband.
                        And Patrick,â she murmured, with her sweet voice of calm, which hid all
                        sorrow from <emph>him</emph>, âthough our two boys are with God, He has left
                        us our Marie: I saw her to-day.â</p>
                    <p>âDid she come hither?â</p>
                    <p>âNo; she cannot easily leave the Queen's household, you know. But she bade me
                        meet her at a friend's,â and a faint expression of pain crossed the mother's
                        face. âPerhaps she was right; I am scarce fit to mingle with court ladies,
                        as Marie does; and Marie is growing as beautiful and as stately as any of
                        them all.â</p>
                    <p>âIs she?â said Dr. Ruthven, absently. He had never felt the same affection
                        for his daughter as he had done for his two lost sons. Marie had in early
                        youth been separated from her family, and taken under the<pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7020-180"></pb> care of the wife of the lieutenant of the
                        Towerânow become a countess, and in high favour in the Queen's household.
                        Through her means the little girl was afterwards adopted by Henrietta Maria,
                        to be educated at court, and raised to the position due to the last daughter
                        of the direct Ruthven line.</p>
                    <p>âShe had tidings for me, Patrickâtidings that may well make a mothers heart
                        both tremble and rejoice. The Queen wishes to dispose of our daughter in
                        marriage.â</p>
                    <p>Ruthven lifted his eyes, dropped them, and then became intent upon a handful
                        of flowers which he had drawn from the great coarse bag he always carried in
                        his rambles. It was evident he took little interest in the news which had so
                        agitated the mother.</p>
                    <p>âDo you not wish to know who it is that will wed our Marieâay, and at
                        onceâfor all is fixed?â</p>
                    <p>âI hope it may be some good man. Young women usually marryâI am glad she
                        should do so: but you know, Lettice, I am a quiet, dreamy, old philosopher;
                        I have forgotten all such things.â</p>
                    <p>So spoke, after nearly forty years, the boyish lover who had once sat
                        mournfully by the side of the Cam. But this life is an eternal progression.
                        Young, passionate love must of necessity change its forms. Yet what matters
                        that, if its essence remains the same? Lettice, a wife for many years,
                        keeping in her heart still something of its fresh, womanly romance, neither
                        murmured not felt pain that with her husband the noon-day of love had
                        gradually dwindled into evening-tide. And<pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7020-181"></pb>
                        as with her, so should it be with all. Never should a maiden promise her
                        troth, never should a bride stand at the altar, unless she can look calmly
                        forward to the time when all romance melts into reality; when youth and
                        passion cease, and even long-assured affection from its very certainty at
                        times grow tame. Never ought a woman to take the marriage-vow unless she can
                        bear to think fearlessly of the time when she will sit an old wife by her
                        old husband's side, while her only influence over him, her only comfort for
                        herself, lies in the strength of that devotion which, saying not alone in
                        words but in constant deedsââI love thee!â desires and exacts no more.</p>
                    <p>This picture was Lettice Ruthven in her old age.</p>
                    <p>She might have sighed to hear Patrick speak so forgetfully of those things
                        which she with great tenderness remembered stillâfor women cling longer than
                        men to the love-days of their youthâbut she never thought of bringing the
                        brightness of that olden dream to contrast painfully with their calm life
                        now. She passed over her husband's words, and kept silence, musing on her
                        daughter's future.</p>
                    <p>âHe is a rich man, and one of great renowvn, this Sir Anthony Vandyck,â she
                        said at last. âBeing the king's painter, he saw our Marie frequently at
                        court: no wonder he thought her beautiful, or that he should learn to adore
                        her, as she says he does. I wonder if she loves him?â</p>
                    <p>âFret not thyself about that, goodwife, but come and tie up this bundle of
                        herbs for me. There, hang<pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7020-182"></pb> it on the wall,
                        and then sit by me with thy knitting-pins, which I like to watch until I go
                        to sleep. I am so weary, Lettice.â</p>
                    <p>She arranged the cushion under his head: he looked quite old now, far more so
                        than she, though they were nearly equal in years. But he had never recovered
                        the long imprisonment which had dried up all the springs of life. Lettice
                        watched him as he sleptâhis pale, withered face, his thin handsâand her
                        undying tenderness enfolded him yet. Dearly she had cherished her three
                        childrenâthe two dead boys, the daughter now her sole prideâbut this one
                        great love was beyond them all.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="âââ"></milestone>
                    <p>Marie Ruthven was one of the beauties of that court, which, whatever its
                        political errors might have been, was then in its inner circle as brilliant
                        as any which England had known. A monarch generous, accomplished, devoted to
                        the artsâa queen, against whom the greatest crime ever alleged was that she
                        exercised undue influence over her husband by means of the warm attachment
                        which she had inspired and returnedâa royal circle whose domestic purity
                        knew no stainâthese evidences show that, however his political conduct may
                        condemn Charles the king, his domestic life leaves no blot upon the memory
                        of the unfortunate Charles Stuart. Of this court, now gay as if no tempest
                        were near to overthrow it, the chief<pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7020-183"></pb> topic
                        was the marriage of Sir Anthony Vandyck and the Lady Marie Ruthven. The King
                        honoured the bridegroomâthe Queen loved the bride. There were great
                        preparations, banquets, and balls. No one ever thought of the old father and
                        mother dwelling in the little house at Chelsea.</p>
                    <p>But one heart, though sorely stung, yearned over the forgetful daughter. When
                        the beautiful Marie was being attired for her bridal, it was told her that
                        some one wished to see the bride.</p>
                    <p>âA little old woman, dressed like a Puritan, forsooth!â said the gay
                        waiting-maid.</p>
                    <p>And creeping in, dazzled by the splendour of the court-dames, who were
                        grouped around the bridal toilet, the mother came to her only daughter's
                        side.</p>
                    <p>The stately bride uttered no disrespectful disclaimer, for she was a Ruthven;
                        and in ceasing to honour her parents, she would have been disowning her
                        ancient race. But the red flush darkened her brow, and the kiss she gave her
                        mother was forced and cold.</p>
                    <p>âMarie, my child,â murmured Lettice, âwhy did you not tell me your bridal was
                        to-day? I would not have intruded hereâalas! not I. But I would fain have
                        come a little while beforehand to talk with thee, and bless thee, my own, my
                        only child!â</p>
                    <p>Marie looked roundâthe apartment was deserted; she fancied she heard the
                        retreating mockery of her companions and her maids. She said sharplyâ</p>
                    <p>âMother, I meant you no wrong; but the life I lead is so different to yours
                        and my father's: when you<pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7020-184"></pb> gave me up at
                        the Queen's request, it changed all things between us. Therefore, since I
                        knew it would not suit either, I did not invite my parents to my marriage.â</p>
                    <p>âNo, no, of course,â said the poor mother, humbly. She had long looked upon
                        her daughter as quite a different being from herselfâa creature in whom the
                        noble Ruthven race, crushed throughout one hapless generation, was again
                        revived. She scarce could believe that the beautiful, majestic woman she now
                        beheld, was the pining babe whom she had nursed in the hill-cottage, where
                        Patrick after his long captivity had slowly returned to his own right self,
                        so as to be fit for intercourse with the world. Yet something like a sense
                        of pride came over her when she thought that, but for the love of poor
                        Lettice Calderwood, the last of the Ruthvens might have perished in his
                        prison. It seemed enough glory to have been Patrick's delivererâthe mother
                        of Patrick's beautiful child.</p>
                    <p>âAnd is thy bridegroom worthy of thee, my sweet Marie?â asked Lettice. âAbove
                        all, dost thou love him?â</p>
                    <p>âHe is a gay and courteous gentleman,â answered the bride, avoiding the
                        question. âPeople say he is the most renowned artist in Europe: I think him
                        the most graceful courtier, even though he be not very young. He dwells in
                        state at Blackfriars, and he has a country abode at Eltham. Ah, I shall be a
                        great lady as the wife of Sir Anthony Vandyck!â</p>
                    <p>But the question which came from the mother's<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7020-185"></pb> heart, âLovest thou thy husband?â was never answered. Something jarred
                        upon Lettice, as if the nameless division between parent and child were
                        growing wider. How unlike was this courtly bridal to the stolen marriage in
                        the Tower! Yet could she have seen in her daughter's heart some of the
                        emotions which had then touched her own, she would have been more content.</p>
                    <p>âBut,â she murmured, âI was a poor, simple maiden always. From my youth up I
                        never thought of anything but love. It may be different with those reared at
                        court.â</p>
                    <p>She stayed a while longer, until Marie grew restless; and then, with many
                        tears, she embraced the bride, and gave her her blessing.</p>
                    <p>âYour father sends his too, my child,â she continued. âPerhaps we would have
                        been less grieved could we have come, as other parents do, to our daughter's
                        wedding. But her Majesty's desire should ever guide yours; and since the
                        Queen does not will itââ</p>
                    <p>âThe Queen <emph>does</emph> will it,â said a voice behind.</p>
                    <p>There had entered, unobserved, a lady of dignified presence, but yet on whose
                        face was written <emph>woman</emph> in every line. It was Henrietta Maria.</p>
                    <p>âMarie Ruthven,â she said, in gentle reproof, âI meant not to overhear, but I
                        am glad it has chanced so. You should have told me this. Madam,â and she
                        turned to Lettice, âI believed it was of your own will that you and your
                        husband abstained from court. Let<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7020-186"></pb> me now
                        say that I, a wife and mother, would never banish parents from the nuptials
                        of their child. In the King's name and my own, I command both your presence
                        at our solemnities.â</p>
                    <p>Men can make queenships, but the sweetness of true womanhood none can give.
                        Years after, when misery had darkened over the hapless Queen, Lettice
                        remembered the words breathed by her now, in calm contentââ<emph>I, a wife,
                            and a mother</emph>.â Wretched wife!âbroken-hearted mother! humble
                        Lettice Calderwood was happier than she.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="âââ"></milestone>
                    <p>The marriage was to be celebrated in the chapel at Whitehall. There were
                        gathered all the court, gladly following where royalty delighted to honour;
                        as if any honours could add to those which the illustrious bridegroom
                        already woreâthe nobility of genius! As Sir Anthony Vandyck stepped forward
                        in his dignified maturity of fame, it would be hard to say which was most
                        honoured in this friendshipâfor it was indeed suchâthe great artist or the
                        king.</p>
                    <p>âWhat wait we for, my Lord Strafford?â said Charles, as his favourite
                        Minister, Vandyck's chosen friend, advanced, by the Queen's signal, to delay
                        the ceremony a little. Soon after, the courtly circle was joined by two
                        strangers, the father and mother of the bride.</p>
                    <p>Patrick Ruthven had cast off the garb of the poor physician, and appeared as
                        became his noble descent. At his side hung his long-unused sword, preserved
                            by<pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7020-187"></pb> one faithful woman's care ever
                        since the day when the two young brothers had fled to Harwich. In his
                        bearing there seemed to have momentarily revived the ancient dignity of his
                        race; and when he had knelt to kiss the King's offered hand, he arose,
                        lifted his white head, and looked around with a mien well beseeming the last
                        of the Ruthvens.</p>
                    <p>His wife was little noticed and little seen, and she scarcely wished
                        otherwise. It was enough for her to behold her husband resuming his
                        birthrightâher daughter wedded in happiness and honour. Her loving, reverent
                        eyes never turned from these two. Except once, when they rested on the
                        countenance of King Charles, already shadowed with the cares of his
                        troublous reign. She thought of the boyish prince who had passed her by in
                        the audience-chamber at Whitehall; and her memory went back twenty years,
                        dwelling thankfully at last in the resting-place which, as she deemed, her
                        life had now found.</p>
                    <p>The marriage was duly celebrated; Sir Anthony bent graciously for the
                        blessing of his wife's father; and the King, on his departure, smiled so
                        cordially upon Patrick Ruthven, that the courtiers gathered round the poor
                        physician, as though they would fain haste to press under the shadow of
                        another Earl of Gowrie. But the old man's temporary firmness had passed from
                        him; he looked wistfully round for his wife, his only strength.</p>
                    <p>âLet us go home,â he said, wearily; and, so they went home from Whitehall to
                        their peaceful abode at Chelsea.</p>
                    <pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7020-188"></pb>
                    <p>Arrived there, Patrick laid aside his rich mantle and sword with an air of
                        relief. âAh, Lettice!â he said, as the long, cool shadows of the trees fell
                        across the physician's garden, âdear wife, we are happier here!â</p>
                    <p>She might have dreamed loving dreams of his restoration to the honours of his
                        house; but now she saw that that would never be. In him ambition had either
                        never sprung up, or it had been long crushed by calamity. Besides the
                        outward misfortunes of his lot, fate had implanted in him that easy, gentle
                        nature, which had not the power to rise. Born an earl's son, he would die a
                        poor physician.</p>
                    <p>Lettice was pondering over these things when a guest crossed the threshold.
                        It was a friend of many yearsâthe young Scottish lady who had contrived
                        their marriage. She held high station now in the Queen's household, where,
                        through her, Marie Ruthven had at first been brought. She yet visited
                        occasionally the little house on Cheyne Walk. Thither, too, came at times
                        her daughters, both peeresses by marriage, though often old Dr. Ruthven,
                        forgetting himself, called them Grace and Mabel still.</p>
                    <p>âI have a welcome mission to-day,â said the Countess; ânot a formal one, it
                        is true, but one that implies much. It is her Majesty's will that I should
                        ask whether the Master of Ruthvenâshe knows enough of our Scottish usages to
                        give him that titleâwhether the Master of Ruthven was pleased with his
                        reception at court, and whether he would desire in future to be the King's
                        good servant?â</p>
                    <pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7020-189"></pb>
                    <p>âI am so now,â answered Ruthven, simply; âGod knows I never plotted aught
                        against his Majesty or his father, King James.â</p>
                    <p>The lady smiled half-loftily upon the poor old man, who knew so little of
                        worldly, and especially of courtly ways. âYou understand me not, worthy
                        doctor. This message implies that you have only to desire it, and you will
                        be graciously offered, not perhaps your confiscated honours, but a rank
                        equivalent. The King has already planned a peerage wherein to revive your
                        ancient name. What say you, Lettice, will you be Lady Ruthven of Ettrick?â</p>
                    <p>â<emph>Lord</emph> Ruthven of Ettrick!â the wife repeated, unconsciously
                        altering a word. She went up to her husband, and her voice trembled as she
                        said, âPatrick, do you hear? The ancient glory may be restored, my beloved!
                        I may live to see thee in great honour yet: shall it be so?â</p>
                    <p>âWhat?â he said. He had been dreamily watching the swallows skim over the
                        river, and had not heard a syllable of what was passing.</p>
                    <p>Lettice repeated the tidings.</p>
                    <p>He shook his head restlessly: âGood wife, these dreams only weary me. What
                        should I do as Lord Ruthven? Then I could not go out in the fields with my
                        wallet, nor sleep at peace in the chimney-corner. No; I am happier as now.â</p>
                    <p>The Countess became rather indignant. âMistress Ruthven, urge him still; 'tis
                        a mournful and a shameful thing that the last descendant of one of the
                            noblest<pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7020-190"></pb> families in Scotland should
                        waste his life in obscurity. Bid him think of his ancestorsâof the honour of
                        his name. He may yet be Earl of Gowrie.â</p>
                    <p>Patrick Ruthven rose, and something of that dignity which so rarely appeared
                        in him was visible now. âMy Lady Countess, I am already by right Earl of
                        Gowrie, heir to all which that poor title has brought to the Ruthven
                        lineâthe heritage of blood. My father, the first Earl, perished on the
                        scaffold; my brother John, the second, was slaughtered in his own house; my
                        brother William, the third, died forgotten in exile; I am the last. Tell his
                        Majesty I thank him, but I desire no title save that one which I still
                        possess, though I never claim. What matter, since it will cease with me?â As
                        he spoke, his eye caught the memorials of his two sons, and the old man's
                        voice faltered. âTen years ago I might not have answered thusânow, I have
                        nothing more to say.â</p>
                    <p>He rose from his seat at the window, and walked feebly across the room to the
                        apartment set apart for his especial use. There in a few minutes they saw
                        him, his passing emotion having subsided, sitting in his old dreamy way
                        buried among his books.</p>
                    <p>âAre all arguments lost upon him?â said the surprised Countess. âEven you,
                        Lettice, have you for yourself no ambitionâno pride?â</p>
                    <p>âNone,â she answered. âAll I ever had was only for himâand for these.â</p>
                    <p>She looked first at her husband, and then at the mementos of her lost
                        children. Though she spoke sadly,<pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7020-191"></pb> there
                        was great composure in her demeanour; insomuch that the court lady, already
                        somewhat shaken by the first rude breath of the political storm then just
                        beginning to rise, regarded her half-enviously and sighed. Ere departing,
                        however, she tried once more to urge her friend to come to court.</p>
                    <p>âNo,â answered Lettice; âPatrick said rightâhe is happier here; for me, I
                        stay with him always.â</p>
                    <p>So saying, she went back to her husband.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="âââ"></milestone>
                    <p>Lettice Ruthven sat anxiously in her house at Chelsea. She looked
                        considerably older, and, alas! her face wore not the placid content which
                        best becomes old age. It is very sad to see cares creeping on when life's
                        declining energy requires all cherishing. Youth can endureâsometimes can
                        grow strongerâwhile tossed about on life's billows; but old age needs a
                        quiet haven, where the chiefest happiness is <emph>rest</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Many cares had come upon the ancient couple at Cheyne Walk. The awful civil
                        commotions which now shook England to its base had touched even them. Their
                        pension had failed, and that they were in great necessity was plain from the
                        changed appearance of the household. Its little luxuries of furniture were
                        absent, and its bare chambers were swept and ordered by the feeble hand of
                        the mistress alone.</p>
                    <p>When Dr. Ruthven entered, Lettice's own hands were preparing the evening
                        meal. âNay, wife,â he<pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7020-192"></pb> said, restlessly,
                        âcome and sit by me and talk. Leave all else to Marjory.â</p>
                    <p>âMarjory is gone,â answered Mistress Ruthven, smiling. âLettice will be
                        henceforth your serving-woman.â</p>
                    <p>She never wearied him with any domestic troubles; and he, so that he had his
                        simple fare at the customary hour, and the house kept quiet for his evening
                        study, rarely questioned more. He did not now.</p>
                    <p>But after a while Lettice began with a seemingly careless air, yet with
                        evident anxietyâ</p>
                    <p>âPatrick, you have not told me about your day's adventures. Have you found
                        any patients in your wanderings?ââFor the poor physician had been obliged to
                        wander, as a peripatetic herbalist, through London streets, in order to win
                        his daily bread.</p>
                    <p>âPatients? Oh, yes! There was a poor lad at Charing trodden on by one of the
                        Guard's horsesâit took me two hours to make fomentations for him; and there
                        was a beggar-woman, with a child in convulsions; and a sick old gipsy near
                        Battersea. I have expended all my herbs, and must spend two whole days in
                        collecting more.â</p>
                    <p>âBut the money, dear husband,â said Lettice, hesitatingly. âDid any patients
                        give money? You know, alas! we must needs ask for payment now.â</p>
                    <p>âI never askedâI forgot; and I could not sell my herbs to those poor souls.â</p>
                    <p>âNoâno,â answered Lettice Ruthven's kind heart.</p>
                    <p>But she thought sorrowfully of the empty coffers, of<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7020-193"></pb> the fast-coming poverty; not only poverty, but
                        positive want. Against it there was no resource, for Patrick's unworldly
                        ways made him helpless as a child. With a great pang, Lettice had induced
                        him to try this life of a wandering physician; but day by day, when he came
                        in, weary and dispirited, longing for his ancient country rambles, every
                        unconscious complaint of his stung his wife to the heart. Gladly would she
                        even have begged for him, but it was impossible; he would not have suffered
                        it. And besides, humble as she herself was, Lettice never forgot that she
                        was the wife of the Last of the Ruthvens.</p>
                    <p>âHusband,â she said, compelling herself to speak to him on a subject she
                        dreadedââdear husband, you know we are very poor.â</p>
                    <p>âAre we, Lettice?â he answered absently.</p>
                    <p>âI am afraid, if the pension is not paid, our money will not last for many
                        days. Suppose I wereâjust to ask about the pension, you knowâto go again to
                        Marie?â</p>
                    <p>âTo <emph>Lady Vandyck</emph>?â And anger gave a momentary life to the old
                        man's dull eyes. âI thought I told you our Marie was to be henceforth dead.
                        Call her Lady Vandyck only.â</p>
                    <p>âI cannot, PatrickâI cannot! Though she has been ungrateful, and though she
                        does, as it were, shut the door on her poor old mother, still she is our
                        Marie; and she will be kind to us. I pray you, Patrick, let me go!â</p>
                    <p>âNo!â he said. He, otherwise so feeble, was resolute on this one subject
                        only. Therein was compressed his last lingering remnant of prideâthe pride
                        of a man and a father.</p>
                    <pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7020-194"></pb>
                    <p>But in Lettice the strong yearnings of a mother's heart overcame all pride.
                        She tried still to win her husband to consent.</p>
                    <p>âIt is not that I may entreat of our daughter that bounty which we might well
                        claim. No, Patrick; if you desire, I will ask of her nothing. But I long to
                        see her. She is a widow now, and trouble may have changed her heart. She has
                        a childâand not till then does one truly feel what it is to have had a
                        mother. Do you remember how, when little Marie was born, I wept, thinking of
                        my own mother, whom I never saw? Be sure that same Marie will now welcome
                        me.â</p>
                    <p>Ruthven made no answer to these gentle entreaties, but, after a while,
                        relapsed into his usual quiet mood.</p>
                    <p>âI will try again to-morrow,â thought Lettice, as she obeyed his signal, and
                        came to sit beside him while he took his twilight doze. He often did so,
                        holding one of her hands like a child.</p>
                    <p>But on the morrow he left early; and she, spending the day alone in the dull
                        house, could not suppress her yearning to see her daughter. Some hope, too,
                        she had that that daughter's tenderness might be reawakened. And if Lady
                        Vandyck did offer shelter and help to her parents in their old age, from
                        whom might they so well receive it?</p>
                    <p>Lettice arranged her household affairs, examined her remaining store; alas,
                        it was brief work to count the coins! She had thought to walk to
                        Blackfriarsâwhere, in Vandyck's former house, still abode his young widow,
                        left widowed in less than two years<pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7020-195"></pb> from
                        the bridalâbut her strength failed; so she took a boat, and was rowed up the
                        Thames to her destination.</p>
                    <p>Strange was the aspect of London in those times: Westminster without a
                        parliament; Whitehall without a king; the whole city divided against itself.
                        Lettice took little heed of what was passing in the world outside; and as
                        she glided along the half-deserted river, she was bewildered to see, along
                        the streets diverging from the Thames, crowds of excited Roundheads.</p>
                    <p>âDown with the King!â shouted the boatman from his place. âHurrah for the
                        victory of Marston Moor!â</p>
                    <p>And Lettice trembled; for she knew that with the King's fall must sink all
                        her hopes of Patrick's spending his old age in peace and undisturbed by
                        poverty. Landing at Blackfriars she took out her purse. It was one which,
                        some time ago, had come filled with the bounty of the good Queen Henrietta
                        Maria, and on it was worked a royal crown.</p>
                    <p>âHo, hoâhere are Cavaliers!â cried the man, snatching at it. âFair madam, I
                        take this in the name of the State.â With a satirical grimace he poured the
                        few coins left into his pouch, and threw the empty purse to the bottom of
                        the river.</p>
                    <p>Lettice entered her daughter's house, knowing herself to be utterly
                        penniless.</p>
                    <p>It was a wealthy, luxurious abode, for apparently the political convulsions
                        of the time had not touched the peaceful follower of the arts. In its halls
                        still hung many of Sir Anthony's worksâeven some royal portraits. But the
                        one which most charmed Lettice<pb n="193" xml:id="VAB7020-196"></pb> was that of
                        her own beautiful Marieâwhich picture remains to this dayâa token of
                        Vandyck's admiration for his young wife, and a memorial of the wondrous
                        beauty possessed by the last daughter of the Ruthven line. Looking on its
                        sweet features, the mother forgot the cruel neglect which now kept her
                        waiting a full hour in the ante-room of her own child.</p>
                    <p>There passed by a nurse carrying a babe of some twelve months old. At the
                        sight of it, the love which nature causes to revive so strongly towards the
                        third generation, awoke in the aged mother's heart. As yet she had never
                        thought much of her grandchild; but now there came a great longing for this
                        new tie, which might bind up all those that were lost or broken. The nurse
                        was surprised to be stopped by a little old woman, trembling and in tears,
                        who begged to see the child.</p>
                    <p>âGive it to meâinto my own arms: the mother would not forbid,â she said,
                        imploringly. And close to her breast Lettice pressed her daughter's child.
                        âWhat is its name?â was her question, half ashamed, poor soul! that she had
                        to ask it.</p>
                    <p>âJustina. It was given to her the day her father died,â said the Dutch nurse,
                        somewhat pettishly. âIf poor Sir Anthony could see how things are nowââ</p>
                    <p>Further revelations were stopped by a message that Lady Vandyck was now
                        visible. Lettice once more embraced her grandchild, and was ushered into her
                        daughter's presence.</p>
                    <p>Marie was not alone: there lounged about the apartment a young man, who
                        seemed a Puritan proselyte.<pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7020-197"></pb> His sombre
                        dress was jauntily worn, and his demurely-worded speech ran âtrippingly on
                        the tongue.â His close-cropped hair was daintily perfumed, and his
                        embroidered frills bespoke the Roundhead far less than the Cavalier. But
                        Lettice Ruthven saw nought of this: she only saw her daughter. She ran
                        eagerly to meet the gracefully-extended hand of Lady Vandyck, who looked
                        fair and stately in her youthful matronhood.</p>
                    <p>âWilt thou not embrace me, Marie?â said the mother, half-entreatingly.</p>
                    <p>ââHonour thy father and mother, that thy days,ââ &amp;c., &amp;c.,
                        droned out the Puritan gentleman.</p>
                    <p>Marie stooped, and gave her mother one cold, brief kiss. A few formal
                        inquiries she made, ever looking with a sort of timid doubt to her
                        sanctimonious companion, whose approbation seemed to be the rule of all her
                        actions.</p>
                    <p>The mother also regarded him with more than curiosity. âMy child,â she
                        murmured, âI thought to see thee alone; but this young cavalierââ</p>
                    <p>âNay, good madam, give me not that unholy title,â answered the stranger. âI
                        have disowned the pomps and vanities of the world, together with a
                        baronetage two hundred years old. You now behold in me plain John Pryse, the
                        servant of the Lord and of the Parliament: and so, ladies, I will retire.
                        Fairest Marie, a brief adieu.â</p>
                    <p>He kissed the hand of the young widow with an air anything but Puritanical,
                        and vanished.</p>
                    <pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7020-198"></pb>
                    <p>The mother and daughter passed an hour alone. Marie talked gaily of herself
                        and her household; and then, as the time wore on, she seemed to grow wearied
                        and restless. Still Lettice sat and listened, and had not strength to tell
                        what was in her heart. Had it been but to whisper in a loving earââChild,
                        thy mother has need!ââbut to this woman, so stately, so wrapped up in
                        herself, it would be like asking charity. Yet it must be done. Tremblingly
                        she began by telling the story of her stolen purse.</p>
                    <p>âAh, then, you will need some few coins for your journey homeward,â said Lady
                        Vandyck. She summoned an attendant, and, with an air of careless ease,
                        desired him to find and present to âthat ladyâ a small purse of silver
                        pieces.</p>
                    <p>For a moment Lettice's fingers drew back, the coins seemed to burn under her
                        touch; but her motherly heart, finding excuses to the last, whispered that
                        Marie meant kindly, and in manner only erred. So she took the purse. How
                        could her daughter guess that it was the last resource of the aged parents
                        against positive want?</p>
                    <p>Stillâstill the bitter truth remained untold. Marie seemed struggling between
                        discomfort and a sense of duty, when there was heard without Sir John
                        Pryse's heavy footstep and his loud whistle, subdued into a psalm-tune. Lady
                        Vandyck rose.</p>
                    <p>âMarie, dearest, let us have one instant more alone; I have somewhat to say
                        to thee,â cried the poor mother.</p>
                    <p>âSay on then quickly: Sir John might come.â</p>
                    <pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7020-199"></pb>
                    <p>âA word will explain all. It grieves me bitterly, my child, to speak of this;
                        but these troubled times have brought care even upon your father and me. Our
                        pension from the King has ceased.â</p>
                    <p>âWell, mother, I regret it; but what of that? I can offer neither counsel nor
                        influence. Since Sir Anthony's death, I have kept entirely aloof from the
                        court, which will soon have ceased to be a court at all. And if I might
                        advise, speak as little as you can about King Charles; and let the pension
                        rest.â</p>
                    <p>âYou know not all, Marie.â And even the careless daughter was startled to see
                        the bitter expression on Lettice Ruthven's face. âYou consider not that when
                        the pension ceases your father and I must starve.â</p>
                    <p>âStarve, my mother? What a disagreeable word! Pray do not use it.â</p>
                    <p>âIt is the truth.â</p>
                    <p>Some conviction of this seemed forced upon Marie. She rose from her seat, and
                        came beside her mother.</p>
                    <p>âYou do not mean this: it cannot be that you and my father are in want. You
                        know I would never suffer that.â</p>
                    <p>The words were kind, though there was pride in the tone; but Lettice clung to
                        the sweet, and perceived not the bitter. She clasped her daughter's hands
                        and wept.</p>
                    <p>âI knew she would not forsake usâmy only daughterâmy darling! I said so when
                        my husband forbade my coming.â</p>
                    <p>âDid he, indeed? Well, he was always strange, and<pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7020-200"></pb> cared little about me,â answered Lady Vandyck,
                        indifferently. âBut come, mother, we must plan for the future. Of course you
                        both will trust to me for subsistence. The world shall never say that Marie
                        Vandyck left her parents to starve,â she continued, and her beautiful face
                        had in it more of haughtiness than filial sympathy. âPerhaps you might both
                        come and live with me; butâ (here she faintly coloured) âI will consult Sir
                        John Pryse.â</p>
                    <p>âDo not, I pray you. Why should a stranger come between parent and child?
                        Andâforgive me, Marieâbut I cannot like that man.â</p>
                    <p>Marie smiled half-contemptuously.</p>
                    <p>âI grieve to differ with you; but âthat manâ has, by his influence with the
                        Parliament, preserved to me my whole possessions, where the widow of King
                        Charles's favourite might well have lost all. Still more I grieve, seeing
                        that in nine days Sir John Pryse will be my husband.â</p>
                    <p>âThy husband!â echoed Lettice, incredulously.</p>
                    <p>âIt seems to have startled you, mother; yet, nevertheless, it is the fact. My
                        first marriage was of her Majesty's will, my second is of my own. Nay, while
                        you recover from this somewhat unflattering astonishment, I will go seek my
                        betrothed.â And with a proud step, Lady Vandyck quitted the room.</p>
                    <p>She re-entered ere long, leaning on her bridegroom's arm. The mother sat as
                        she had left her, having neither looked up nor stirred. Lettice rose now,
                        however, and scanned with thirsty eagerness the mien and<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7020-201"></pb> countenance of the man who was to be her second
                        son-in-law, and on wvhom her daughter's future peace must rest. Her glance
                        fell, and she sighed.</p>
                    <p>âSir John, I have explained all. Greet my mother Mistress Ruthven,â said Lady
                        Vandyck, in a tone as if she desired to throw the veil of her own dignity
                        round the humble obscurity of her parent. And Sir John Pryse with a valorous
                        condescension, kissed the little withered hand.</p>
                    <p>But Lettice felt that she stood there a stranger on her daughter's hearthâa
                        pensioner on the charity of her daughter's lord. Yet still, though colder
                        and colder sank her heart, she murmured, âIt must and shall be borne, since,
                        husband, it is for thee.â</p>
                    <p>âMy fair Marie has told me,â began the young Roundhead, âthat you, excellent
                        madam, are in want of the good things of this world. Now, by my halidomeâI
                        mean by the ordination of Providenceâfor children to succour their parents
                        is a virtuous and godly deed. Therefore, count on us, madamâcount on us!
                        Have I satisfied my charming bride?â</p>
                    <p>Marie smiled, and he smiled too, with marvellous self-content. And Lettice,
                        her wan cheeks crimsoning, thought how bitter was an old age of dependence.</p>
                    <p>âOur plan, Mistress Ruthven, is this. Shall I explain it, Marie?â She
                        acquiesced. âThat you should abide with your daughter, or at least in her
                        household. Such an easy life may best suit your years, and you can take care
                        of your grandchild. Do you consent?â</p>
                    <pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7020-202"></pb>
                    <p>âI know not. My husband loves quiet and freedom: he might not choose to dwell
                        in this great house.â</p>
                    <p>âWhich he will never be required to enter. Madam, the offer was meant for
                        yourself alone. John Pryse, the servant of the Parliament, could not venture
                        to endanger his safety by harbouring a Royalist, a pensioner and follower of
                        Charles Stuart.â</p>
                    <p>Lettice was dumb with amazement.</p>
                    <p>âIt is said,â continued the bridegroom elect, âthat Dr. Ruthven has long
                        dealt in unholy charms and spells, which are blasphemous, and not to be
                        allowed. Therefore, ere farther harm come to him, let him retire to some
                        country village, where I will see that he shall not need.â</p>
                    <p>Having delivered himself of all this generosity, Sir John Pryse lounged to
                        the window, and gazed out listlessly on the Thames.</p>
                    <p>Lettice paused, breathed hard, and then rushed up to her daughter.</p>
                    <p>âMarie, say this is not true, or that you have not desired it!â</p>
                    <p>âWhat! Is there anything so marvellously wicked in this plan? I thought it
                        for your good. You must have trouble enough with my old father, if what I
                        have heard be true. Well, mother, why do you look so strange?â</p>
                    <p>âGo on!â</p>
                    <p>âI have little else to say,â answered the lady, carelessly. âSir John knows
                        best; I abide by his decision. As to the danger he would run, he is <choice>
                            <orig>cer-</orig>
                            <reg>certainly</reg>
                        </choice><pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7020-203"></pb> tainly right in that; and you
                        know I could not give up a husband for the sake of a father.â</p>
                    <p>âYet you would have me give up <emph>my</emph> husbandâand for whom? Not for
                        my daughter. Alas! I have no daughter,â moaned the aged mother, struck with
                        a grief worse than that of the childless. Suddenly she roused herself, and
                        came up to Marie. With a fixed sorrow, far deeper than when she looked on
                        her two dead sons, she gazed into the beautiful face of the living lost.</p>
                    <p>âMarie, you have been a wife, you are a mother; hear now a tale you never
                        wholly heard before. There was once a girl who learned to love with her
                        whole soul one who was brought up with her from a child. They were parted.
                        For sixteen years, she never saw or heard of him, yet she loved on. She
                        sought him out through all his miseries; Heaven helped her, and gave her
                        power to save him. They were weddedâ'twas not like your gay bridal, for it
                        was in a prison. He was somewhat changedâgrown old before his time, perhaps
                        a little feeble and wayward. But she kept the troth of her youth and her
                        marriage vow. She has âloved, honoured, and cherished himâ for nearly thirty
                        years. She will do so until the end.â</p>
                    <p>As Lettice spoke, the dignity of this great love, which had been the soul and
                        centre of her life, seemed to encompass her round, so that even the haughty
                        daughter quailed before it.</p>
                    <p>âI said nought to pain you, mother; I know you have been a good wife to my
                        father. But for any<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7020-204"></pb> other plan than this
                        of Sir John's, it cannot be. Let us talk no more on the matter,â she added,
                        coldly, playing with her jewelled rings, and glancing less with affection
                        than with the coquettish jealousy of wooing days to where her future lord
                        was idly amusing himself.</p>
                    <p>Lettice pressed her hand upon her heart, where the last pulses of a mother's
                        loveâso long crushed, so keenly woundedâwere ebbing into eternal silence.
                        Then she said, speaking slowly and very calm, âYears ago, when I was past my
                        youth, when I had thought to go childless to my grave, God sent me a
                        daughter. We were poor then. I often toiled all day, and lay awake at night
                        nursing my sickly babe. But I smiled, and said she would repay it all to my
                        old ageââ</p>
                    <p>âMother, I cannot endure romance, but I wish to do all that I believe is my
                        duty to do. As for affectionâyou know, parted as I was from you in my very
                        childhoodââ</p>
                    <p>âAy, there is the grief again! I said to myself, âWhat am I, simple Lettice
                        Calderwood, to rear a daughter of the noble Ruthven line?â So I crushed my
                        heart down, and gave up my darling. I wish now that I had then given her
                        unto God, that she might be lying at peace in the grave, with her two
                        brothers, rather than I should live to look on her as I look this day, and
                            sayââ<emph>I have no child</emph>.ââ</p>
                    <p>Sir John approached. âYour mother seems excited, sweet Marie. Surely her mind
                        wanders?â And he smiled. Marie exchanged glances with him, and smiled<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7020-205"></pb> too. There was neither anger nor pain on
                        her brow; smooth and polished it was as marble, an emblem of her own nature.</p>
                    <p>Lettice regarded her beautiful daughter once more with that long, long gaze
                        which one gives, knowing it to be the last; and then she turned to the door.
                        Lady Vandyck followed her with graceful courtesy.</p>
                    <p>âYou will depart thus, mother? At least let me aid you in some way.â</p>
                    <p>There was no answer.</p>
                    <p>âDo not let the world, or even Sir John, suppose there is bitterness between
                        parent and child. Give me your hand, mother.â</p>
                    <p>Lettice gave it. There was a light, cold pressure, and it fell. The lady went
                        back to her lover; the mother passed out, walking slowly, like one whose
                        eyes are bound. Once, twice, she paused and looked back, as if she heard
                        herself called. But it was only the light echo of a laugh, the same as the
                        little Marie had once laughed beside her mother's knee. Lettice closed her
                        ears, and, half-staggering as she moved, passed out of the house to the
                        river side.</p>
                    <p>Gliding, gliding down the quiet Thames, it seemed as if her whole life passed
                        by her like a vision: the merry childhood; the long years of melancholy
                        maidenhood, sad vigil to a brief day of joy; the time of full content, when
                        the house rang with children's voices, and the future almost blotted out the
                        dreary past; last of all, the still, but not sorrowful old age, when they
                        two were left alone, husband and wife, waiting calmly<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7020-206"></pb> for the next great changeâthe only one that, as
                        it seemed, could come. It was a life which contained much sorrow, as all
                        human lives must; but it had been full of love. No woman would look back
                        upon it and grieve.</p>
                    <p>Lettice Ruthven entered her own house, and sat long in meditation. Then she
                        rose up as usual, and made ready for her husband's return. He came up
                        wearied out; but he poured into her lap, with an almost childish pride, a
                        handful of silver, his fees as a wandering physician. When he was not
                        observing her, Lettice took one of the coins, replaced it in lieu of that
                        she had taken from her daughter's gift, and put Marie's purse aside, to be
                        touched no more. Then she came to her husband, and her aged arms embraced
                        his neck as she murmured, âNow I have no one but thee, no one but thee!â</p>

                    <head>PART IV.</head>
                    <p>â<hi>I have been young, and now am old, yet never saw I the righteous
                            forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread</hi>.â</p>
                    <p>This is the experience of good men, and of wise observers of life throughout
                        all time.</p>
                    <p>Patrick Ruthven and his wife were not âforsaken.â True, they were very
                        poorâsometimes even positive need stood at their cottage-door, but it never
                        entered. Some invisible hand always came between, and the<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7020-207"></pb> spectre passed. They lived in great peace; for
                        Patrick, growing feebler and more dreamy year by year, had few wants, few
                        desires. To sit in the sun, or stroll about the meadows at Battersea, where
                        their cottage was, now and then wandering on towards Londonâthus passed his
                        quiet existence. Sometimes he gained a little money as a physician; at other
                        times their dependence was on gifts brought by the Scottish lady who had
                        contrived their marriage in the Tower, and whose husband had readily changed
                        sides, and gone over to the Commonwealth. She, with her daughters, Grace and
                        Mabel, sometimnes visited them. But the old man and his wife were as it were
                        childless: Marie, lady of Sir John Pryse, never crossed their threshold.</p>
                    <p>One day, when the January twilight was fast closing in, Lettice sat waiting
                        for her husband. He had been absent since morning, having journeyed to
                        London with a young boy whose life he had once saved in a fever, and who
                        oftentimes faithfully guarded the old physician's failing steps. Lettice
                        waited and waited, until it grew dark. The slow pulse of age is not easily
                        stirred with the quick fears of youth. Yet she was growing alarmed, when she
                        heard a well-known step, and Patrick Ruthven tottered in.</p>
                    <p>âMy husband, what is this?â cried Lettice, for his aspect was wild and
                        disordered. He trembled violently, and kept continually his hand before his
                        eyes. At last he slowly removed it, and looked fearfully around.</p>
                    <p>âI think I shall not see it here; I have seen it all the way homeâthe axe,
                        the blockâeven the snow on<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7020-208"></pb> the hedge-side
                        seemed dyed with blood! Oh, Lettice, Lettice, it was horrible!â</p>
                    <p>She, in her seclusion, knew nothing of what had happened on that fatal day,
                        which she had spent calmly sitting in her quiet cottageâthe 30th of January
                        1649. She thought her husband's mind was wandering, as it well might, to the
                        horrors of his youth and middle age. She tried to soothe him, but in vain.
                        Some great shock had evidently overwhelmed the old man's feeble powers. As
                        he sat in his arm-chair, shudder after shudder came over him. Often he
                        clutched his wife's hand convulsively, or muttered broken exclamations. At
                        last he said, speaking somewhat more connectedly, âI will tell thee all,
                        Lettice. This day I went to London; the streets were crowded with people,
                        thronging, as it seemed, to some great sight. I asked a soldier if it were
                        so. He laughed, and said there was indeed at Whitehall a rare showâa royal
                        show. I thought it was the King restored, so I said with gladness, âGod
                        bless King Charles!â Then the soldier smote me down. Look, Lettice!â</p>
                    <p>He held up his bruised arm, and his wife turned pale. âNay, it is nothing;
                        for the people rescued me soon, and one man cried, âWe shall have blood
                        enough on our heads this day.â So the crowd bore me on with them till we
                        came to Whitehall.â</p>
                    <p>Lettice ever changed countenance at that word, which brought back the great
                        crisis in her life, when she came to the palace to plead for her
                            husband's<pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7020-209"></pb> freedom. She said anxiously,
                        âAnd what didst thou see there, Patrick?â</p>
                    <p>âA black scaffold, an axe, a blockâsights I knew well!â he answered,
                        shuddering.</p>
                    <p>His wife came closer to him, but could not calm his rising agitation.</p>
                    <p>âYes,â he cried, âit was indeed a royal showâit was the murder of a king!â</p>
                    <p>Lettice cried out, âHave they done it then? Alas! for the good kingâthe
                        gentle king! He it was who gave me back my husbandâthe noble Prince
                        Charles.â</p>
                    <p>Patrick continued, unheeding:</p>
                    <p>âHe came forth, stepping from his own palace-window to the scaffold. When he
                        appeared women shrieked, even men wept. For me, the strength of my youth
                        seemed restored; I lifted my voice in the crowdââI am Patrick Ruthven! The
                        King's father sent my father to the block, slew my two brothers, imprisoned
                        me for seventeen years; yet would I not take life for life. God defend King
                        Charles!â But the people crushed round, and silenced me. There was an awful
                        hush; then I saw the axe shiningâsaw it fall.â</p>
                    <p>The old man gasped, shivered, and was seized with a convulsion. All night he
                        raved of things long past, of the scenes of blood which had marked his
                        childhood, of those he had witnessed in the Tower. Towards morning these
                        paroxysms ceased, and with ebbing strength there came over him a great calm.
                        He tried to rise, and walked, with Lettice's help, to their fireside. But<pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7020-210"></pb> he staggered as he moved, and sinking in
                        his arm-chair, said piteously, âI am so wearyâso weary!â then fell into a
                        quiet slumber.</p>
                    <p>While he slept, there entered the Scottish countess. She was attired in
                        black, her countenance full of grief and horror. She came hastily to say she
                        was going abroad, to join her unhappy mistress. Her heart seemed bursting
                        with its load of indignant sorrow.</p>
                    <p>âLook you,â cried she, âI never loved the Stuart line: I believe that,
                            <emph>as</emph> a king, the King erred; but I would have given my right
                        hand to save the life of Charles Stuart. And I wish that I may yet see this
                        vile England flow with blood, to atone for his which rests upon it this day!
                        But, Lettice, you are calmâthese horrors touch not you!â</p>
                    <p>And then mournfully Lettice told of what had befallen her husband.</p>
                    <p>The lady stepped quickly and noiselessly to look at Dr. Ruthven. He still
                        slept, but over his face had come a great change. The temples had fallen in,
                        there were dark lines round the eyes; yet over all was a sweetness and peace
                        like that of childhood. Lettice almost thought she saw in him the image of
                        the boy Patrick, her playfellow by the Cam. She said so to her friend, who
                        answered nothing, but stood steadfastly gazing a long time. Then she took
                        Lettice's hand, and looked at her solemnly, even with tears.</p>
                    <p>âI shall come back here to-morrow, Lettice; my journey can be deferred a
                        day,â she muttered, and departed.</p>
                    <pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7020-211"></pb>
                    <p>Lettice Ruthven went to her husband's side, and watched him until he awoke.
                        It was with a quiet smile. âWhat think you, dear wife? I have been dreaming
                        of the old time at Cambridge. How long is that ago?â She counted, and told
                        him, more than fifty years. âIt seems like a day. How happy we were,
                        Letticeâyou, and William, and I! How we used to sit by the river-side on
                        summer nights, and play by moonlight among the laurels! I think, when I gain
                        strength enough, we will go and see the old place once more.â</p>
                    <p>So he tallked at intervals, all day referring to incidents which had vanished
                        even from Lettice's memory. For thirty years he had not spoken of these
                        things; and Lettice, while she listened, felt a vague awe stealing over her.
                        Something she remembered to have heard, that at life's close the mind often
                        recurs vividly to childhood, while all the intermediate time grows dim.
                        Could it be so now?</p>
                    <p>At night Patrick did not seem inclined for rest. He said he would rather stay
                        in his arm-chair by the fireside. There, sometimes talking, sometimes
                        falling into slumber, the old man lay, his wife watching over him
                        continually. Gradually the truth dawned upon herâthat on the path they had
                        long trodden together <emph>his</emph> step would be the soonest to fail. To
                        the eternal land, now so near unto both, he would be the first to depart.</p>
                    <p>âIt is well!â she murmured, thinking not of herself, but only of his
                        helplessnessâas a mother thinks of a child whom she would fain place in a
                        safe home rather than leave in the bitter world alone. âAll is best<pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7020-212"></pb> thus. It is but for a little while.â And
                        she ceased not to comfort herself with these wordsââA little whileâA little
                        while!â</p>
                    <p>When Patrick woke his mind had begun to wander. He fancied himself in the old
                        house at Cambridge; he talked to his aged wife as if she were the girl
                        Lettice, whom he had loved. More especially, he seemed to live over again
                        the night when he was taken prisoner.</p>
                    <p>âI will hide here, but I will not see LetticeâWilliam's Lettice! I could not
                        take away Lettice and break poor William's heart. If I suffer, no one shall
                        know. Hark, how the laurels are shaking! We must keep close. I clasp thee,
                        loveâI clasp thee! Why should I fear?â</p>
                    <p>Thus he continued to talk, but gradually more incoherently, until, just
                        before dawn, he again slept. It was a winter's morning, pale but clear.
                        There was something heavenly in the whiteness of the snow; Lettice, looking
                        at it, thought of the shining robesâwhite âsuch as no fuller on earth can
                        whiten themââwith which those who have gone through much tribulation shall
                        be clothed upon, one day. That day seemed nearâvery near, now.</p>
                    <p>She heard her husband call her. He had awakened once more, and in his right
                        mind.</p>
                    <p>âIs it morning?â he asked, faintly. âI feel so strangely weak to-day.
                        Lettice, take care of me.â</p>
                    <p>She came to him, and laid his head on her breast.</p>
                    <p>Patrick looked up, and smiled. âDear wife, my<pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7020-213"></pb> comforter and sustainer! I have been happy all my lifeâI am happy now.â</p>
                    <p>He closed his eyes, and his features sank into an expression of perfect rest.
                        Once or twice he murmured his wife's name, those of his two boys, and
                        anotherâunuttered for yearsâthe name of <emph>Marie</emph>. Then, and not
                        till then, the cruelly-forsaken mother wept.</p>
                    <p>The old man's breathing grew fainterâthe solemn hour was nigh. He said,
                        softly, âLettice, pray!â She knelt beside him, still holding his hands, and
                        prayed. When she arose, his soul was just departing. He whispered, smiling,
                        âCome soon!â And Lettice answered, âYes, loveâyes!â It was all the farewell
                        needed for a parting so peaceful and so brief.</p>
                    <p>Thus Patrick Ruthven died.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="âââ"></milestone>
                    <p>âYou will come abroad with me, my poor Lettice,â said the Scottish lady,
                        affectionately. But Lettice refused, saying it was not worth while changing
                        her way of life for such a little time.</p>
                    <p>âAlas, a mournful life has yours been! It is always the good who suffer!â
                        bitterly said the lady. âHow strange appear the inequalities of this world!â</p>
                    <p>Lettice Ruthven lifted her aged face, solemn yet serene. âNot so! I loved, I
                        have spent my whole life for him I loved; I have been very happy, and I
                        thank God for all.â These were the only words that she would say.</p>
                    <pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7020-214"></pb>
                    <p>Patrick Ruthven and his wife have long been forgotten; even their very
                        burial-place is unknown. But I think there lives not one true heart that, in
                        pondering over their history, would not say, âThese two were not unhappy,
                        for they feared God, and loved one another.â</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">HERMAN WALDHOF</hi> was indulging in a love-reverie. He sat,
                        leaning his chin upon his hand, in an easy, careless, <foreign xml:lang="ita">dolce far niente</foreign> attitude, before a large
                        mirror.</p>
                    <p>His eyes were earnestly fixed, Narcissus-like, upon himself imaged therein.</p>
                    <p>Many said that young Herman Waldhof was the handsomest man in Leipzic, and
                        Herman himself was scarcely disposed to deny the fact. It had been forced
                        upon his notice so often during the last five-and-twenty years, that at
                        length he took it for granted. Yet he was too high-minded to be very vain.
                        He bore his honours as a monarch does his crown, conscious of the dignity
                        which Fortune has bestowed, and therefore taking no pains to assert what
                        must be obvious to all. But in the earnest look which Herman directed
                        towards his mirror there was a deeper feeling than<pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7020-216"></pb> mere vanity. He loved; he hoped, yet hardly
                        believed, that he was beloved again; and in the reflected features opposite
                        to him might be read a look of doubt and anxious inquiry.</p>
                    <p>When one loves, how quickly does this feeling come! how does the mirror,
                        which was before hardly noticed, or made only the resort of idle vanity,
                        become like an adviserâa friend! We wish to see ourselves with the eyes of
                        the beloved. We wish to know, without flattery, what we really are. We gaze
                        with a feeling of lingering fondness, in which vanity has no share, on those
                        features which we would fain believe are fair and precious in another's
                        sight. Ah, thence proceeds all their charm in our own! Thus, as the young
                        lover tossed back the dark clustering curls, looked wistfully into the
                        depths of the large eyes, and noted the graceful curves of the beautiful
                        mouth, trying to criticise the well-known face which met his view with the
                        indifference of a perfect strangerâhis heart was full, not of himself, but
                        of <emph>her</emph>.</p>
                    <p>A knock at the door made the young man instinctively turn his back to the
                        mirror and take up a book, but he could not keep down the colour that
                            <emph>would</emph> rise to his very forehead, at being discovered in the
                        unmanly act of examining himself in the glass. Even though the discoverer
                        was his friend and companion from boyhood, Leuthold Auerbach.</p>
                    <p>âAre you studying, or only dreaming, Herman?â said the newcomer, in those
                        sweet, low tones, so rarely heard in a man's voice, which are always the
                        index of<pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7020-217"></pb> an eminently sensitive and gifted
                        mind, which attract in a moment, and are the dearest heart-music in the
                        world.</p>
                    <p>Herman answered the question with a faint laugh,â</p>
                    <p>âDoing both, I believe. But, I have a charge against thee, good friend, and
                        from a fair one to whom thou wouldst not willingly give cause of anger. I
                        was last night at the old professor's, and the Lady Hildaââthe young man's
                        colour deepened a little as he uttered the nameââHilda asked why thou wert
                        not there too.â</p>
                    <p>âDid she so?â Leuthold said.</p>
                    <p>Herman was too much engrossed by his own feelings, or he would have seen the
                        sudden paleness, the quivering lip, the involuntary clench of the hands,
                        that his words brought to Leuthold. Alas! he, too, loved; but love to him
                        was no joy, only hopeless pain.</p>
                    <p>âWhat shall I say in thy defence, false knight, when I see her to-morrow?â
                        Herman continued.</p>
                    <p>âAgain!â muttered Leuthold.</p>
                    <p>There was a sore pang at his heart, but he repressed it, and said, calmly,â</p>
                    <p>âThe Lady Hilda is ever kind; she always was, since the days when I was a
                        poor student in her father's house. Tell her I was ill, or I would have
                        come.â</p>
                    <p>âThou art not well now, poor friend!â said Herman, turning round, and laying
                        his hand on his friend's shoulder. âPale as everâno, now thou art crimson!
                        Why, Leuthold, thou hast been studying far too much.â</p>
                    <pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7020-218"></pb>
                    <p>âIt may be; a student must do so if he would attain his end. I am not like
                        thee, Herman,âyoung, rich, handsome.â</p>
                    <p>âThou art quite as young,â interrupted the other, âthough thou dost not look
                        so; and as rich, for thou hast enough for thy wants, which is more than I
                        often have for mine, I candidly confess. As to being handsomeâ But, pshaw!
                        what nonsense is this! I am so anxious, so full of thought, I cannot jest
                        any more. Leuthold, thou shouldst pity me!â</p>
                    <p>âPity <emph>thee</emph>!â said the student. âTheeâthe pride of Leipzic,
                        admired by all, loved byââ</p>
                    <p>âOh, Leuthold, I know not that Hilda loves me! Last night I thought her so
                        cold, and there sat beside her that young Graf von Pâ, and she listened to
                        him; she spoke fondlyââ</p>
                    <p>âI do not believe it,â gravely answered Leuthold. âHilda is too sincere, too
                        pure-hearted, to sport with any one's feelings thus.â</p>
                    <p>The lover clung eagerly to the willing belief.</p>
                    <p>âAh, well, I might be wrong, but love is full of vagaries,âmy whole soul is
                        wrapped up in her! Tell me, Leuthold, thou who hast known her heart from
                        childhood, whom she regards as a brother, am I such an one as Hilda would
                        love?â</p>
                    <p>And Herman looked fixedly at his friend, to whom each unconscious word came
                        like a barbed arrow. Yet not a muscle of Leuthold's face quivered beneath
                        the gaze; he grew strong through the intensity of the love which had made of
                        his heart not a home to abide<pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7020-219"></pb> in, but a
                        tomb wherein it must be buried for evermore. It gave no outward sign, no
                        more than the poor clay resting under a green grave.</p>
                    <p>âThou askest more than I can answer, dear Herman,â said Leuthold. âBut think
                        what thou art!â</p>
                    <p>âOh, that I could see myself!â cried the impetuous young man. âOh, that I
                        could see myself as any other manâhow I look, how I speak, how I act! Do you
                        know what I was so mad as to be doing but now?â he added, colouring deeply.
                        âPlaying pranks before the mirror, and trying to judge of my own face as I
                        would that of the fool Von Pâ, or any stranger! Oh, if I could see myself as
                        I really am,âmost of all as I appear in Hilda's eyes! Is there no spell, no
                        magic, that will give me my desire? Surely, Leuthold, thou who hast studied
                        the deep secrets of alchemy, who hast beheld the great Helvetius face to
                        face, must know something!â</p>
                    <p>âSpeak not of these things,â answered the student, solemnly. âTo those who
                        live in the world, in its gay realities, the inner world of mystery is not
                        open. Yet if it were as thou sayest,âif we could gain this knowledgeâI, too,
                        would desire it equally. And it may be so,â continued Leuthold, with wild
                        and kindling eyes; âwho knows! The more I study, the more I see that wisdom
                        is unfathomable.â</p>
                    <p>He rose up and paced the room with an energy that made his slight figure
                        dilate, until it seemed in the twilight to grow to a giant's size. Deeper
                        and deeper gathered the shadows in the large, lofty room: it was<pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7020-220"></pb> a noble hall, which the wealth of Herman Waldhof
                        had gained from its old baronial owners, whose ancestors seemed to frown
                        from the walls upon the new possessor. The twilight faded, and all became
                        wrapped in gloom. Herman watched the dim figure of Leuthold as he moved
                        backwards and forwards, utterly unconscious of his friend's presence;
                        sometimes murmuring, in a sort of monotonous chant, rhymes in a strange
                        tongue, and then again maintaining a total silence. At last Herman, in the
                        darkness, could only hear his footsteps resounding at measured intervals on
                        the oaken floor.</p>
                    <p>All this time the young man never moved. Gay-hearted as he seemed, Herman was
                        deeply tinctured with the belief in supernatural things, which was called
                        forth by the mysterious acts and words of many wise men of the middle ages.
                        On his friend Leuthold, whom he knew to be deeply read in the lore of the
                        cabalists and alchemists, he ever looked with most reverent awe.</p>
                    <p>At last a touch on his arm made Herman start, and the student's voiceâbut so
                        low and changed, that it seemed almost unearthlyâfell on his ear:â</p>
                    <p>âIt will be accomplished; wait and see: they are coming!â whispered Leuthold.</p>
                    <p>Overpowered with terror, Herman would have fled, but his friend held him with
                        a grasp that seemed like that of an iron band.</p>
                    <p>âWeak man, wouldst thou shrink?â sternly cried the student.</p>
                    <pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7020-221"></pb>
                    <p>âI shrink from meeting those thou hast called upâthe fiendsâthe demons!â</p>
                    <p>âThey are no demons, they are good spirits. Know, Herman, that each man born
                        into the world has a guardian angel given him, which must attend him from
                        birth until death. To the common herd of mankind, who eat and sleep, toil
                        and rest, marry and die, without a thought beyond the petty round of daily
                        life, this spirit is no more than an inward voice, the voice of conscience.
                        But to those on whom God has bestowed His glorious gift of geniusâa spark of
                        His own divine essenceâthe angel of their being is far nearer; a presence
                        that may be felt. The more they cultivate this inner sense, the stronger it
                        becomes, until they see with the open eyes of the soul, and hear with its
                        angel-ears.</p>
                    <p>âI, even I,â continued Leuthold, while his voice rung through the gloom like
                        the voice of an unseen spiritââI, even I, in my poverty, in my loneliness,
                        in my despair, have seen my Angel standing beside me, whispering comfort and
                        wisdom and joy, such as no earthly sorrows could take away. And now, by the
                        power of my will and my faith, I have again brought this celestial guardian;
                        and not only mine, but thine! Listen, they are coming!â</p>
                    <p>âAnd I!â cried Herman, in deadly fear.</p>
                    <p>âThou mayest hear, thou canst not see them. Kneel, cover thy face, and pray.
                        Think of all pure and holy things, of thy love on earth, of thy trust in
                        heaven. Remember, one evil thought will drive from<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7020-222"></pb> thee these blessed spirits. Herman, they
                        comeâthey come!â</p>
                    <p>Herman listened to a sound which he rather felt than heard; it was like the
                        step of one beloved coming nearer and nearer, each soft foot-fall sending a
                        thrill to heart. And then he perceived that Leuthold had unclasped his hand,
                        but that Another was beside him. He fancied his hair was stirred by a soft
                        breath, such as he had felt in dreamsâdreams of Hilda, and it seemed that
                        this angel-breath penetrated to his inmost heart, filling it with child-like
                        purity and peace.</p>
                    <p>He was roused from this trance by the deep solemn tones of Leuthold, and knew
                        that his friend was addressing no mortal, but the Angel of which he had
                        spoken. With serene earnestness the student lifted up his voice, and told
                        all his heart's desire to the mysterious Presences that were with them in
                        the room. He spoke not in slavish fear, but like one who, with a lofty and
                        awful joy, holds communion with those who, though superior, are drawn to him
                        by love, until they speak as friend to friend.</p>
                    <p>And he was answered. From the silence came forth a voiceânot human, and yet
                        like humanity in its sweetness. Much of what it said was inexplicable to
                        Herman, whose whole life had been spent in worldly delights, and who knew
                        not the joys which the soul feels when retiring into communion with itself,
                        and those essences to which it is akin. But Leuthold understood all.</p>
                    <p>âListen,â said the Angel, âO thou who art my<pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7020-223"></pb> care! Man's is a double existence. Ever following his spirit, as the
                        shadow follows his body, is a second self. It is not his soul, but only the
                        reflection of it, like the faint arch within the rainbow, or the giant
                        mountain-shadows which mimic men. Generally this phantasm is inseparable
                        from the reality which produces it; but at times man has been suffered to
                        behold the reflex of himself; and often, too, has this second self appeared
                        to those to whom the man was dear, a dim spectre of prophetic woe.â</p>
                    <p>âI know it, I know it!â cried Leuthold, mournfully. âEven the night before
                        death took my mother from me, as we sat together in the twilight, I saw a
                        Shadow like herself come and sit opposite to us! And she knew it was a sign,
                        and went in and lay down calmly to restâa rest that was eternal.â He
                        pausedâhis silence showing on what a deep and tender nature had fallen this
                        first wound. âBut, Angel, I would not thus see the phantom of myself; I
                        desire to behold my living form as with the eye of a spirit. Canst thou
                        grant this?â</p>
                    <p>âOnly thus. Thou must thyself become the attendant shadow; must abstract thy
                        mind for a season from all earthly things, until it becomes, as in dreams,
                        separate from the body. Then thy spirit, or that portion of it which is
                        active in dreams, may float over its living self, and behold, for a time,
                        all that thou dost and all that thou art, even like a disembodied soul. But
                        know, for each day in which thou thus gainest thy desire, a year will be
                        taken from thy mortal life.â</p>
                    <pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7020-224"></pb>
                    <p>âEven soâthat would add to the boon,â said Leuthold, softly. âBut, Herman,
                        life is bright to thee, wilt thou consent likewise?â</p>
                    <p>Herman shuddered and bowed his face lower to the earth, as he felt the
                        invisible breath beside him form itself into a voice. But it was not like
                        the one which had spoken to Leutholdâit sounded faint and indistinct.</p>
                    <p>âOnce only in thy life mayest thou hear thy angel's voice, Herman! and once
                        only is this faculty permitted to thee. Wouldst thou for a single day behold
                        thyself?â</p>
                    <p>âI wouldâI would!â muttered Herman; and as he spoke the whole chamber was
                        flooded with the light of the moon, as she broke through the edge of a dark
                        cloud. He lifted up his head, but saw only his friend, who, pale and almost
                        insensible, leaned against the wall, like one just awakened out of a
                    dream.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">HERMAN</hi> rose up at dawn on the morrow, forgetting all the
                        strange excitement which he had gone through. It had passed from his memory
                        like a dream. He<pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7020-225"></pb> leaped out through his
                        low window into the glad daylight, walked through his beautiful domain,
                        heard the birds singing a blithe welcome to the morning, saw the sunshine
                        resting upon the noble old hall, until it looked almost as if it had renewed
                        its youth. He felt to the full the happiness of life. All the fantastic
                        imaginings of night had vanished with the coming of daylight.</p>
                    <p>Existence was in every way a reality to Herman Waldhof. He was the embodiment
                        of youth in its full enjoyment of the present, keenly alive to every delight
                        of sense, and revelling in life as a happy certainty of tangible bliss,
                        quite distinct from the enthusiastic visions of the dreamer. A young man,
                        full of health and gaietyâbound by no ties, save those he chose to forge for
                        himselfârich, though, as he had said, his wishes often outran his
                        wealth;âuntil the shadow of love fell over him, Herman had never known a
                        care. Yet his love, though it had made him more thoughtful, brought with it
                        no real sorrow, but only those few faint doubts which nourish and strengthen
                        as April rain. Love without such would be like the spring without showers.</p>
                    <p>Waldhof bounded through his fields, exulting in the bright day, and in his
                        own happiness. He called his huntsmen around him, and made ready for the
                        chase. It would serve to beguile the tedious hours until the lover could
                        again seek the presence of his beloved. But before he set out, he rode with
                        his companions through the street where Hilda dwelt. A goodly<pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7020-226"></pb> troop of young men they were, but there were none
                        so noble in bearing as Herman Waldhof. He knew it, too; and as he passed
                        Hilda's window, he felt almost glad that the horseman who rode beside him
                        was the Graf von Pâ, a small and ungainly man, badly mounted. As Herman made
                        his own fine charger curvet, and, doffing his hat, let the sunshine rest on
                        his curling hair, a smile of proud delight curved his lips. For he saw
                        through the lattice two fair eyes, which lingered not on the Graf von Pâ,
                        but on himself.</p>
                    <p>âI wonder,â thought the young man, âhow I appear to-day in Hilda's sight?â</p>
                    <p>As the idea crossed his mind, it seemed that his steed dashed wildly along,
                        confusing all his faculties. His eyes grew dazzled with the motion caused by
                        passing swiftly through the air, and he hardly knew what affected him, until
                        he woke out of a kind of stupor. He felt himself floating through the air as
                        one does in dreams; but his personal identity was gone. He glided along as
                        bodiless as a winged thought, and yet he clearly distinguished everything
                        around him as when he had been gifted with corporeal senses. He was floating
                        amidst the trees of a wild forest, he heard the ringing music of the horn,
                        and beneath him gallopped a troop of gay huntsmen. One among them was
                        remarkable for personal beauty and agility. He sat his steed with the grace
                        and firmness of a young Greek warrior, and his joyous laugh resounded
                        through the forest as if he had been the light-hearted ActÃ¦on of old. In
                        this youth, so apparently happy, so beautiful<pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7020-227"></pb> in person, the hovering spirit of Herman Waldhof
                        recognised himself. His wish had been attained.</p>
                    <p>Like a cloud in the air the Shadow floated over the merry troop, and followed
                        them through the glades of the forest. It beheld its corporeal selfâthe man
                        who was Herman Waldhof; it scanned his features with keen inquiry. They were
                        as perfect in form as the mirror had always reflected them; but now, when
                        agitated by the play of expression, there was a vague deficiencyâa want of
                        that inexpressible charm which sometimes makes the most ordinary face
                        enchanting by the inward beauty of the mind. Herman's features were as
                        unchangeable in their expression as those of the Apollo Belvidereâif you
                        sought anything beyond, you might as well seek it in that marble. The Shadow
                        into which a portion of the young man's soul had fled, retained enough of
                        its mortal nature to feel this want and deplore it, and turned its
                        observation to other qualities of its second self.</p>
                    <p>Most noble was the bearing of the young huntsman, but still an unprejudiced
                        eye might distinguish in his manly form too much of strength and too little
                        of grace. He was an incipient Hercules, who might become in middle age
                        anything but lithe and active. Winning he was in manner, and yet, both in
                        that and in his tone of voice, was apparent an occasional harshness that in
                        an inferior would have been most unpleasing, but which was disregarded in
                        the wealthy and fascinating Herman Waldhof. His companions treated him as a
                        privileged person, bore with<pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7020-228"></pb> his
                        haughtiness, and laughed at his jests, even when directed against
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>âWe shall find no game to-day,â said Herman, with a shade of annoyance
                        perceptible in his tone.</p>
                    <p>âYou have driven it far into the inner forest with your constant hunts,
                        Waldhof,â answered one of the young men. âTruly, all we huntsmen ought to be
                        very grateful for a whole year's amusement at your cost.â</p>
                    <p>âOh, 'tis nothing,â returned Herman. âI love the chase, therefore I follow
                        it. Having plenty of horses and every other appurtenance of wealth, I can
                        oblige my friends and please myself with their society at the same time.
                        By-the-by, Von Pâ, why did you not go to my stable? My grooms would have
                        better provided you than with that sorry steed of yours?â</p>
                    <p>The Graf von Pâ turned crimson with vexation.</p>
                    <p>âA poor nobleman is sometimes worse off than a rich commoner, but he is not
                        the less proud. With all thanks for his courtesy, Herr Waldhof will excuse
                        my preferring my own horse.â</p>
                    <p>âJust as you like!â answered the young man, carelessly, totally unconscious
                        of the pain he had caused; but the Shadow of his being saw in that passing
                        incident, an ostentation for which the open-handed generosity of youth could
                        not atone, and a thoughtlessness of others which showed selfishness lurking
                        in the depths of an otherwise frank and kindly nature. A superficial
                        observer might not notice these things, but one who could read the inner
                        foldings of the human heart would at<pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7020-229"></pb> once
                        recognise them as blemishes in the character of Herman Waldhof.</p>
                    <p>The young huntsmen rode merrily on, and the prey was found. Now all the
                        ardour of the chase began. Exulting in his dauntless courage, Herman was the
                        foremost in all dangerous exploits. His eyes flashed, his colour heightened,
                        and his voice rang out merrily. More than once he dashed between the enraged
                        boar and one of the assailants, thereby perilling his own life, and
                        preserving that of another fellow-creature. And then they all cried, âhow
                        generous, how heroic was the young Herman Waldhof!â and the dim Shadow which
                        followed him rejoiced triumphantly in the praise of its other self.</p>
                    <p>The hunted boar turned at bay, and the crisis of the sport arrived. All drew
                        back, and left the master of the chase to perform the crowning exploit. It
                        was an honour which Herman had ever claimed as a right. He glanced proudly
                        round and spurred his horse, poising his spear with a firm, bold hand. But,
                        in a moment, another horseman dashed forward, and despatching the wild
                        beast, turned exultingly to claim the final honours of the chase. It was the
                        Graf von Pâ!</p>
                    <p>Instantly the beaming face of Herman was darkened by a thunder-cloud of
                        anger, until the features that were before so beautiful grew almost hideous
                        in their wrathful disdain. He was about to plunge his horse forward, and
                        direct his reeking spearânot against the dead boar, but the living manâhad
                        not a murmur from the other huntsmen arrested him.</p>
                    <pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7020-230"></pb>
                    <p>âIt was not right of Von Pâ!â âHerman should have slain the boar!â said
                        various of his friends.</p>
                    <p>âHave I done aught to anger Herr Waldhof?â observed the surprised nobleman.</p>
                    <p>âYou have insulted me!â angrily exclaimed his rival. âI am the lord of the
                        forest: it is my place, not yours, to despatch the beast. Look to yourself,
                        my lord! Herman Waldhof is the equal of any Graf in Germany.â</p>
                    <p>âI am a strangerâI know not your customs. If I have erred in courtesy, I
                        regret it,â answered the young nobleman, with an unmoved dignity that turned
                        the tide of opinion in his favour. Herman rode homewards; and as the
                        hovering spirit looked down upon him, it saw how evil passions had marred
                        the fairest characteristics of nature; and how a stranger, beholding him a
                        prey to violent and angry feeling, would see no trace of the noble youth who
                        had been so lately the admiration of every eye.</p>
                    <p>On his journey home the Shadow accompanied him, and watched the gradual
                        dispersion of bitterness from a nature that never retained evil long. And as
                        the hour drew nigh that was to bring him to Hilda, every trace of wrathful
                        emotion was swept away under the soothing influence of his love. Apparently,
                        he thought of Hildaâhe closed his eyes, and called up her dear face to his
                        memoryâhe imagined how she would welcome him, what he should say to her, and
                        what she would answer: and in these delicious love-reveries an inexpressible
                        sweetness became diffused over his face. When the<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7020-231"></pb> shadowy Self followed him to the presence of his
                        love, it exulted over his grace and beauty.</p>
                    <p>Hilda was not, like her lover, perfect in form and face. A passing eye might
                        have overlooked her, but those who loved her thought her fair, and all loved
                        her who knew her. A painter would have adored her soft brown eyes and lovely
                        hair, and a musician would have said her voice was the sweetest in the
                        world; and yet neither might have called Hilda beautiful. It was the
                        atmosphere of love and purity in which she moved, investing all her looks,
                        words, and deeds, with an irresistible charm, that made her the ideal of
                        perfect womanhood.</p>
                    <p>She rose up and welcomed her loverâin her heart of hearts she knew that he
                            <emph>was</emph> her lover, though no formal words had passed between
                        them. Yet with a maidenly reserve she shut up in her heart the secret
                        consciousness which made its chiefest joy. Herman thought her tone was
                        coldâthat her hand touched his with a careless pressure: he did not know
                        that at the sound of his horse's approach, a few moments before, those
                        little hands had been pressed wildly upon the throbbing heart, and then
                        spread over the fair, blushing face, that would fain hide even from the dumb
                        walls its radiant yet timid happiness.</p>
                    <p>Herman came and sat by his beloved; the ever attendant Shadow watched him, as
                        he talked in a tone low and gentle. How winning he could be at will!âtruly
                        it was no marvel that Hilda loved him! He spoke of common things, of his
                        day's sport, and<pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7020-232"></pb> then, with a frankness
                        that showed in a golden light all the higher qualities of his nature, he
                        confessed to Hilda the incident which had annoyed him. Perhaps mingled with
                        this sincerity was a consciousness that the story would come best from his
                        own lips, and that Hilda would seek to palliate a fault so candidly
                        acknowledged, thus restoring him to his own good opinion, which he had
                        well-nigh lost.</p>
                    <p>But Hilda listened without a word of praise or extenuation. She could not
                        trust her voice, lest it should betray the love that was so nigh
                        overflowing, and yet had no warrant for its utterance. And perhaps, too, she
                        felt a woman's pain that a shadow of error should dim the brightness of her
                        idol.</p>
                    <p>âI have heard of this before,â she said.</p>
                    <p>âWho told you? Who dared speak ill of me to you?â cried the young man, and
                        the dark cloud of anger again came over him. The Shadow saw, and fled back
                        troubled.</p>
                    <p>Hilda lifted her eyes to his with a look of pained surprise, mingled with
                        reproach. âWe will talk no more of this,â she answered, gently.</p>
                    <p>Her look and tone calmed her lover in a moment.</p>
                    <p>âDo not chide me, fair and dear maiden,â replied he. âI was in error, perhaps
                        not so much as they say and as you imagine, but still I am willing to
                        acknow. ledge aught that you please.â</p>
                    <p>His words were humble, yet there was pride in their tone, as if he expected
                        them to be contradicted immediately; but this the truthful spirit of the
                            young<pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7020-233"></pb> girl would not do. She loved him
                        well; and love, which made all his good qualities shine in her eyes with
                        double lustre, rendered her proportionately quicksighted to his failings.</p>
                    <p>âHerr Waldhof,â said Hilda, gravely, âI ask no confession if caused alone by
                        your <emph>friendship</emph>ââthe innocent hypocrisy of those dear
                        lips!ââyour friendship for me. It was not right of you to be so angry with
                        the Graf Von Pâ, who meant you no disrespect. Besides, as your friend, heââ</p>
                    <p>â<emph>My</emph> friend! the poor, cowardly creature <emph>my</emph> friend!
                        Say your own, rather, if so you mean!â cried the lover, hardly suppressing
                        his jealous indignation.</p>
                    <p>Hilda's womanly pride was roused.</p>
                    <p>âAs you will,â she answered, with a quivering lip and heightened colour. âI
                        am not used to discussions so warm as this, therefore, Herr Waldhof, I will
                        bid you adieu, as I believe my father desires your presence.â</p>
                    <p>She lightly touched the hand which, in his mortification, the young man
                        scarcely held out to her, and, with a step of maidenly dignity, glided from
                        the room.</p>
                    <p>With a sense of the deepest abasement, the shadowy Presence looked down upon
                        its other self, as the young man paced the room in violent emotion, raving
                        against Hilda, his rival, and the whole world.</p>
                    <p>âShe loves me not! she scorns me! she pleads in behalf of the wretch Von Pâ!â
                        he muttered. âNot one gentle feeling is in her heart for me, or she would
                        not have spoken thus!â</p>
                    <pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7020-234"></pb>
                    <p>Oh, self-deceiver, blinded by anger! could thine eye but have pierced into
                        the next chamber, and seen that weeping girl who passed from thee but now
                        with so firm a step; couldst thou have known the anguish that came with the
                        discovery of one fault in thee, and yet the love which would fain wash it
                        all away with pardoning tears, and defend thee against the whole world!</p>
                    <p>Herman leaped on his horse, nor stayed his frantic speed until he reached his
                        own home. He locked himself up in his chamber, and sank down exhausted. Long
                        he remained in a state which seemed half-sleeping, half-waking, until the
                        morning birds aroused him. Then the whole charm was dispelled; the events of
                        yesterday returned vividly to his memory: he became conscious of the double
                        existence which had then been his, and knewâoh, with what bitterness came
                        the knowledge!âthat he had <emph>beheld himself</emph>.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">LEUTHOLD</hi> watched from the window of the small room where he
                        slept, ate, and studied, the merry troop of huntsmen go by. He saw, loftiest
                            among<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7020-235"></pb> them, the graceful head of his
                        friend Herman. The clanging of the hoofs in the street below had disturbed
                        him from his studies; and as he closed the window and turned away from the
                        sunshine, the glittering dresses, and the sound of gay voicesâthe darkness
                        and solitude of his own poor chamber struck him mournfully. He leaned his
                        forehead against his open book, and tried to shut out from his view alike
                        the brightness without and the gloom withinâboth were equally painful.</p>
                    <p>âHow happy they seem! how gay!â thought the young man with sadness. âAnd
                        I?âWell, let me calmly think what I am, and what I would fain be. Would I
                        change with them?âbecome noble, and handsome, and rich as they; have no care
                        but for the pleasures of life? Ah, but age will come; the strong limbs will
                        grow feeble; the gay spirit become soured; the mind sink to a mere animal
                        existence. Would I change with them, then? No!â</p>
                    <p>And the student strove to cheer himself with the consciousness of the high
                        aim of life. He remembered that man's godlike mind is not given him to be
                        cast aside like an useless thing, nor is he created to waste his existence
                        in the passing pursuit of pleasure. While he pondered, he looked around on
                        the dear companions of his lonelinessâprecious, though silentâhis beloved
                        books; and he envied not Herman Waldhof himself; save for that most
                        priceless treasure, which the student would have died to gainâHilda's love.</p>
                    <p>âHow noble he looked as he passed her window!â<pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7020-236"></pb> thought Leuthold. âHow dare I compare myself to
                        him!â and the student gazed mournfully down upon his own slight, meagre
                        limbs, and thin hands. âOh, that I could dieâthat I could lose the memory of
                        this bitter, hopeless love!â Bowing his head upon his knees, and forgetting
                        his manhood, he gave way to the weakness of a nature which resembled a
                        woman's in sensitiveness, and sobbed as in his childish days.</p>
                    <p>With the reaction of his feelings the young man grew calmer. âI will be
                        patientâI will endure,â continued he, pursuing the train of his thoughts.
                        âThe sunshine of life is not for me: I must train my spirit to live content
                        in its shade. Why murmur, poor heart! the future will but be as the past.
                        From my cradle life has been a solitude. I have never known the joy of being
                        beloved!â But while Leuthold uttered this, a remorseful pang touched his
                        heart, and a faint, spirit-like voice, seemed to fall on his ear,ââMy son,
                        my son, hast thou then forgotten me?â</p>
                    <p>The student threw himself on his knees, and cried, âForgive me, oh, my
                        mother, if this wild love for a moment shuts out the memory of thine! Pure
                        and angelic spirit, comfort me now!â He clasped a crucifix, and remained
                        muttering the habitual devotions of a religion, in which even the depths of
                        his philosophical learning had not shaken his beliefâit was too near his
                        heart for any mere powers of intellect to overthrow it. Gradually a numbness
                        oppressed his faculties; the realities around him faded into shadows, until
                            he<pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7020-237"></pb> seemed to wake at last, like one
                        who, dreaming, dreams he is roused from a dream. In that moment, the
                        mysterious change for which he had longed passed over Leuthold; his spirit
                        became divided, and beheld its bodily Self.</p>
                    <p>The form which engarmented that pure and noble soul was not beautiful. The
                        Shadow looked down upon Leuthold as he knelt, and thought how mean was the
                        figure of the studentâdiminutive, stooping, though not actually deformed.
                        The face was sallow; the features irregular; and when in repose, ordinary
                        and inexpressive. The sole redeeming portions of the face were a high, broad
                        forehead, and large, soft, gray eyes, shaded by lashes as long and silken as
                        a woman's. But it could not be denied that, as he appeared now, scarce a
                        trace of personal beauty did the student possess.</p>
                    <p>Leuthold rose, put aside his books, and went out into the streets of Leipsic.
                        The invisible Shadow followed him, and watched him as he moved. His slight,
                        low figure would have passed unnoticed through the crowd of a great city;
                        but here in Leipsic, which was for ages the stronghold of learning, there
                        were many to whom Leuthold Auerbach was known, as one whose wisdom surpassed
                        his years. Not a few, both of the old whose companionship he sought, and the
                        young who came to him for instruction, doffed their hats as he passed. The
                        pleasant smile of recognition lighted up his face, and the Shadow saw that
                        his step grew firmer, and even his stature seemed to rise, with<pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7020-238"></pb> a consciousness that he was respected by those
                        whose respect was grateful to him.</p>
                    <p>He went on to the great hall of Leipsic, where students and professors were
                        accustomed to meet for discussion, and to give and receive instruction. It
                        was a high day, and within those walls were collected many of the learned
                        from all parts of Germany. As Leuthold passed through the division where sat
                        the younger of the company, many of them his own pupils, he heard a murmur
                        of respectful congratulation. His eye brightened, and his lips relaxed into
                        a smile almost as bright as Herman's. The Spirit feltâphantom as it wasâas
                        if a sunbeam of gladness had shot through its airy being.</p>
                    <p>âWe have been looking for you, Herr Auerbach,â said one of the young men.
                        âThe great doctor from Cologne has mentioned you with praise; and our
                        professor has chosen you to deliver the harangue, as being the most learned
                        of the students of Leipsic.â</p>
                    <p>Leuthold's cheek flushed with pleasure; and he walked with a dignified step
                        to the upper end of the hall, where the learned conclave awaited him. There
                        he heard that the fame of Leuthold of Leipsic had reached to distant cities.
                        Many, whose heads were white with long years of study, came forward to press
                        with friendly grasp the hand of the young man. He, in self-possessed yet
                        modest humility, which gave a gracefulness to his whole deportment, received
                        their congratulations and praise.</p>
                    <p>âThey told me I should see a plain, common- <choice>
                            <orig>look-</orig>
                            <reg>looking</reg>
                        </choice><pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7020-239"></pb> ing young man,â whispered the
                        great <foreign xml:lang="fre">savant</foreign> of Cologne. I do not find him
                        so. His manner is dignified yet retiring; his countenance beams with
                        intellect.â</p>
                    <p>âYou are right. He has the beauty of a noble mind. I am proud of my pupil,â
                        answered the professor, who was Hilda's father.</p>
                    <p>The Shadow heard, and its airy essence thrilled with joy.</p>
                    <p>Now, from amidst the crowded assembly, rose the voice of Leuthold Auerbach.
                        It was low and tremulous at first, as if oppressed by the dead silence
                        around; but as the speaker advanced it became firm. Already we have said
                        that Leuthold possessed that irresistible charmâa low, clear, and melodious
                        voice. These exquisite tones were now like music, accompanying the deep
                        wisdom which they uttered. Leuthold was not an impassioned orator; with him
                        all feelings lay deep, giving an outward calmness to all he said and did;
                        therefore his words now were more those of a sage who reasoned for a great
                        truth, than of a young man who poured forth his emotions in flowery
                        eloquence. But the clearness and earnestness of his own mind communicated
                        itself to his speech, and thence to the heart as well as to the intellect of
                        the multitude, who listened as it were one man. When he concluded, first a
                        deep silence, more expressive than applause, and then a shout of
                        congratulation that made the hall re-echo, proclaimed the triumph of the
                        student</p>
                    <p> Almost overpowered, Leuthold sank back, and his friends crowded round him.
                        Foremost among them<pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7020-240"></pb> was the learned
                        professor, who had been his teacher in the days of his early youth.</p>
                    <p>âYou must come home with me to-day,â said the kindly old man. âHilda will
                        rejoice to hear of your success.â</p>
                    <p>The Shadow looked down upon itself, and saw that Leuthold's face glowed with
                        rapture, and his very lips trembled with emotion.</p>
                    <p>âI am weary now, my kind master,â answered he, taking the professor's hand
                        affectionately; âbut I will come to-nightâyes! tell <emph>her</emph> I will
                        come to-night,â he repeated, almost unconsciously.</p>
                    <p>Still under the influence of the joy which gave beauty to his whole
                        appearance, Leuthold took his way homeward. He sat a long time in his quiet
                        roomâit hardly looked so lonely as it had done in the morning, and he
                        himself appeared no longer the pale and drooping student, who had knelt in
                        despair before the crucifix. He rested his head on his hand, and the ever
                        present Phantom watched. It was a face that any man might have looked on
                        with reverence, any woman with love. As the day wore on, he heard the troop
                        of huntsmen go by on their return: but they gave him no pain; he did not
                        even move to watch them. When evening came, he wrapped himself in his cloak,
                        and went out to visit Hilda. Ere he reached the door a horseman galloped
                        furiously past him. Leuthold turned, and saw that it was Herman, his dark
                        hair flying in the wind, and his whole mien disordered.</p>
                    <p>âPoor Herman! he is annoyed; perhaps he has<pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7020-241"></pb>
                        been unsuccessful at the chase, in which he delights so much,â thought the
                        student; and in his simple and gentle nature, Leuthold almost reproached
                        himself for being happy while his friend was not so. But he remembered
                        Herman no longer when he entered Hilda's dwelling.</p>
                    <p>It was a small, pleasant chamber, into which he passed; how well he knew
                        every nook of it! There, night after night, in the long winter evenings, the
                        motherless, lonely youth had been made welcome by his kind old master; and
                        the little Hilda had joyfully welcomed a playfellow who was so much gentler
                        than her own wild brothers. There, as years went on, the young man had
                        listened to the evening instructions of the professor, while Hilda, now
                        growing womanly and reserved, but kind and sisterly still, sat by. Leuthold
                        glanced lovingly towards the corner where she used to work, the lamp shining
                        on her smooth brown hair, and her quick-moving fingers. Oh, how happy were
                        those days! Musing thus, the student waited for the entrance of his beloved.</p>
                    <p>Hilda came at last. She met him cordially, took his hand in both hersâthe
                        poor Leuthold, how he trembled at the touch!âand told him how glad she was
                        of his triumph that day.</p>
                    <p>âMy father is proud of you, Leuthold; we are all proud of you. You must not
                        forget us when you are a great man!â said Hilda, with a frank and pleasant
                        smile.</p>
                    <p>The student looked at her with his whole soul in his<pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7020-242"></pb> eyesâthose beautiful gray eyes! He leaned over
                        her as she sat, and became absorbed in the bliss of her presence. They
                        talked, as they always did, of things that both loved, of the future that
                        was opening before their young life; she with the open-hearted kindliness of
                        her nature, conversing with a dear friend; and he drinking in love ineffable
                        from her every word and look. The Shadow hovered over him, and perceived how
                        that the magic of love gave new music to his voice, and new eloquence to his
                        tongue; how it lighted up his face, and made his homely features almost
                        divine with the radiance of a commanding intellect, and a heart full of all
                        that is pure and good in man. The spirit beheld, and gloried in itself.</p>
                    <p>Hilda talked to Leuthold with the kindly earnestness of a heart which had
                        nothing to concealâalas for him, not even the sweet secret of love! She
                        praised him, she spoke of his coming career of fame, and, more glorious
                        still than fame, the proud delight of a life spent in the soul's true
                        vocationâthat of adding to the wisdom of past ages, and of so carrying one's
                        own lamp, be it great or small, that future generations may grow wiser and
                        better through its guiding radiance.</p>
                    <p>âYou are gentle as well as wise, Leuthold,â said the maiden. âYou will go
                        through life happy and beloved. All is well with you.â</p>
                    <p>Her voice had a softened tone, almost sad; and her whole manner was
                        subduedâfor while speaking to Leuthold, she was thinking of one dearer.
                            The<pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7020-243"></pb> student was deceived by her kind
                        words, the tremulousiness of her voice, the sudden changing of her cheek,
                        her troubled and anxious air. He believedâoh, the madness of the dream!âthat
                        there was yet hope for him, that in time he might be loved even as he loved.</p>
                    <p>He mentioned Herman; but she who in happiness would have blushed and trembled
                        at the chance hearing of the beloved name, now in her sorrow could listen to
                        it unmoved. No outward sign of love for his rival came to dim the young
                        man's hope.</p>
                    <p>âI saw Waldhof on my way hither, and thought he would have been with you
                        to-night,â continued Lenthold.</p>
                    <p>âHe came, but soon departed,â said Hilda, calmly; and the student dared ask
                        no more. Could it be that Herman Waldhof had returned an unsuccessful wooer?
                        And if so, why? The bare idea made the heart of him who loved so madly throb
                        with added violence. He was too noble to rejoice at the sorrow of his
                        friend; and yet human nature is weak, and Love is a king who conquers all
                        other feelings. That Hilda should be freeâthat he might dare to seek her
                        love! The thought overpowered him; and, as the Shadow of his soul read all
                        these conflicting feelings in the face of the student, it became troubled
                        likewise.</p>
                    <p>âWhat ails thee, Leuthold?â said Hilda, kindly, as she noticed his agitated
                        countenance. âThy hand is burning, too!â and the touch of her soft cool
                        fingers thrilled to his heart. âDear friend,â she added, âI<pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7020-244"></pb> must send thee away. Go home and sleepâthis day's
                        happiness is too much for thee.â</p>
                    <p>âIt isâit is too much,â passionately cried the student. He dared not trust
                        himself with another word or look, but, bidding Hilda a hurried adieu, he
                        went out.</p>
                    <p>In the cool night, beneath the quiet stars, his frenzy passed away; a soft
                        dreaminess overpowered him, and the spell was ended. Leuthold knew that his
                        desire had been fulfilled; clearly and distinctly his natural self
                        remembered all that the Shadow had beheld. The knowledge gave him no false
                        pride; but a delicious consciousness of what he was in himself and how he
                        was regarded by others, crept into his heart, and imparted to it courage,
                        firmness, and peace. The timid, self-abased student now knew his own worth,
                        and became brave.</p>

                        when thy soul suddenly passes out of darkness into lightâwhen, after wearily
                        walking in gloom, the sun of some long-shrouded joy gleams through the mist,
                        and thy tears are dried up like dew-drops in the morning. Life becomes
                        pleasant to theeâall things look beautiful in thine eyes, as in those of a
                        blind man<pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7020-245"></pb> who has just received sight;
                        thou rememberest no more the time of darkness, but goest forth rejoicing in
                        the unhoped-for light.</p>
                    <p>Thus it was with Leuthold, when at sunrise he awoke. How sweet was the
                        waking! First, there came the dim memory of some inexplicable happiness, and
                        then a name rose to his lips. The remembrance of his loveâday by day his
                        earliest waking thoughtâcame upon him with a full tide of recollection. But
                        there was a change. The young man rose up and looked out on the daylight;
                        never had it before seemed so fair. His eyes grew dim with overpowering
                        bliss; he stretched out his arms, as if he would embrace the whole world in
                        the fulness of his joy; he murmured the name of her he loved, adding to it
                        those words which he had never yet dared to utterââMine <emph>own</emph>!
                        mine <emph>own</emph>!â</p>
                    <p>Alas! alas! for the love that can thus deceive itself!</p>
                    <p>Leuthold went to his books, but his ideas wandered. What had philosophy to do
                        with love? Sometimes a painful thought of Herman flitted across his mind. If
                        Hilda loved him not, how wretched he must be!</p>
                    <p>âBut he will forget it in time. Herman's love is not like mine,â murmured the
                        student. âHe has many joys; I only oneâbut that passing all others!â</p>
                    <p>Again came Hilda's image; and the young lover gave himself up to a sweet
                        reverie. He pictured his future life; he conjured up the vision of a home,
                        calm, peaceful, where he might follow the pursuits he loved, and become
                        learned and honoured among men.<pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7020-246"></pb> He thought
                        how proudly the professor would give his daughter to one who deserved to win
                        her; and, mingled with the idea of the old man, came that of childhood; of
                        sweet young faces crowding round him; of fame to be reaped for them, that
                        they might rejoice in their father's name when he was in the dust; and above
                        all, the image of Hilda, in wifehood, in motherhood, in still fair and
                        still-beloved old age. How they twain would glide together through life! not
                        living as the worldly doâas if this existence were allâbut ever looking
                        upwards together, firmly believing that those who are one in love, and one
                        in heart and mind, whatever be the after destiny of the soul, will never be
                        divided.</p>
                    <p>All day Leuthold could not drive away the blissful dream. It nestled close to
                        his heart, and would not go; it followed him when he went out into the busy
                        streets; it coloured everything with its own rosy light. The faces he met
                        seemed to peer into his, as if divining the secret of his happiness. Only
                        one fear oppressed himâlest he might perchance see Herman. But the day
                        passed and Herman came not. In the evening Leuthold went out into the open
                        country, where he thought no prying eyes could behold his joy. Yet, even
                        there, the clouds as they passed over him seemed to form themselves into the
                        semblance of Hilda's face, and the little birds as they sang almost
                        âsyllabled her name.â All nature to Leuthold was full of love.</p>
                    <p>As he walked dreamily along, a step overtook him, his hand was warmly
                        grasped, and Herman stood before him.</p>
                    <pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7020-247"></pb>
                    <p>âWhy, you are sauntering like a man asleep!â said young Waldhof.</p>
                    <p>Leuthold changed colour, and looked anxiously at his friend. Herman's face
                        was not without some traces of agitation; but there was no sorrow there.</p>
                    <p>âI have sought for you everywhere,â continued the other. âI have much to
                        tell, Leuthold.â</p>
                    <p>âHave you, too, attained your desire?â asked Leuthold, hurriedly. âHave the
                        angels we beheld that nightââ</p>
                    <p>âI dreamed a dream, but I have forgotten it now, save for what it taught me.
                        Oh, Leuthold, I have had a bitter lesson, but it has ended in joyâHilda
                        loves me!â</p>
                    <p>There are strokes so terrible, so stunning, that the heart within us seems to
                        turn to ice, and that is all. A thunderbolt sometimes slays without an
                        outward wound. Thus it was with Leuthold. His life's hope was shattered, but
                        no visible token betrayed the death-stroke within.</p>
                    <p>Herman drew his friend's arm within his own, and they sat down under a tree.
                        There, with his face turned away from Leuthold, the young man told the whole
                        story of his anger, and its punishment.</p>
                    <p>âThis morning,â he cried, âI knew myself as I had never known before. I was
                        humbled to the dust. I longed to throw myself at Hilda's feet, and say,
                        âHate me, despise me; I deserve it. I am not worthy to look upon thee, and
                        yet I love thee!ââ</p>
                    <pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7020-248"></pb>
                    <p>âAnd thou didst say so, Herman?â said the student very calmly.</p>
                    <p>âYes, best Leuthold; my good angel was with me: I poured out my heart before
                        her in its shame, in its humility, and she contemned it not. She forgave me
                        for my love's sake. Listen to what she saidâevery one of her sweet words is
                        written on my heart. âThou art very thoughtless, Hermanâthou art full of
                        faultsâthou art not half so gentle as Leuthold; and yet I love theeâonly
                        thee.â And then she laid her dear arms round my neck.âWhy, Leuthold, how
                        thou shiverest!â</p>
                    <p>âThe wind is coldâvery cold,â muttered the unfortunate student.</p>
                    <p>âThen take my cloak. Comeâwe will sit no longer here: thou art not so strong
                        as I,â answered the other, as with unwonted gentleness of manner he led his
                        friend homeward. Happy love had given all his better feelings freer play.</p>
                    <p>âI sometimes think it strange that thou shouldst never have loved Hilda,â
                        said Herman, as they walked on slowly, âor that she should not have loved
                        thee.â</p>
                    <p>âLoved <emph>me</emph>!âme!â repeated Leuthold.</p>
                    <p>âYes, it might have been. I was almost jealous of thee when Hilda spoke so
                        warmly of thee this morning, and I told her so. But she only smiled, and
                        said thou hadst never dreamed of such a thingâthat thou wert as a brother to
                        her, and hadst never loved aught except thy books. But the time will come,
                        LeutholdâHilda says soâwhen thou, too, wilt know the bliss of<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7020-249"></pb> happy love. Thou shouldst have heard her praise
                        thee, ay, even beyond myself. And then she described the sort of damsel that
                        would win thy hard heartâbeautiful as an angel, gentle as a dove. Ha! ha!
                        Leuthold, dost hear?â laughed the gay-hearted young man.</p>
                    <p>Leuthold laughed too. So strong was his self-control that the keenest ear
                        could not have distinguished a discordant tone in that awful mirth. The
                        friendly darkness hid the convulsions of his features, the clench of his
                        hands, the torturing pain that seemed as if a fiend's clutch were at his
                        throat; and Leuthold conquered. But angels would have looked down and wept
                        over him who struggled so fearfully with himself, that in the contest life
                        was almost riven asunder. At his own door the student parted from Herman,
                        kindly, cheerfully, as usual; nay, listened to the careless footstep of the
                        young man as he passed down the street, humming a light ditty, half-playful,
                        half-tender, for it was of love. The sounds died away, and Leuthold was
                        alone.</p>
                    <p>Let us not depict the anguish of that first hour of terrible awakening from
                        the dream of a lifetime. They to whom love is but the crowning link of many
                        sweet bonds, the last nectar-drop in a cup already running over with all
                        life's other blessings, can never know what it is to those who have nought
                        else. Such loveâthe love of yearsâis not merely the chief aim of life; it is
                        life itself. What must the rending be? We cannot paintâwe dare not! God help
                        those who have thus lost all!</p>
                    <pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7020-250"></pb>
                    <p>A night of agony passed, and Leuthold had striven with his own soul, until he
                        had taught it that most blessed of lessonsâto endure. In the silence and
                        gloom a spirit-hand had been laid upon his heart, and its wild beatings grew
                        still. A spirit-voice had breathed in his ear, âPeace, peace! others, too,
                        have suffered and found rest.â Then Leuthold answered in his soulââYes, I
                        know, in the grave.â But the voice replied, solemnly and reproachfullyââAnd
                        in life, too, there is peace. Thinkest thou that the All-good would send His
                        children on earth for cureless sorrow? There is no grief so heavy that it
                        cannot be borne, until patience becomes in the end calmness and peace.â And
                        the gnawing pain in the student's heart ceased: he grovelled no longer on
                        the floor of his chamber, wrestling with his despair, but looked upward to
                        the sky. It was still and clear, but all starless; and Leuthold thought it
                        was an image of his own future. As he looked, the horizon brightened, and
                        his tearless, burning eyes beheld the coming dawn. Then he knew that there
                        is no night so long and dreary but morning will come at last. The fountains
                        of his heart were unsealedâtears came, and they soothed him. He laid down,
                        and slept a sleep as calm as if angels watched around his pillow. It might
                        have been soâwho knows?</p>
                    <p>While many of the dwellers in Leipsic were yet sleeping, Leuthold Auerbach
                        went forth from his native town, as he resolved, for ever! He left kindly
                        tokens for all whom he regarded; but he bade farewell<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7020-251"></pb> to none. No one knew of his going until he had
                        departed; and he gave no clue as to whither he was journeying. Perhaps be
                        hardly knew himself; but he felt that he could not stay at Leipsic. A
                        restless desire for wandering took possession of him. He seemed as though he
                        could not breathe until he had shut out from his eyes, heart, and mind,
                        those scenes where he had been at once so happy and so wretchedâuntil he had
                        placed the wide world between him and his lost hope.</p>
                    <p>As before said, he went away without one adieu even to Hilda. He could not
                        look again upon her beloved face, knowing that all hope was lost for ever.
                        Against his reasonâalmost against his convictionâone faint ray had clung to
                        his heart during these long years of hidden love: all was dark now. Ere long
                        he knew that the total cessation of a flickering hope is far easiest to
                        bear,âat least after a time; but this truth he had yet to learn. Now, his
                        only strength seemed to consist in flying far away from the spectre of a
                        vanished joy.</p>
                    <p>Leuthold passed by the dwelling of Hilda, and his heart melted. In all his
                        agony was mingled no anger against her. She loved him not, but she had not
                        deceived him: he had beguiled himself. She was still the angel of his life,
                        the unconscious origin of all that was pure and good in his nature, the
                        awakener of his soul. Therein, her image shone unclouded still. In the
                        lonely sunshine of early morning, Leuthold stood by her garden-gate; he
                        pressed his lips to the cold stone where her hand had often rested in
                            their<pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7020-252"></pb> many adieux, and prayed that she
                        might be blessed through life, and happy in the love of him she had chosen.</p>
                    <p>While he lingered, he heard the trees rustling in the garden; a light
                        footstep sounded along the walks; and a low singing was heard, that seemed
                        to come from a heart overladen with its own happiness.</p>
                    <p>It was Hilda's voice. Leuthold could bear no more; he fled awayâfar, far, as
                        if his feet were winged. The dream of his youth was ended for ever.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">THE</hi> high mass of Easter was being celebrated in Haarlem
                        Cathedral. The deep-toned organ poured forth its volume of sound, the
                        censers gave out their incense, and the priests murmured the low monotonous
                        prayers of a religion whose mysterious beauty appeals to the heart, more
                        than to the understanding. The cathedral was filled with kneeling
                        worshippers of every rank. The rude boor from the Dutch marshes, but a few
                        degrees superior to his barbarian ancestor, of whom the refined Tacitus
                        scornfully writes; the rich citizen of Haarlem, who, contented with his
                        wealth and ignorance, left the duties of religion and learning<pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7020-253"></pb> to the priests of his faithâa faith which he
                        professed, but never attempted to comprehendâwere both there; and, lastly,
                        there were chance wanderers from all parts, who had come to witness the
                        Easter celebration, and to hear the great organ of Haarlem.</p>
                    <p>Of all that worshipping crowd we shall particularize but two individuals, who
                        knelt side by side, though chance alone had caused their propinquity, as
                        they were perfect strangers to each other. One was far advanced in life,
                        with phlegmatic, Dutch features, only redeemed from dulness by the acute
                        expression of a quick, dark eye: he wore a burgher's dress, goodly enough,
                        and carefully arranged. Beside him knelt the otherâa man, whose age might
                        have been within the middle cycle of lifeâfrom thirty to fifty. He had a
                        dark, bronzed countenance, remarkable neither for beauty nor ugliness; hair,
                        in which white streaks already had begun to mingle with the brown; and a
                        stooping gait. His careless but not coarse attire, was travel-worn, and he
                        worshipped like Jacob, âleaning on the top of his staff,â one which had
                        evidently sustained the wayfarer's steps through many a weary journey. He
                        rested his hands upon it as he knelt, leaned his head against them, and
                        seemed absorbed in thought. His musings were hardly devotional, for he fixed
                        his large soft eyes on vacancy, and his compressed lips did not move, though
                        all around him were heard the murmuring orisons of his fellow-worshippers.</p>
                    <p>When the sacred host was raised, the stranger's open<pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7020-254"></pb> eyes were still fixed upward; he declined not his
                        head; his neighbour touched his elbow, whispering</p>
                    <p>âMy good friend, thou art absorbed! thou forgettest thy prayers.â</p>
                    <p>The other turned hastily round, looked at the old burgher's kindly face, and,
                        with a murmured apology or acknowledgment, bent his head like the rest,
                        until the holy emblem had passed by. When the service concluded, the old man
                        said to his fellow-worshipperâ</p>
                    <p>âI pray you pardon me for breaking in upon your thoughts just now; but it
                        behoves all good Catholics to be doubly careful of every due rite, when
                        these sinful doctrines of the man John Huss are abroad.â</p>
                    <p>âI am beholden to you,â answered the stranger, in a sweet, musical voice. It
                        was the same which, years before, had rung with persuasive eloquence in the
                        hall of Leipzic; had murmured its quiet words of concealed love at Hilda's
                        side; had poured forth, in secret, its agony of wild despair. The stranger
                        in the cathedral of Haarlem was Leuthold Auerbach.</p>
                    <p>Touched and interestedâunconsciously, perhapsâby the melody of a voice that
                        was irresistible, the old man, as they went out together, still continued
                        the conversation.</p>
                    <p>âYou seem a stranger here?â</p>
                    <p>âI entered Haarlem only yesterday.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd you were admiring our cathedral? Is it not beautiful?â said the old man,
                        with some degree of pride.</p>
                    <pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7020-255"></pb>
                    <p>âIt is the fairest I have yet seen, and I have travelled far and wide, and
                        have found no rest for my feet,â continued Leuthold, musingly, while a sad
                        look passed over his face, not unmarked by his companion.</p>
                    <p>âForgive an old man's rudeness,â said the Dutchman, kindly; âbut you seem
                        weary, my friend; and if you are a stranger, and have no homeâno ties in
                        Haarlemââ</p>
                    <p>âNone in the wide world!â</p>
                    <p>âWhy, then, come home and stay with me, while your affairs detain you here.
                        Ours is a cheerful house; my Lucia will be sure to welcome her father's
                        guest; and I have half-a-dozen grandchildren, who will strive to amuse you.
                        You might fare worse than in the home of old Laurentius Coster.â</p>
                    <p>Leuthold met this unexpected hospitality with the cordiality it merited.</p>
                    <p>âBut, Herr Coster,â he said, smiling, âare you not rather venturesome in thus
                        welcoming a stranger to your house?â</p>
                    <p>âI know not who you may be, whether rich or poor, noble or peasant,â answered
                        the hearty burgher. âI only need look in your face to see you are a good
                        man, and that is all I care for. You are most welcome, provided you are not
                        one of those abominable heretics.â</p>
                    <p>Leuthold drew a crucifix from his bosom. âI am a good Catholic, I trust: as
                        indeed you have already witnessed. I was once a student, and am still a
                        humble follower of the learned sciences. My name is Leuthold Auerbach.â</p>
                    <p>âThen welcomeâthrice welcome!â cried <choice>
                            <orig>Lauren-</orig>
                            <reg>Laurentius</reg>
                        </choice><pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7020-256"></pb> tius, grasping him warmly by the
                        hand. âMy instinct was true! Sir, I am a simple, unlearned man myself, but I
                        have been honoured with the friendship of many of the wise and good. Your
                        name is known to me as that of one whom a prince might be proud to welcome
                        to his palace. Thrice welcome to my home, Herr Auerbach!â</p>
                    <p>Leuthold's breast thrilled with pleasure. The yearning desire for human
                        sympathy yet dwelt there, and ever sprang up at the lightest touch, a pure
                        fountain of love for all mankind. He had said to himself when, after the
                        desolation that fell upon him, his heart revived a little,âas a wayside
                        plant crushed by a heavy stone, after a time begins to put forth its small
                        green leaves from amidst the ruinsâhe had said, âI will be strong, I will be
                        patient. The world is very wide. I will not mourn for the loss of one
                        all-engrossing love; my heart shall not be frozen by this despair, but shall
                        abound the more in pure, unselfish, universal loveâin divine charity.â</p>
                    <p>And so he had wandered far and wide, in desert places, and among men whose
                        very existence was unknown to civilized Europe. He had gone from the learned
                        priests of Rome to the wild mountaineers of Hungary, and then again to the
                        scarcely less barbarian inhabitants of the nooks and corners of his own
                        German land. He had journeyed from city to city, everywhere following on the
                        track of misery with the footstep of an angel of peace, regarding his
                        learning only as an instrument of doing good. To<pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7020-257"></pb> the sick he was a physician; to the poor a
                        comforter and adviser; to the guilty he spoke with a warning, yet pitying
                        voice. When all these blessed him, when in their happiness he saw the fruit
                        of his labours, then Leuthold remembered no more his own sorrow, but
                        rejoiced that he was thus made an instrument of good on earth.</p>
                    <p>Laurentius and his guest took their way to the home of the former. As they
                        went, Coster talked with the not unpleasing garrulousness of age; and
                        Leuthold learned much of his new friend's early life. His father had been
                            <foreign xml:lang="lat">custos</foreign> of the cathedral; and this
                        office, after the fashion of those early times, had given to the family
                        their surname. Laurentius recounted to his guest the passing incidents of a
                        life whose course had been untroubled by any of those seasons of worldly
                        care and mental suffering, which often stand as landmarks of bitterness in
                        the history of finer moulded spirits. He had loved, in an easy, gentle,
                        indifferent way; he had married, and outlived joy; he had lost his wife, and
                        outlived sorrow. He spoke with a father's fondness of his only child, Lucia,
                        who, with her husband and children, brightened his home in his old age.</p>
                    <p>âI have had a comfortable life, and have done as much good as my
                        opportunities permitted,â said the old man. âLast of all, I am content that
                        my children should lay me in the shadow of the old cathedral towers, say a
                        prayer for my soul, and forget me.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd is this life? Is this all?â thought Leuthold,<pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7020-258"></pb> while he listened. âHave I no higher existence
                        than this?â And his inmost soul answered,ââYes, thou hast the true life
                        within thee!â He felt it, and was content. âYet,â he murmured, âthere is
                        none on earth even to say the prayer of loving kindred for my soul's
                        repose.â But the inward voice replied,ââWhat matters it? if thou hast worked
                        out thy mission on earth, thy good deeds, however secret, will be as thy
                        soul's children: who will yet rise up and bless their father.â</p>
                    <p>The dwelling of Laurentius Coster was situated on the shores of the lake of
                        Haarlem, whose waters dashed up almost to the entrance, fertilizing a
                        pleasant garden, which owed its beauty more to the hand of abundant Nature,
                        than to the tasteful skill of its cultivator. The house was evidently
                        occupied by a family whose wealth enabled them to consider luxury a
                        necessity, inasmuch as the window of the large hall was of glass, while the
                        other apertures for light were carefully covered with a thin wire-woven
                        substance. Moreover, it had one tall chimney in the centre of the roof,
                        above which the dense wood-smoke curled upwards, diffusing the pleasant
                        odour of burning pine-faggots; and the roughness of the outer walls was
                        concealed by festoons of ivy, which had been gracefully trained so as to
                        cover the whole front of the low, one-storied dwelling.</p>
                    <p>Presently the garden rang with the welcoming shouts of a troop of children,
                        who came bounding to meet their grandfather. The boys danced round him with
                        innumerable greetings and inquiries about Easter-<pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7020-259"></pb> gifts; while the eldest girlâa silent,
                        demure-eyed little damsel of twelve yearsâquietly took away the old man's
                        stick, and drew his arm through hers, making herself proud supporter of his
                        steps.</p>
                    <p>âSee what it is to be an old grandfather!â said Coster to Leuthold, who had
                        hung back from the merry tribe of children. âCome, Lucia the Second,â he
                        continued, addressing his granddaughter, âyou must be mistress of the house
                        in your mother's absence, and welcome my friend here, whom I have brought
                        from Haarlem.â</p>
                    <p>The little maiden drooped her head, and cast down her eyes, half shyly, half
                        with a childish coquetry; then, without lifting up her long eyelashes, she
                        put her hand in Leuthold's, and said,â</p>
                    <p>âYou are very welcome, and I hope you will stay a long time here.â</p>
                    <p>âThat will I gladly,â answered Leuthold, as he stooped down and kissed the
                        sweet, blushing face; and then, still holding Lucia's hand, he entered the
                        house of Laurentius with a feeling of home-happiness long unknown to the
                        lonely wanderer.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">WEEKS</hi>, months passed, and Leuthold of Leipsic still
                        remained an honoured guest in the family of Laurentius Coster. There was a
                        patriarchal simplicity therein which was most soothing to the spirit of the
                        wanderer. The children loved him, for he became alternately their teacher
                        and their playfellow; the motherâa worthy Dutch matron, to whom her home was
                        her whole worldâregarded him kindly, as a harmless, gentle personage, who
                        ate little and spoke less; and the old man himself, after vainly trying to
                        delight his own peculiar faculty of hero-worship by treating Leuthold with
                        the cumbrous respect due to a great man, at last suffered him to remain
                        unnoticed, and, unencumbered with the burden of his fame, nestle in the
                        family nook as he best loved.</p>
                    <p>When Leuthold spoke of continuing his journeyings, it was with a lingering
                        and almost sorrowful tone, which was echoed by all the family. John and
                        Peter, the two elder boys, loudly protested against his departure; and
                        little Lucia tearfully raised her soft dove's eyes, which had now learned<pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7020-261"></pb> to peep from under their lashes, even in
                        the presence of the great Herr Auerbach.</p>
                    <p>âDo you not love us, that you wish to go?â said the child, wistfully. âYou
                        know that we love youâI more than all. Why will you not stay?â</p>
                    <p>It is so sweet to hear the language of affection, even from a child.
                        Leuthold's eyes grew dim, while he took the gentle pleader on his knee.</p>
                    <p>âYou love me, dear child! Does any one then, love <emph>me</emph>?â</p>
                    <p>âAfter such a frank declaration from this young damsel, what more can you
                        wish?â said the grandfather, merrily. âBut come, Herr Auerbach, tell me
                        whither you would go, and whom it is that you prefer to us? I thought you
                        had no home-ties.â</p>
                    <p>âI have no closer ties in the wide world than here,â answered Leuthold. âIt
                        seems to be my fortune to drift through life like a chance sea-weed, and
                        never find a resting-place. I have been happy here, and now I go forth to
                        fulfil my wandering destiny.â</p>
                    <p>âThou shalt not go forth at all, my son,â cried the old man, his tone of
                        respect merging into that of affection. âListen to what this little maiden
                        says, and stay with us. If thou art too proud to be received as a brother in
                        a household which is honoured by thy presence, at least thou wilt not refuse
                        to aid in governing these wild boys, who ought to esteem it their greatest
                        happiness to have been instructed by the learned doctor Leuthold Auerbach.
                        Therefore stay, my son,âif I may call thee so.â</p>
                    <pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7020-262"></pb>
                    <p>Leuthold clasped the hand of Coster, and the compact was sealed, without a
                        word, save Lucia's joyful exclamationâ</p>
                    <p>âAh, now you will believe that we love you!â</p>
                    <p>And she sat down at his feet, looking up in his face with eyes that spoke
                        more than her wordsâeyes in which a woman's soul was dawning through the
                        unconscious innocence of the child.</p>
                    <p>âHerr Auerbach,â said the eldest boy, after a long and whispered
                        consultation, ânow you are one of the family, we must put your name among
                        our list of carvings. How do you spell âLeuthold?ââ</p>
                    <p>His question being answered, the boy began to consult with his brothers.</p>
                    <p>âAn L and an H,â mused the younger, John; âthey will be hard to cut.
                        Grandfather, you must cut them for us, as you did in the tree.â</p>
                    <p>And he brought out a large box filled with letters of all sizes rudely carved
                        in bark, some separately, others united in long strips, forming the names of
                        the family.</p>
                    <p>âNow you shall see how cleverly we can write without using a pen, and what a
                        quantity we can do at a time,â said Peter. âCome, dear master!â The âgood
                        master,â or the âdear master,â was Leuthold's appellation in the family.</p>
                    <p>The boy led him to a rude sort of press, and showed him how, by placing these
                        blackened letters upon white paper, impressions were taken of the names of
                        the household.</p>
                    <pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7020-263"></pb>
                    <p>âWe call this our printing,â said the boy, proudly, as he noticed Leuthold's
                        surprise and curiosity. âWe have done all our own names, and you shall soon
                        see yours write itself in the same way. Once we did a whole sentenceâit was,
                            <foreign xml:lang="lat">Ave Maria, ora pro nobis</foreign>: it looked so
                        pretty.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd who found out these curious playthings?â asked the âgood master.â</p>
                    <p>âIt was our grandfather who cut the first letter for us to copy out of the
                        bark of a beech-tree, as we were walking in the wood. Then Peter took an
                        impression of it, and we saw how it would save the trouble of writing, and
                        be much prettier. But you do not bear, good master,â said the boy, as
                        Leuthold sat musingly with the letters in his hand, apparently absorbed in
                        deep reflection.</p>
                    <p>In the child's plaything the man of thought and far-seeing intellect
                        perceived, though dimly, the origin of a mighty power, which in coming ages
                        would sway the world to its centre. He saw how learning might be scattered
                        far and wideâhow the work of a lifetime might come to be transcribed in a
                        dayâand thus the blessing of knowledge be diffused to an extent of which he
                        had never before dreamed. These possibilities, though vague, came upon the
                        man of science with a force which he could feel, but not define. A sudden
                        light flashed upon Leuthold, impelling him to work out the great idea which
                        had arisen out of one of those strange accidents which we call chance, but
                        which are destiny.</p>
                    <pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7020-264"></pb>
                    <p>Laurentius Coster was one of those men who seem sent into the world, the
                        unconscious instruments of some great good, yet who never dream of their
                        mission, and accomplish it more through seeming fate than by the resolute
                        agency of their own will. How little did the simple-minded old man imagine,
                        when cutting out playthings for his grandchildren, that he was paving the
                        way for the glorious footsteps of freedom, of science, of literature;âthat
                        the name which, in his unlearned humility, he deemed would soon be
                        forgotten, was to be transmitted from generation to generation as that of
                        the inventor of printing.</p>
                    <p>Leuthold Auerbach spent a long night of meditation, and then he sought
                        Laurentius, and told him, with earnest enthusiasm, of what was passing in
                        his mind. But the placid and rather phlegmatic Dutchman was perfectly
                        unmoved. He could not believe that from a thing so triflingâa childish
                        toyâshould spring effects so great as Leuthold foretold. The master drew him
                        to the window.</p>
                    <p>âLook,â he cried in his energy, âlook at that noble tree, in whose branches
                        the birds rest and the breezes playâit was once a small seed trodden under
                        foot! But a hand found it, planted it, and behold it now! So is the
                        beginning of every new science; it is discoveredâa tiny seed, planted,
                        sometimes intentionally, sometimes by what men foolishly call âchance;â it
                        takes root and grows, and none can hinder it. Remember that a few grains of
                        sand <choice>

                        the fire by a careless workman's hand produced the clear, beautiful
                        substance now forming your window; and who knows where the marvels of this
                        art of glass-making may end? It makes things distinct to the eye like a new
                        sense. Perchance, one day through it we may behold the far-off mysteries of
                        the stars. And so it will be with this discovery of thine, Laurentius.â</p>
                    <p>âThou art sanguine, dear Leuthold,â said the old man, with a half-incredulous
                        but gentle smile, as he listened to the excited tones of his friend. âWhat
                        good dost thou imagine this printing will produce?â</p>
                    <p>âHast thou never considered that it will multiply writing without end?âthat
                        those rare and precious works which it takes a man's life to copy may be
                        made no longer the sole luxury of the rich?âthat the same power by which
                        these children print a name or a prayer could be made to produce a whole
                        volume? Oh, Laurentius, if thou couldst see into the future as I doâsee thy
                        name emblazoned by fameâsee thy children honoured, and, above all, see the
                        good which thou hast left behind on earth! How blessed such a life must be!â</p>
                    <p>Coster, moved and touched by the earnestness of Leuthold, seemed more than
                        half convinced.</p>
                    <p>âWell, dear master, what dost thou wish me to do for the furtherance of this
                        great end? I will do all for thy sake.â</p>
                    <p>âNot for mine, but thine ownâor, rather for the<pb n="263" xml:id="VAB7020-266"></pb> sake of the whole world!â cried the enthusiastic
                        philosopher.</p>
                    <p>And then he explained to his surprised and wondering hearer various plans
                        which the ingenuity of a man of science could make applicable to the new
                        invention.</p>
                    <p>âIt is strangeâit is wonderful!â said Laurentius, musing, as improvements
                        which had never struck him before were suggested by the master; and slowly
                        the idea began to dawn upon the good Fleming that this passing amusement of
                        his might indeed turn out a wonderful discovery. He was like a man who had
                        picked up a pebble, which some hand more skilful than his own had polished,
                        and found therein a precious gem. Yet, like the same self-gratified seeker,
                        he never remembered that he had only found it as a common stone, and that,
                        for all he knew of its value, it might have remained a common stone for
                        ever, had not a wiser head than his own brought the treasure to light.</p>
                    <p>Laurentius gave himself up to delight and pride. He was at last convinced of
                        the after-success of his discovery, and as it steadily advanced, owing to
                        the skilful wisdom of Leuthold, the learned of Haarlem began to see it too.
                        Coster was now honoured as the inventor of a marvellous art, and men began
                        to talk of him as the honest burgher had never been talked of before. When
                        the first rudely-printed book appeared, the joy of the old man knew no
                        bounds. He looked at it, turned over and over again the coarsely-formed<pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7020-267"></pb> but still legible pages, until his aged
                        eyes swam with tears.</p>
                    <p>âCan it be IâI, Laurentius Coster, who have done all this,âwho have found out
                        what seems like magic?â cried he.</p>
                    <p>And then he embraced his daughter, and took his grandchildren on his knee,
                        making them spell it over letter by letter.</p>
                    <p>âMy boys, my dear John and Peter,â he said, âI am old: I shall not live to
                        rejoice in the work of my hands; but you will see it. Yes, my children, you
                        will not forget your old grandfather when he is goneâthe world will not
                        suffer you. Ah, me! to think that my poor name should indeed be remembered
                        for ages as having done all this! Children, you will one day be proud that
                        you are descended from Laurentius Coster.â</p>
                    <p>âGrandfather,â murmured Lucia, âyou are so happy with us that you forget
                        Leuthold. See how silent and grave he stands.â</p>
                    <p>âAh, yes! come here, my dear Leutholdâmy good friend,â cried the old man,
                        whose heart was opened to the whole world. âYou were the first to tell me
                        what I had done, and you shall not be forgotten. You shall share my fortune
                        with these children, and be a rich man all your life!â</p>
                    <p>Leuthold smiled, with a gentle negative motion of the head; he then
                        complained of weariness, and retired. In his solitude he sat, and pondered
                        over thoughts half-pleasing, half-sad.</p>
                    <pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7020-268"></pb>
                    <p>âIt is even so,â mused he. âI have laboured, and others will reap the fruit
                        of my labours. This old man's name will be honoured, while mine will be
                        mentioned no more. I shall pass away like a wandering breeze, or like a
                        breaking wave. Yet what matters it? The winged breeze has left behind it a
                        precious seedâthe wave has wafted a pearl ashore. The work of both is
                    done.â</p>

                        and yet wearyâa changing day. They call Time an enemy, a destroyer: at times
                        a beloved friend, but that is only in the bitter irony of sorrow. The fact
                        is, that passing Life and changing Time are only outward show. The true
                        souls who walk the earth,âand there are many, thank God! whatever
                        cold-hearted sceptics may say of humanityânever really change, nor grow old.
                        They only ripen in wisdom and in all good things, and become more fit for

                        weighs down the mind, and the heart grows old with the frame; but the true
                        angel-spirits are ever young.</p>
                    <p>Thus Leuthold Auerbach, when the ominous shadow of forty years was nigh
                        overtaking him, was as young in heart as he had been at twenty-five. His eye
                        yet brightened at the sight of all beautiful things; his voice had its old
                        gentle tone; and though his figure was bent still lower, and Time, the
                        enemy, had laid his hand on the noble forehead and clustering hair, until
                        every curve of the finely-formed head was bare to the eye of the observer,
                        still Leuthold Auerbach was not an old man. Nature, ever even-handed,
                        sometimes atones to those whose want of beauty makes them look old in youth,
                        by tenderly keeping off the harsher tokens of age. Had the Self-seer
                        exercised his gift, now long unused, he would have marvelled that fifteen
                        years should have passed over him and left so few traces behind.</p>
                    <p>The âgood masterââhe still kept that nameâsat one day with his pupils, now
                        growing into manhood. John and Peter were busily engaged in carving types,
                        for all the secrets of his invention were wisely kept by Laurentius within
                        his own family. They were the sole depositaries of the first mysteries of
                        printing, except a servant, Geinsfleicht, who afterwards carried the secret
                        with him to Mentz, and there promulgated it as his own discovery. The old
                        man wandered up and down the room: now looking over the young workmen, now
                        giving, orders to his servant, who was<pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7020-270"></pb>
                        busy with the press, and then glancing with pride and pleasure to the
                        various testimonies of his success that adorned the room, in the shape of
                        printed leaves.</p>
                    <p>â'Tis useless, grandfather,â at last cried John, throwing down his block, âI
                        cannot cut these letters; and as I am the best workman here, no one else
                        can. You must get some wood-carver, and run the chance of his keeping our
                        secret. I will be troubled no longer.â</p>
                    <p>âAh, you were ever an impatient boy,â said the grandfather, shaking his head
                        in despair. âLeuthold, dear master, what shall we do?â</p>
                    <p>âThe boy speaks wisely, though be meant it not,â answered Leuthold. âThe work
                        is beyond his skillâit requires an experienced hand.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd whom among the carvers in Haarlem can we trust?âthey are a wild,
                        unprincipled set, who would steal our secret and fly. Come, Lucia,â he
                        continued, as the door opened, and a young girl entered, âthou hast more
                        sense than either of thy brothers; tell us how we are to get this work
                        finished, which John has so angrily given up?â</p>
                    <p>Lucia raised her eyes with the same look which was peculiar to her in
                        childhood: all else was changed with her. The round, chubby features had
                        become more regular; the form had reached the full height of womanhood;
                        childish prettiness was merged into beautyâbeauty rendered still more
                        loveable by the mind that shone through it. Lucia at seventeen was, indeed,
                        the perfection of girlhood; thoughtful, serene, yet with a world of feeling
                        that almost amounted to<pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7020-271"></pb> passion,
                        slumbering in the deep blue eyes, in the tremulous lips.</p>
                    <p>âI do not wonder that John could not carve this delicate work,â she said.</p>
                    <p>âAy, that is the thing! and whom can we trust, my child? A first-rate carver
                        would refuse the task, and of those wild young men that Peter brings here,
                        there is not one who is honest.â</p>
                    <p>âYes, grandfather, there is,â answered the girl. âNo one can speak evil of
                        George Surlan, the woodcarver from Ulin.â</p>
                    <p>âWhat! merry George, the Master-singer, who steals away old hearts and young
                        with his laughing eyes and his gay ditties?â</p>
                    <p>âHe is good as well as merry, grandfather. I am sure you might trust him. And
                        he is a favourite of the master's, too,â said Lucia, for the first time
                        lifting her eyes to Leuthold's face.</p>
                    <p>The two boys burst into a loud laugh.</p>
                    <p>âYou like George because he took your head as a model for one of his carved
                        angels, sister. How vain girls are!â cried John, maliciously.</p>
                    <p>Lucia glanced towards the master, whose penetrating gaze was fixed on her
                        countenance. She saw it, and blushed deeply.</p>
                    <p>âIt is not so, indeed!â she murmured. âYou must not think so ill of me.â And
                        she suddenly took Leuthold's hand with a child-like air, as if deprecating
                        reproach.</p>
                    <p>âLucia is never vain,â said Leuthold, gently, as he<pb n="269" xml:id="VAB7020-272"></pb> drew her towards him with the frank familiarity
                        which ever marked his intercourse with the whole family, and smoothed her
                        beautiful fair hair, as a father or elder brother might have done. It was a
                        token of regard that was customary between them; and yet Lucia seemed to
                        tremble and change colour, even while a smile of radiant happiness hovered
                        round her lips.</p>
                    <p>âMerry George might have known we were talking about him,â cried John, who
                        had taken refuge at the window, in a sullen fit. âLook, there he is, coming
                        hither! Now, grandfather, you can put him in my place, as Lucia answers for
                        his honesty so boldly.â</p>
                    <p>âWhat shall we do, good friend?â said the old man, irresolutely, turning to
                        Leuthold, who was, though Laurentius never suspected the fact, the ruler of
                        all his actions, having over him the inevitable influence of a strong mind
                        over a weak one.</p>
                    <p>âI think,â said the master, âthat George would answer thy purpose,
                        Laurentius. Lucia has spoken truly; he is a clever and honest youth, the son
                        of a worthy father, whom I once knew well. Thou mayst indeed trust him.â</p>
                    <p>âThe master is always right. I will go and fetch George hither,â said Peter;
                        and meeting no opposition, he departed.</p>
                    <p>Presently George Surlan entered. He was a youth slenderly and gracefully
                        formed, which caused him to look much younger than he really was. His dress
                        was that of a student, but light and gay, and he wore on his shoulder a sort
                        of badge, being a rude representation of<pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7020-273"></pb>
                        King David playing the harp. This was the distinctive mark of the order of
                        Master-singers, a brotherhood which rose up in Germany after the
                        Minne-singers had passed away, and which united the musical character of the
                        latter with many rules and rites approaching to masonic. To this fraternity
                        of minstrels, which included men of all ranks, and was at one time almost
                        universal over Germany, the young wood-carver belonged.</p>
                    <p>The Master-singer lifted his cap from his fair curls, and looked with much
                        surprise round the room, which was, according to report, the scene of
                        Coster's mysterious and secret labours. He made a respectful reverence to
                        the old man, and to Leuthold, and then, as his quick eye caught that of the
                        young maiden, it brightened with pleasure.</p>
                    <p>âThey tell me you are a true upright youth, as well as a good carver,â
                        abruptly began Laurentius. âI have sent for you to aid us, George Surlan,
                        and I am going to trust you with a great secret. Herr Auerbach says I may.â</p>
                    <p>The young man looked gratefully towards the master, and repliedâ</p>
                    <p>âHe shall have no cause to repent his goodness. What can I do?â</p>
                    <p>And thereupon Laurentius began, in a long harangue, to explain the necessity
                        of secresy, and the solemn promise that he would be expected to make
                        regarding the work he was to do. The Master-singer listened rather
                        impatiently; but Leuthold took advantage of a pause in the discourse to
                        explain all succinctly.</p>
                    <pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7020-274"></pb>
                    <p>âThou must promise to keep the secret, and I know thou didst never fail in
                        thy word. I answer for thee, and so does this child it seems,â said
                        Leuthold, smiling at Lucia.</p>
                    <p>âThen I will engage to do anything in the wide world,â cried George Surlan,
                        earnestly, clasping the master's hand, though his beaming eyes sought the
                        sweet face of Lucia.</p>
                    <p>She answered him with a frank and kindly smile; but she did not droop her
                        long lashesâshe did not blush. Alas! while the young man's whole soul was
                        laid at her feetâwhile he watched her every movement with the lingering
                        fondness that only springs from love, she looked carelessly on him,
                        unconscious of the treasure thus thrown away. To the dreaming maiden, wholly
                        absorbed in her inner world of romance, there was but one on earth who
                        appeared noble, wise, worthy to be the ideal of girlhood's wildest devotion.
                        That one was Leuthold Auerbach.</p>
                    <p>Woman's love is far more spiritualized than man's, inasmuch as it is often
                        entirely independent of outward beauty. A true-hearted woman's nature is
                        full of the quality called hero-worship, and this, mingled with the
                        all-pervading necessity of loving, causes her to be swayed irresistibly by
                        the power of superior intellect. How many a fanciful girl has lavished a
                        world of fondness upon some poet-idol, whom perhaps her eyes have never
                        beheld, and whom yet she regards with a vague adoration, which, though only
                        ideal, needs but a touch to exalt it into the intensity of human<pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7020-275"></pb> love! How often, too, do we see some beautiful
                        and high-minded woman pour out the whole riches of her affection upon one to
                        whom Nature has given nothing but the great spell to win it allâa noble
                        soul! She passes over all external disadvantages of age or person. She sees
                        but the immortal spirit dwelling therein; and it is ever beautiful, ever
                        young. Her soul is bowed down before it in joyful humility; and where she
                        worships she loves too, with an earnestness, intensity, and purity, which
                        shadow dimly forth that which the angels bear to Divinity itself.</p>
                    <p>Therefore let it not be thought strange if Leuthold had thus unconsciously
                        awakened such deep and absorbing feelings in the heart of a young girl like
                        Lucia. The world scoffs at the romance of girlhood. Nay, women themselves,
                        grown sedate and matronly, come in time to look back deridingly on
                        themselves, and say how young and foolish they were once. And yet this first
                        fresh dream is one of the few realities of life, not the less vivid and true
                        because we outgrow it in time. Others treading after us, again pass through
                        that sunny region, and when we turn and see them with their innocent romance
                        and their single-hearted trust, we remember our own old days, and think that
                        there was some truth in those dreams after all.</p>
                    <p>Sweet, maidenly, and yet high-souled Lucia, with the heart of a woman and the
                        spirit of a child, our eyes grow dim while we picture thee: how thou didst
                        grow up like a pure lily among meaner flowers, and feel<pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7020-276"></pb> gradually the carelessness of childhood merge
                        into the dreams of girlhood; how thou didst love to sit alone, to trace dim
                        regions in cloudland, to listen to invisible music in the wind, to watch the
                        stars, until they seemed mysterious eyes looking down on thee, while vague
                        feelings of delicious sadness stole over thee, and thy tears flowed, though
                        not for sorrow! Poor child! who didst ask of the winds, the clouds, the
                        stars, what was the strange power that so moved thee, and understoodest not
                        the answer that they bore,ââMaiden, it is Love!â</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">THE</hi> story of love is everywhere the same. Why should we
                        enlarge on the passing daily events in this Flemish home of four hundred
                        years ago? Human hearts beat now as they did then, and are alike swayed by
                        doubts, and fears, and hopes, with love reigning above all. Thou, youth of
                        modern days, sighing in vain for some cold-hearted damsel; thou, dreaming
                        maiden, who worshippest one above all, calling this feeling respect,
                        admirationâanything but love; and thou, calm philosopher, who hast suffered
                        and found peace, and art no more of the world,âye may see in these visions
                        of the past but the reflex of your own selves.</p>
                    <pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7020-277"></pb>
                    <p>Day after day glided on, and all was outward calm in the dwelling of
                        Laurentius Coster. The young Master-singer became an inmate of the family,
                        and all were glad of this. George Surlan brought sunshine wherever he went,
                        with his blithe spirit and kindly heart. He was not one of your moody,
                        sentimental lovers, always sighing and pining; still less was he addicted to
                        those fantastic moods which modern poetry has made so interesting, ever
                        changing from gloomy misanthropy to hollow mirth. Though he loved Lucia as
                        the apple of his eye, and though as yet he loved in vain, still he did not
                        lose hope. It was his happiness to be near her, to render her all those
                        kindly offices which brothers scorn. When she walked through her well-tended
                        garden and received the daily gift of flowers, or found all sorts of
                        beautifully carved ornaments in her room, as if by magic, Lucia thanked her
                        friend with a pleasant smile, never dreaming in her innocence of the love he
                        bore her. Poor George! he tried to be contented with such a light guerdon,
                        and consoled himself with the thought that perhaps Lucia was too young to
                        love any one, and a still untouched heart might surely be won in time; but,
                        after a season, he learned how vain was that comfort. Thus it chanced that
                        the discovery came.</p>
                    <p>Usually, in the long winter evenings, the family gathered together in the
                        large hall. Very solemn these meetings had used to be, while Laurentius held
                        forth to the sleepy children on the events of his young days, intermingled
                        with horrible modern stories of the<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7020-278"></pb> deeds
                        of Ziska and John Huss, whose histories had reached the good city of Haarlem
                        with all the embellishments of a fairy tale. When Leuthold came, these
                        stories were discontinued, and, in their stead, the master's low sweet voice
                        might be heard, telling various tales learned in his journeyings far and
                        wide, of good deeds done in humble homes, of noble heroism that the world
                        knew not, of suffering endured and wrong overcomeâall that could lead young
                        spirits onward in the right path. At such times the little Lucia always sat
                        at Leuthold's feet, with his hand resting on her curls; and, as she grew
                        older, she still kept her place beside him. But the soft eyes were less
                        often raised to his face, and she usually listened in silence, her fingers
                        busied with some piece of maiden's work. Now and then, when Leuthold turned
                        and saw her thus, a vision of the long-vanished past flitted across his
                        mind; but when, at a sudden pause in the tale, he saw the enthusiastic girl
                        listening with clasped hands and heaving breast, the passing fancy vanished.
                        Lucia was not the calm, reserved Hilda. More beautifulâperchance more
                        winning: but unlike that ideal of his youth's love.</p>
                    <p>When, alternating with Leuthold's stories, came the fantastic lays of the
                        young Master-singer, Lucia at first did not like the change; but gradually,
                        as the musician's own feelings deepened, his songs took a serious tone. His
                        mirthful ditties were transformed into the breathing of love, a lore new as
                        pleasant to the maiden; for Lelthold, in all his histories, never touched on
                        that one subject. How could he? So while the minstrel poured<pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7020-279"></pb> out his feelings under a thin veil, his strains
                        touched Lucia, and she listened with an intense interest, which gave new
                        inspiration to the Master-singer.</p>
                    <p>One night George sang an old German tale:</p>
                    <p>âThere was once a young princess, whom many kings and knights wooed. It was
                        in the ancient times of Scandinavian warfare, when the strongest arm and the
                        fiercest spirit were highest esteemed by men. Some of her suitors brought
                        precious furs, and laid them at her feet in token of their prowess in the
                        chase; others came in their bright ringing armour, and showed her treasures
                        of gold; and a few cast before her, with fierce looks, the heads of slain
                        enemies, to be the footstool of a conqueror's bride. But when the maiden
                        turned away from all, their love grew into anger, and they all joined in
                        hate towards the king her father, and would have driven him from his throne.
                        Then there stood before the crownless king a counsellor of whom no one had
                        dreamed,âa poor and wise man, who had dwelt in the palace all his days
                        unnoticed and uncared for, and he said to the monarch,â</p>
                    <p>ââMy hand is feeble, and has never grasped a spear, yet I can tell the stars
                        in their courses. My voice is low, it has never been heard in battle, yet it
                        can teach men wisdom. My body is frail, but I have strength in my soul. Let
                        me go forth among thy people, and teach them how to overcome the might of
                        the enemy.â</p>
                    <p>âThen the wise man went forth, and his words were like thunders, and he ruled
                        the hearts of men<pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7020-280"></pb> at his will, until the
                        foe was conquered and the land was at rest. The king said unto him,â</p>
                    <p>ââThou shalt have the reward which is greatest of all; thou shalt be my son,
                        O poor wise man!â</p>
                    <p>âBut the other answered,â</p>
                    <p>ââHow can it be? I am lowly in form; my youth is gone by; I have neither
                        strength to fight, nor beauty to win love. The princess will not cast her
                        eyes on me.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd he looked sorrowfully to where the throned maiden sat in her loveliness,
                        as one would look at the sphered moon, in hopeless adoration. Then the
                        princess came down from her seat; her breast heaved, her cheek burned, but
                        it was not with pride; and she said softly to him,â</p>
                    <p>ââThou art very wise, but thou knowest not the secrets of a woman's heart.
                        When the strong men came and laid their tributes before me, I thought of a
                        voice that had taught me in my childhood; and I turned from them as from the
                        warring beasts of the field. When the noble and beautiful bent before me, a
                        face was in my sight more dear than all. Dost thou know my heart now?â And
                        when he gazed, dumb and pale as death with overpowering joy, the maiden laid
                        her arms round his neck and whispered, âLet me love thee, thou noblest of
                        all. If thou art poor, I will be thy riches; if thou art growing old, I will
                        bring back thy youth. To me thou art all fair, all young; thou art my glory,
                        my delight, my pride!â'</p>
                    <p>The minstrel paused in his song, and glanced at<pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7020-281"></pb> Lucia. She satâher head bent forward, her
                        quivering lips pale with emotion, and her eyes fixed with a look full of the
                        deepest and most adoring loveânot, alas! on him who sang, butâon Leuthold!
                        In another moment she had burst into tears, and fled from the room.</p>
                    <p>âThou shouldst not sing such doleful ballads to poor simple maidens, George,â
                        said Laurentius, reproachfully. âDoubtless the child was terrified at thy
                        horrible tales of war and battle and human heads as footstools. 'T is very
                        wrong; is it not, Leuthold?â</p>
                    <p>The master lifted up his head; he, too, had listened with a moved heart to
                        the tale of loveâit had spoken to him of the long-buried, mournful past.
                        George Surlan noticed that his face was paler than ordinary, and that tears
                        glistened on his eyelashes. The young lover's bosom was rent with jealousy.
                        He dashed his instrument to the floor, and went out into the garden.</p>
                    <p>âNow that boy is angry, too,â querulously cried old Laurentius. âWhat must be
                        done with these wild young spirits? Go after him, dear Leuthold, and bring
                        him hither again.â</p>
                    <p>But George would not come. The master found him walking hastily by the side
                        of the lake. His anger had passed away, but was succeeded by sadness. It sat
                        strangely enough on that bright face, hitherto full of the unclouded gaiety
                        of youth. Leuthold was touched to the heart: in a moment he penetrated the
                        young man's love-secret; and his tone, which he had<pb n="279" xml:id="VAB7020-282"></pb> meant to make calm and severe, now grew gentle
                        and almost tremulous in its sympathy.</p>
                    <p>âWhat ails thee, George?â he said, laying his hand on the Master-singer's
                        arm. âWhy wert thou angry, and why art thou now so sad?â</p>
                    <p>âIt is nothingânothing! Let me alone!â and George turned away angrily; but he
                        met the calm, earnest eyes of Leuthold, and the storm was lulled. âLeave me,
                        good master; I will return to the house soon.â</p>
                    <p>But Leuthold still kept his hold, and spoke gently and gravely,â</p>
                    <p>âGeorge Sarlan, when I stood by thy father's deathbed at Ulm, he prayed me to
                        watch over thee, and told thee always to listen to my words. Dear George,
                        wilt thou hear me, when I tell thee what I read in thy heart now?â</p>
                    <p>The brow of the Master-singer crimsoned, but he said nothing. Leuthold went
                        on:â</p>
                    <p>âThou hast a secret there. Thou art wroth at the careless words of
                        Laurentius, because thou lovest our sweet Lucia.â</p>
                    <p>â<emph>Our</emph> sweet Lucia!â repeated the young man, bitterly. âYes, I do
                        love Luciaâthy Lucia!â</p>
                    <p>âI have thought soâI have wished soâand I am sure she loves thee,â answered
                        Leuthold, unconscious of the other's meaning.</p>
                    <p>âThou art very generous, master. Why art thou so certain of the maiden's
                        heart?â</p>
                    <p>âDoes she not always smile upon thee? Did she<pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7020-283"></pb> not weep at thy song? I saw not her face, but I knew it was so. Surely
                        she loves thee, George?â</p>
                    <p>âOh, dear master, have pity on me; thou wilt drive me mad.!â cried the other,
                        impetuously. âThou wert ever kind; why dost thou taunt me thus? Lucia loves
                        me not, and thou knowest it too well.â</p>
                    <p>âNay! Whom but thee could this timid maiden love, who has been brought up
                        like a young bird in its hidden nest?â</p>
                    <p>âTheeâthee, Leuthold Auerbach. Lucia loves thee!â</p>
                    <p>The red blood rushed to the master's face, and then faded away into a
                        mournful smile.</p>
                    <p>âThou art dreaming, poor boy!â he said, gently. âThroughout life I have never
                        known the blessing of woman's love: it was not for me! and now that I am
                        growing old, that this fair blooming child should love one like meâseest
                        thou not it is impossible?â</p>
                    <p>George looked amazed.</p>
                    <p>âAnd can it be that thou knewest it not?âthat thou dost not love her?â</p>
                    <p>âI love my sweet pupil, who has been unto me like a young sisterâa daughter!
                        I never had a dream so wild as this.â</p>
                    <p>âThen thou lovest another, or thou hast loved. Tell me all, dear master,â
                        eagerly cried the young man. But he imagined not the effect his words would
                        produce on Leuthold, who staggered as if struck by a sudden blow, and leaned
                        against a tree for support. George Surlan, terrified and awed, could not
                            utter<pb n="281" xml:id="VAB7020-284"></pb> a word. At last the master said
                        slowly, and with effort,â</p>
                    <p>âSpeak of this no more. Let it vanish alike from thy memory and from thy
                        tongue. It is a secret between my own heart and God. Now leave me.â</p>
                    <p>The young musician, deeply touched, pressed his hand and departed. Leuthold
                        stood alone by the shore of the gloomy lake. A thick mist had crept over it;
                        the chill penetrated every fibre of his slight, delicate frame, but he felt
                        it not. The long-slumbering feelings of human passion had once more awoke in
                        him, and he trembled beneath their power. His soul was an autumn tree,
                        through whose boughs the same breezes which had once only produced pleasant
                        music, now pass,âtearing to the earth the same leaves with which they had
                        erst harmlessly played. The ideal of love which he had vainly set up in
                        youth again revived in Leuthold's spirit. Not that another filled the place
                        of Hilda, but his soul thrilled to the sweetness of being for the first time
                        the object of woman's love.</p>
                    <p>The words of George Surlan, âLucia loves theeâonly thee,â rang in the ears of
                        Leuthold with a strange melody. He began to think over the words, the looks
                        of the young maiden, since she had grown from childhood unto girlhood; her
                        unvarying tenderness; her silent attention to all his comforts, even to the
                        commonest things; her care for all things he loved; the deep sympathy,
                        mingled with reverence, with which she strove to teach her own mind to
                        follow his in its<pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7020-285"></pb> wildest flights. All
                        these things dawned upon him in a new light, with a sweetness of which he
                        was himself hardly conscious.</p>
                    <p>Oh, ye lonely-hearted ones, into whose darkness has suddenly broken a
                        cheering rayâon whom the unlooked-for sense of being loved has stolen like a
                        pleasant perfume in the desertâdeem him not faithless to the one only true
                        love that the human heart can feel! Scorn him not, if in Leuthold's dreams
                        that night the bitter memories of the past grew less keen; that the forms of
                        Hilda, the hopelessly beloved one, and of Lucia, the young, devoted dreamer,
                        mingled into one.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">LONG</hi> ere the twilight of a winter morning dawned, Leuthold
                        arose, and, lighting his lamp, strove to banish by study the wayward
                        fantasies of the night. But it was in vain. A haunting spirit had been
                        raised within him which no such power could lay. His thoughts turned still
                        to that hope of Lucia's love which had so suddenly risen up in his
                        imagination. To drive it<pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7020-286"></pb> away he thought
                        of himselfâof the twenty years' barrier between that fair young maiden and
                        the man over whom time and sorrow had laid such a heavy hand. But still the
                        moaning wind seemed to breathe, in Lucia's voice, the words of that old
                        layââLet me love thee, and I will bring back thy youth.â</p>
                    <p>Again, as in a time long gone by, there came to Leuthold the wild yearning to
                        behold himselfâto exercise the strange gift which had once so strongly
                        influenced his life. The angel of his destiny seemed once more near him, and
                        thoughts and feelings deadened during his life of action in the world
                        without, again thronged upon the mind of the dreamer. The Self-seer felt
                        upon him the warning of his coming power.</p>
                    <p>âO thou Ruler of my fate!â cried Leuthold, âthou readest my heartâall its
                        weakness, all its strength. Thou seest that it is not through vain desire or
                        selfish pride that I seek to know myself as I am. It might be that my
                        desolate heart would be gladdened and grow young in the sunshine of woman's
                        love; a wife's hand might smooth away the furrows of this brow; children's
                        kisses bring back the roses of these pale lips; I might yet live the life I
                        pictured in youth's dreams, and die at peace in my own household! But if
                        not, oh, let me understand my own spirit, and do that which is right in the
                        sight of the Spirit who governs all.â</p>
                    <p>As the Self-seer, in the earnestness of his concentrated soul, prayed thus,
                        the lamp died away and his chamber grew dark. The wind rose, and the waves
                            of<pb n="284" xml:id="VAB7020-287"></pb> the lake under his window gave
                        forth a hollow murmur which lulled his senses. Gradually torpor oppressed
                        him, and he felt no more, until in the misty daylight the divided soul
                        beheld its other Self, wrapped in the peaceful, child-like repose, into
                        which Leuthold had sunk when the spell came upon him.</p>
                    <p>Once more, after a lapse of time which on earth would be numbered as the
                        fourth of a man's life, the shadowy Essence looked upon its bodily formâthe
                        immortal and unchangeable spirit beheld what was perishable as the flowers
                        of the field. Even as we view a fading garment did the Presence look upon
                        the lineaments of its earthly being. The face was not yet disfigured by age,
                        because evil passions had never stained it; but the freshness of youth was
                        not there. Even greater than the tokens of natural decay were the signs of
                        quick-coming decline produced by the restlessness of the ever-active mind.
                        When once age came it would not be with slow crawl, but with lightning
                        footstep.</p>
                    <p>As the low red sunbeam fell on his face, Leuthold awoke. The Shadow followed
                        him as he descended to the general hall. His step grew firm, and a
                        brightness was in his eye that resembled the student of Leipsic in years
                        gone by. George Surlan met the master, with a silent, expressive grasp of
                        the hand, and an affectionate, inquiring gaze; but as Leuthold, with a
                        passing answer, turned away from him, the Phantom read in his troubled air
                        the conflict that had already begun in that soul, hitherto so calm, so<pb n="285" xml:id="VAB7020-288"></pb> clear; and a painful thrill quivered
                        through its pure and spiritual being.</p>
                    <p>When Lucia, timidly, and yet with inconceivable tenderness, took the master's
                        hand, she was startled by the earnestness of his look. It betrayed a sudden
                        awakening to the power of her beauty, a something of passion for the woman
                        mingled with affection towards the child. That day she did not linger at her
                        place by Leuthold's side, but went away to the farthest nook, though she
                        felt that his eyes followed her even there. The Spirit saw it too, and
                        mourned that its bodily eyes could no longer meet those of the young
                        wood-carver, who plied his work in silence and hopeless pain.</p>
                    <p>As the day advanced Leuthold grew more restless. He went to the shore of the
                        lake and wandered about, sometimes idly watching the dusky clouds that
                        careered over the sky in the majesty of winter's storms, and then again
                        walking with his eyes cast down in deep meditation. The Spirit hovered over
                        him, and listened to the voice within his soul, and which cried louder the
                        more it was suppressed.</p>
                    <p>âMy heart is still young,â Leuthold murmured, âthough my years are gathering
                        fast behind me. What matters that? If Lucia loves me, why should I count my
                        years? But then her love is the love of a child; will it endure, when my
                        frame is shattered and my mind enfeebled, while she is still blooming and
                        fair? Shall I clasp her to me, then, with chilling fetters of duty, when the
                        romance of love has of necessity died<pb n="286" xml:id="VAB7020-289"></pb>
                        outâwhen I am old and she is youngâbound together like the living and the
                        dead? Would this be a meet return for her love? No, such love is not for me;
                        I will forget the dream.â</p>
                    <p>But while he endeavoured to grow firm, the Shadow saw that the struggle threw
                        the feebleness of added years over Leuthold's frame. Again he spoke, but
                        only in his heart; his lips were dumb.</p>
                    <p>âI am sinful; I think only of myself, and remember not him who struggles with
                        hopeless love. Shame! that I should dream of piercing another's breast with
                        the same arrow that almost drank the life-blood of my own! And yet, if Lucia
                        loves meâ. But I will think no more.â</p>
                    <p>And Leuthold with a troubled eye gazed over the dark lake, whose tossing
                        waves seemed restless as his own spirit. A little boat, in which he often
                        loved to glide over its surface, lay fastened to the willows at his feet,
                        heaving idly to and fro. An irresistible desire made him enter it, and he
                        was soon skimming over the wide lake alone. The ever-attendant Shadow beheld
                        his face as he sat watching the waves, which grew higher and whiter, until
                        the tiny vessel danced upon them like a feather. The clouds thickened, and
                        their gloom was reflected in Leuthold's countenance. Its expression was that
                        of passionless, hopeless desolation, mingled with a stern will, that seemed
                        to set the elements themselves at defiance. Darker and darker grew the
                        waves, the wintry night came down, and the lake boiled like a caldron. The
                        boat was drifted, Leuthold<pb n="287" xml:id="VAB7020-290"></pb> knew not
                        whither, but still he sat immoveable; he heard voices uttering his name, but
                        he thought they were only the spirits of the tempest calling him on to
                        death. At last a wave rose; it curled higher, higher; it broke, and the
                        little boat went down.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="*   *   *   *   *   *"></milestone>
                    <p>When Leuthold awoke to life he found himself in his own chamber, with kind
                        and well-known faces bending over him. One, dearest and kindest of all,
                        seemed to him like an angel from the world beyond the grave. He lifted his
                        heavy eyelids and closed them again, but not before a cry of joy had rung in
                        his ears: it was the voice of Lucia.</p>
                    <p>âHe lives! he lives! Leuthold! <emph>my</emph> Leuthold!â she murmured; and,
                        half-dreaming as he was, the master felt her warm tears falling one after
                        the other on his handâon his brow.</p>
                    <p>âLucia! <emph>my</emph> Lucia!â he was about to echo; when he heard a heavy
                        sigh, and saw in the face of George Surlan the most agonised despair. At
                        once the knowledge of all he had learned in his double existence came upon
                        the Self-seer, and with it rushed back memories of his own youth. The noble
                        heart which had suffered so much, refused to inflict on that of another a
                        like pang. The moment passed by, and the victory was wonâwon, before he
                        learned, as he did soon after, that he had been near the horrible death of
                        drowningâthat it was George Surlan who saved him.</p>
                    <p>During the long days and weeks of sickness that succeeded, that sweet, loving
                        face was continually<pb n="288" xml:id="VAB7020-291"></pb> hovering near him. He
                        knew that one word of his would awaken Lucia to the full consciousness of
                        feelings now scarce developed, would enrich him with the whole treasure of
                        her young love. Yet he never breathed that word. He pondered how he might
                        cause the dream of girlhood to remain a dream for ever, nor deepen into the
                        intensity of woman's love.</p>
                    <p>One day, as they sat alone together, Leuthold said to the maiden, who had
                        been lavishing on him various gentle offices, now continued more through
                        habit than necessity,â</p>
                    <p>âThou art a tender nurse, Lucia,âalmost like a grown woman, as thou wilt be
                        soon, dear child. And yet it seems but a day since I came hither, and the
                        little girl bade me welcome so shyly. How pleasant it has been for me to
                        find a home so full of love!â</p>
                    <p>âWas that love new to thee, good master?â answered the girl. âDid not every
                        one love thee as we?â</p>
                    <p>A deep sadness overspread Leuthold's face.</p>
                    <p>âDear child,â he said, âthere is in every heart some hidden sorrow. I have
                        never spoken of my youth, because there fell on it a dark shadow that will
                        never pass away.â</p>
                    <p>âThou hast told me of thy motherâof her death.â</p>
                    <p>âThere are griefs worse than death, Lucia.â</p>
                    <p>The girl's lips trembled, and she turned away her face as she said,â</p>
                    <p>âThere is a sorrow of which I have heard in old talesâof which George
                        singsâthe sorrow of love.â</p>
                    <p>âEven so,â returned Leuthold; and his voice sunk<pb n="289" xml:id="VAB7020-292"></pb> almost inaudibly, as if he were talking to
                        himself rather than to her. âI loved; for years this love was the dream of
                        my boyhood, the strength of my manhood, my hope, my joy, my very life,âand
                        it was in vain.â</p>
                    <p>âDid she die?â asked Lucia, in tones as low as his own.</p>
                    <p>âYes, to me; for she loved me not. Therefore has my life been lonely, and
                        will be to the end.â</p>
                    <p>âNot so!â tremblingly murmured Lucia. âA change may come. Thou mayst yet find
                        some true loving heart which will be precious in thy sight.â</p>
                    <p>âLucia,â answered the master, âthere are two kinds of love,âthe early dream
                        of fancy, which passes away like morning dew; and the deep, earnest passion,
                        strengthened year after year until it has become one with life itselfâwhich
                        can never change. As I have lived, so I shall die, true to that lost, yet
                        most precious love of old.â</p>
                    <p>Leuthold had nerved himself thus far; he had, with desperate calmness, laid
                        bare his heart, and the secret of his life had for the first time passed his
                        lips. He could say no more; he covered his face with his hands, and leaned
                        back exhausted. He did not seeâperhaps it was well he did notâthe changes in
                        Lucia's face. She grew deadly pale, and pressed her hand upon her heart, as
                        though there was a sharp pain there. In that moment her girlish air-palace
                        crumbled into dust, the bubble burst, the dream was gone! Womanly dignity,
                        not unmixed with shame, came to give her<pb n="290" xml:id="VAB7020-293"></pb>
                        strength; and when she again looked up, her whole mien was changed.</p>
                    <p>âI thank thee, dear master, for thus trusting me, though I am only a child.
                        The tale of thy sorrows shall never pass my lips.â</p>
                    <p>âBe it so, dear Lucia,â the master answered, in a faint tone. âOnly let it
                        rest in thy memory; and when, in thy coming years of womanhood, a true heart
                        lays at thy feet its whole wealth of love, cast it not from thee. Now, my
                        child, leave me, for I am weary and sad, and I would fain rest awhile.â</p>
                    <p>Lucia rose, and silently arranged the cushions of his chair, as she had done
                        since his sickness. She looked one moment with intense love on the pale,
                        sunken face that lay back with closed eyes on the pillow, and said, softly,â</p>
                    <p>âThe Virgin and all good saints comfort thee, my friend, my teacher, my more
                        than father!â</p>
                    <p>Leuthold felt her warm lips rest for a moment on his forehead, like the kiss
                        of a spirit in his dreams, and Lucia was gone.</p>
                    <p>It was, though she knew it not, the last farewell on earth between these
                        twain. At the dawn of morning Leuthold went forth, for the second time, a
                        wanderer over the wide world. Old Laurentius heard;âtalked of the
                        ingratitude of man, and trembled for his precious secret; Lucia wept over
                        the sorrow-worn spirit which could nowhere find rest; but George knew the
                        truth, and remembered, with almost adoring reverence, the self-denying man
                        who, in the midst of his own darkness, had made the path of others
                    bright.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">GOOD</hi> reader, if thou lovest tales of deep mystery and
                        exciting adventure, truly this is but a Barmecide's feast for thee! I have
                        led thee along through the straight path of human life without any turnings
                        or windings; thou hast had not a single maze of mystery to lose thyself in;
                        not one precipice of horrible doubt to whose brink thou goest smiling,
                        knowing well that thou wilt not be suffered to fall; I have not left thee to
                        grope thy way in darkness through terrible scenes of sorrow, which are to
                        end in a sudden burst of light; nor have I deluded thee with sunshine, until
                        thou camest to the mouth of a cavern of eternal gloom. To drop the metaphor,
                        this is a plain story of life; but more of the inner life of the heart, than
                        the visible existence of man. And such are the truest and the deepest of
                        all; for there is no romance of outward worldly fortunes like the history of
                        the heart.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, reader, if thou lovest such, if thou hast gone thus far with me,
                        and, perchance, on the way, some world-wide chords have been touched, which
                            have<pb n="292" xml:id="VAB7020-295"></pb> found an echo in thine own heart,
                        journey with me to the end.</p>
                    <p>Let us again pass unchronicled some years in Leuthold's life, and look upon
                        him once more. He was returning from long wandering abroad, to his native
                        Germany. Yes! the bent old man, with his thin gray hair and feeble steps,
                        slow and tremulous in spite of the staff he held, was, indeed, the same
                        Leuthold Auerbach, once the young student of Leipsic. He walked along like a
                        man who had no care to hasten his journey, inasmuch as it led to no home.
                        One always knows those happy travellers who have a place in view, towards
                        which their steps are tending; they look different from the wayside
                        loiterers, to whom all the world is the same.</p>
                    <p>As Leuthold journeyed, he stayed now and then to look at the bright summer
                        sky and pleasant country around him, or to listen to the birds. At such
                        times his eye lighted up with a spark of its olden fire. He had not lost all
                        the blessed feelings of youth, his heart had not grown old, for he still
                        loved and worshipped the beautiful in all things.</p>
                    <p>While he rested, the gay carol of a young man's voice reached his ear. It
                        came nearer and nearer, and at last the singer emerged from a winding in the
                        road. He seemed one of the race of wandering students so well known in
                        Germany. His cap was set on his head with a careless jauntiness; his small
                        bundle swung over his shoulder at the end of a stick; in his frank, handsome
                        face, might be read youth, health, a light heart,<pb n="293" xml:id="VAB7020-296"></pb> and a gay temper; and his joyous ditty gave full
                        confirmation of the same.</p>
                    <p>Leuthold watched him approach; and as the other perceived his
                        fellow-traveller he stopped his song, doffing his cap with the instinctive
                        respect of youth to age, which always betokens a good heart.</p>
                    <p>âThou art very merry, my young friend,â said Leuthold, smiling. âPray do not
                        cease that pleasant song. It does one good to hear it.â</p>
                    <p>âThanks, kind sir,â answered the young man. âI assure you it does me good to
                        sing it. It is quite a relief to be free to make a noise in this pleasant
                        open country, after being a long time shut up in musty rooms.â</p>
                    <p>âYou are a student, then?â</p>
                    <p>âOh, yes. I have been these two years at Heidelberg, and am now going home. I
                        never wished to studyâI hate such a dreary life; but my parents gave me the
                        name of a learned man, and thought, dear good creatures, that I must
                        perforce turn out learned, too. I fear they will be mistaken.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd what is your name, my merry young sir?â asked Leuthold, who took a vague
                        interest in the frank, pleasant face, as if he had seen it before; and felt
                        reluctant to lose sight of it.</p>
                    <p>â'Tis one that sounds wellâLeuthold Waldhof. But you seem to know it,â said
                        the young man, as his companion started from the fallen tree on which they
                        had both been sitting, and looked eagerly in his face.</p>
                    <p>âYes, I have heard it before.â</p>
                    <pb n="294" xml:id="VAB7020-297"></pb>
                    <p>âIndeed? Well, worthy sir, I was named after a learned man, whom my father
                        and mother knew when they were young. I have often heard my mother talk
                        about himâhow wise he was, and how good too. She made us love the name of
                        Leuthold Auerbach!â</p>
                    <p>âIs he living now?â asked the old man's tremulous voice.</p>
                    <p>âOh, no! surely not. He went away suddenly, a little before my father and
                        mother were married, and they never heard of him more. He had just gained
                        great honours for his learning; so grew tired of his dull native cityâat
                        least so my father used to sayâand they looked for a long time to hear of
                        his fame in some place or other. At last my mother said he must be dead, or
                        he would not have forgotten them, and I have often seen her weep when she
                        told us of him.â</p>
                    <p>Leuthold drew his cloak over his face, and his thin fingers played
                        convulsively with his stick. Alas, alas! that olden dream clung to him
                        still. He could not look upon the son of Herman and Hilda.</p>
                    <p>âI am wearying you, good sir, with this long story,â said the young student,
                        eyeing him with somewhat of curiosity; âand you seem to have journeyed far
                        to-day. Will you suffer me to bear you company awhile, and when you are
                        rested we can go on together. A young man's arm may help you over this rough
                        road.â</p>
                    <p>As the youth spoke, his mother's soul looked out of the kind brown eyesâhis
                        mother's tone breathed in the softened voice; at least so it seemed to
                        Leuthold. He<pb n="295" xml:id="VAB7020-298"></pb> gazed one moment in his face,
                        and then fell on the neck of Hilda's son.</p>
                    <p>âTell me of thy parentsâof Leipsicâof my ancient home,â cried the old man,
                        almost weeping. âTell me all, dear boy; for I am Leuthold Auerbach!â</p>
                    <p>Ere long the two who had so strangely met were sitting hand-in-hand, like old
                        friends, while the unconscious youth described to Leuthold the home of
                        Herman and Hildaâhow they lived surrounded by their children, with every
                        comfort that wealth could bestow, enjoying that household peace and unity
                        which makes home a very paradise of love. The boy spoke of his mother, and
                        the kindling of his eye told how dear Hilda was to her child.</p>
                    <p>âIs thy mother still as beautiful as she was?â murmured Leuthold.</p>
                    <p>âBeautiful!â answered the student, laughing. âWhy, none of us ever thought of
                        that: perhaps she might have been so once. My father says little Hilda is
                        very like her, and she is an angel of a child. But our mother is so good, so
                        tenderâwe love her so much.â</p>
                    <p>âYes, yes, all love her!â said the other, absently; his thoughts were
                        wandering to the old nook in the professor's house, and the young maiden who
                        sat there with her calm, sweet face, and her glossy hair.</p>
                    <p>âWhither art thou travelling, honoured friend?â asked the young man at last.
                        âSee! we have let the sun set upon our talkâhast thou far to go?â</p>
                    <p>âYes!âno!âI cannot tell,â muttered Leuthold<pb n="296" xml:id="VAB7020-299"></pb>
                        âI hardly know whither chance may lead me,â he added, with a faint smile; âI
                        have long been a wanderer.â</p>
                    <p>âThen thou shalt come home with me to my father's house; it will be so
                        pleasant. How proud I shall feel to have found thee, and brought thee again
                        to Leipsic!â</p>
                    <p>Leuthold half resisted the affectionate entreaty; even now his spirit shrank
                        from reviving that bitter sorrow of old. But when the earnest boy pictured
                        the welcome that awaited them, and especially how happy his mother would be,
                        the old man yielded, and they journeyed on together.</p>
                    <p>They parted for the nightâthe elder Leuthold and his young namesakeâmore like
                        father and son than like those who a few hours before had met as strangers.
                        But in the still hours, when youth slumbers in happy dreams and age alone is
                        wakeful, all the past came as vividly as yesterday to Leuthold's mind. It
                        came, yet brought no pain. He was as one who re-treads at eventide scenes
                        through which he has passed at morning. Now the dusky twilight is over all,
                        veiling alike the rich valley and the gloomy rocks; he knows they were there
                        once, but he sees them no longer, or only dim and indistinct. The whole
                        landscape of life, with its sunshine and storm, its joy and pain, seems all
                        peaceful now.</p>
                    <p>Leuthold thought, with a heart that throbbed no longer, of his early love. He
                        pictured her as he would soon see her, in her calm happiness, a mother and
                        wife; and he rejoiced that her gentle natureâwhich gave affectionate tears
                        to the imagined memory of the deadâ<pb n="297" xml:id="VAB7020-300"></pb> had
                        never been pained by the knowledge of the hopeless sorrow of the living. His
                        love for her had been unstained by one selfish feeling, and the balm of
                        sanctified affection lay upon his heart, giving it peace at last.</p>
                    <p>As he mused his eye fell upon a letter which he had carried for some days in
                        his bosom: it, too, brought blessed thoughts of trials passed, and duties
                        fulfilled.</p>
                    <p>âMy best friend, my dear master!â wrote George Surlan, ârejoice with me, for
                        my Lucia is won! How happy we are in our dear home at Ulmâshe loving me with
                        all wife-like love, none the less precious because it required long and
                        patient wooing, and was the growth of years. If thou couldst but see us
                        nowâsee Lucia, the dreamy fantastic girl, transformed into the sedatest
                        young matron in Ulmâsave that at times she leaves her busy household cares,
                        to laugh with her foolish husband, who has not grown wise yet, and has even
                        stolen away some of her own wisdom to make her like himself. Yet she thinks
                        him the greatest man that ever lived, always excepting thee, dear master.
                        Thou knowest how Laurentius has lately passed away: Geinsfleicht broke the
                        old man's heart. John and Peter are rich men now; but I do not envy them, I
                        have my Lucia and my noble Art. If thou comest to Ulm, thou shalt see our
                        cathedral rich in the work of my hands. Lucia says there could be no such
                        wood-carvings anywhere; perhaps it is because she sees her own sweet face,
                        and her husband's too, among the carved ornaments. What vanity in the little
                        lady!âDear master,<pb n="298" xml:id="VAB7020-301"></pb> forgive the foolishness
                        of a happy heart that will bless thee while it beats.â</p>
                    <p>Leuthold read for the twentieth time those joyful outpourings of content, and
                        then laid down and slept as peacefully as a child.</p>
                    <p>Reader, thou hast not been deluded by the creation of fancy. If thou goest to
                        Ulm, thou wilt see there, in the cathedral, wood-carvings so exquisite that
                        thou wilt marvel that nought but the artist's name, âGeorge Surlan,â has
                        descended to posterity. But among the saints, sybyls, and philosophers,
                        which he has carved, are two heads, life-like and yet most beautiful, which
                        tradition will tell thee are portraits of the artist and his wife. Lament
                        not thou if the lapse of time has swept away all other memorials. These two
                        silent images speak of youth and beautyâof divine Art and holy domestic
                        Love, mingled in sweet union, Surely, though fame has remembered them not,
                        happiest of the happy were George Surlan and his Lucia.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">AFTER</hi> some days' journey Leuthold and young Waldhof arrived
                        within sight of Leipsic. The boy gave full vent to the exuberance of his joy
                        until they drew near, and then the faintest possible shadow fell upon his
                        mirth. We all feel this, more or less, in coming homeâa sense as if we
                        hardly dare to be so happy. Young Leuthold did not marvel that his companion
                        was graver than ordinary, and a native delicacy of feeling contributed to
                        silence his tongue. Slowly and wearily the feet of the old man trod the road
                        down which he had fled like the wind on that early morning, impelled by the
                        agony of despairing love. The strength of youth was no more; but with it,
                        too, had passed away youth's keen sense of sorrow. Leuthold would not now
                        have recalled a single day of that olden time.</p>
                    <p>They stood before the garden where the last sound of Hilda's voice had rung
                        upon his ear. It was all<pb n="300" xml:id="VAB7020-303"></pb> changed; the
                        thick, shadowing trees were cut downâthe green alleys which Hilda had loved
                        so much,âand on the smooth lawn a troop of children were playing. The change
                        smote upon Leuthold's heart: he would not have found a single tree altered
                        in the dear old garden.</p>
                    <p>âThat was my grandfather's house,â said the young student. âDoubtless you
                        find it changed. After his death my father cut down the elms, and then sold
                        it.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd thy motherâwhat said she?â</p>
                    <p>âOh, she was quite satisfied that it was right, the trees made the house so
                        gloomy with their thick branches. I believe she was glad of the change.â</p>
                    <p>Hilda glad to see her ancient home despoiledâto see her lost father's
                        dwelling in the hands of strangers! It was a trifling thing, but Leuthold
                        was pained. For years, in his dreams, every turn in the long shady walks,
                        every bush and tree, had been visited by him in memoryânow even they were no
                        more.</p>
                    <p>As they passed down the narrow street, Leuthold glanced up at the window of
                        his own small room: the sanctuary of his spirit in those olden times. A
                        long, gaudy flag flaunted out of the lattice; they were celebrating a great
                        victory, and the town of Leipzic was bedizened like a conqueror's bride.
                        Leuthold turned away, and looked up no more until he found himself at the
                        abode of Herman.</p>
                    <p>âFather, father!â cried the joyful tones of the younger Waldhof, as they
                        heard a loud and somewhat coarse voice above the yelping of innumerable<pb n="301" xml:id="VAB7020-304"></pb> hounds at the entrance of the domain, and
                        saw a tall, heavily-made man lounging among various retainers.</p>
                    <p>âWhat! is't thou, my boy?â said the large man, laying his two hands on the
                        youth's shoulders. âGlad to see thee again! How much learning hast brought
                        from Heidelberg? As many ounces as thou hast grown inches? Thou wilt be a
                        wise fellow, Leuthold! Ha! ha! ha!â And a laugh loud and long spoke the
                        father's delight.</p>
                    <p>No way disconcerted, the student echoed his hoarse merriment in the silvery
                        tones of youth, and then said, proud of his mysterious secret,â</p>
                    <p>âGuess, father, whom I have found and brought to see you.â</p>
                    <p>Herr Waldhof glanced carelessly at the stranger. âSome master of thine, I
                        suppose. He is very welcome. Give me thy hand, old man; we'll use thee
                        well.â</p>
                    <p>But Leuthold held the broad, brown hand in his, and said,â</p>
                    <p>âHast thou forgotten me, Herman?â</p>
                    <p>There was no mistaking the low, sweet voice, which alone remained unchanged.
                        Herman almost buried the slight frame of his old friend in his giant
                        embrace, and shouted and laughed alternately, with joy at the recognition.
                        Then he held Leuthold out at arm's length, and scanned him closely.</p>
                    <p>âWhy, thou art grown an old man already! Never mind, we all change. How hast
                        thou lived, and<pb n="302" xml:id="VAB7020-305"></pb> where? But thou must come
                        and see Madame Waldhof.â</p>
                    <p>âMadame Waldhof!â How strange it sounded. Yet Leuthold was glad that the dear
                        name of Hilda was not uttered.</p>
                    <p>Herman and Leuthold passed through the long avenue together. Different as
                        they had been in youth, the contrast was more striking than ever in age.
                        Herman's full, broad face, spoke of the redundance of animal life. There was
                        little intelligence in the large eyes, and the handsome features had grown
                        almost coarse. Leuthold, with his attenuated frame, his thin and sharpened
                        face, was now more beautiful to look upon than Herman. The two men were
                        types of the sensual and the spiritual; one sinking the noblest form to its
                        own meanness, the other exalting the least beautiful exterior to the
                        nobility of the essence within.</p>
                    <p>As they reached the door, Leuthold drew back. âWilt thou not first tell thy
                        wife I am here? She may be startledâpained, at this sudden meeting with her
                        dead father's friend.â</p>
                    <p>Herr Waldhof laughed aloud. âOh, thou needst not fear; Hilda is not very much
                        given to sentiment. She grieves little over the old times now, I suspect.
                        Come along.â</p>
                    <p>In the old hallâit was the same in which we first beheld the two friendsâsat
                        a matron in the midst of a troop of noisy children and serving-maids. She
                        was rosy and contented-looking: not a wrinkle marked the comely brow; and
                        the brown eyes seemed ever smiling.<pb n="303" xml:id="VAB7020-306"></pb> The
                        round cheek and portly figure had long lost all the proportions of girlhood;
                        and something unmistakeable about the matron's air and tone, told of a
                        greater change than theseâa change in mind and soul. As Leuthold kissed the
                        hand of Madame Waldhof, he no longer thought of the Hilda of his boyhood.</p>
                    <p>She let fall a few tears as she spoke of her father, and then the wife of
                        Herman recovered her usual calm demeanour. She called her children, who,
                        after much resistance, came to kiss Leuthold's hand one by one. One,âa
                        sweet, modest-eyed, little maiden, whom her mother called Hilda,âcame and
                        stood by Leuthold's knee. It seemed as if the spirit of the first Hilda were
                        revived in her; as the old man met her open gaze, and laid his hand on her
                        soft braided hair, the child wondered that he repeated her name so often in
                        such a low, dreamy tone, and that as he kissed her, a tear, not her own, was
                        left upon her cheek. It had fallen to the memory of what was now
                        nothingnessâthe Hilda who once had been.</p>
                    <p>âYou will annoy Leuthold with all these young folk,â said Herman to his wife.
                        âMothers are so vain of their children! Come, old friend, and I will show
                        you all the changes I have made in the house.â</p>
                    <p>âYou have let this hall remain, I see,â said Leuthold, in a low tone, as they
                        went out. âDo you remember that night, Herman?â</p>
                    <p>âThe night I dreamed such a wild dream? It was some of thy strange fancies
                        which got into my brain, Leuthold; but I have forgotten all such things
                            now.<pb n="304" xml:id="VAB7020-307"></pb> Let us go and see the horses. I
                        hunt almost as much as ever, though I am not so young as I was the day I
                        quarrelled with Von Pâ. Ha! ha! Dost rememher it, Leuthold? To think how
                        foolish I made myself for the sake of that old dame yonder! Yet Hilda has
                        been a good wife to me; and we live very comfortably.â</p>
                    <p>âI am glad,â Leuthold answered, absently; and Herman continuedâ</p>
                    <p>âThose old times were pleasant, after all, and we often laugh over them. I
                        sometimes thought, after you went so suddenly, that you really fancied
                        Hilda. But if you did, I suppose you have long got over itâthese love
                        notions are foolish things. We are all wiser, and we need not quarrel about
                        her nowâHa! ha!â</p>
                    <p>And Waldhof's laugh made needless the answer which, for his life, Leuthold
                        could not have uttered. All that day he followed his friend mechanically,
                        sat at the board, listened to the husband and wife as they discussed the
                        daily household events, and chronicled the words and deeds of their
                        children. Once only the conversation turned on things in which Leuthold
                        could take an interest. He asked after the treasures of the professor's
                        library.</p>
                    <p>âOh, they have passed into different hands,â said Madame Waldhof. âI was told
                        that no one cares for manuscripts now, since printing has become known.â</p>
                    <p>âFor my part I care little for books or manuscripts either. One lives very
                        comfortably without being learned. I have not caught Madame Waldhof
                            reading<pb n="305" xml:id="VAB7020-308"></pb> this long time; and I think of
                        her just as highly. I imagine she, too, is quite as contented with me as if
                        I were the cleverest man living.â</p>
                    <p>Hilda looked up in her husband's face with a beaming smile, and laid her hand
                        in his. That look brought back her girlish daysâit showed that one feeling
                        remained the sameâwoman's love!</p>
                    <p>At last, when Herr Waldhof had fallen asleep, and his wife sat spinning
                        beside him in perfect silence, lest his slumbers should be broken, Leuthold
                        crept away to his own chamber. There, in the stillness of meditation, his
                        whole life rose up before him with its array of shadows. They glided past
                        him, fast changing like forms in a dream. He alone remained the same. To the
                        time of gray hairs Leuthold had carried the one true feeling of lifeâlove.
                        It was a reality; all the rest were but fleeting shadows. He rejoiced that
                        it had been so; that his love had been made immortal in memory; that,
                        embalmed by suffering, the one ideal had remained secure through the changes
                        of life. In this love he rested; still worshipping, not the real Hilda, the
                        wife of Herman, but the Hilda of his dreamsâthe pure image of womanhood. He
                        lovedânot her, but love itself.</p>
                    <p>Again in his solitude his guardian angel stood beside Leuthold. It showed him
                        the difference between the life of the body and the life of the soul; it
                        painted the man-animal at his feasts, at his pleasures, wasting his
                        existence in petty joys; how, when the mask of youth falls off, he sinks
                        down, down, by lower degrees, until,<pb n="306" xml:id="VAB7020-309"></pb> in
                        the aged driveller, no sign remains of the casket that contained a divine
                        soul.</p>
                    <p>âWouldst thou have exchanged thy life, with all its lonelinessâall its
                        caresâfor such an one as this?â murmured the inner voice. âHast thou not
                        been rich?âin the wealth of thy soul. Hast thou not been happy?âin
                        scattering blessings on others, far and wide. Hast thou not been loved? for
                        all holy spirits look down with immortal tenderness on the man who walks the
                        earth in purity, in meekness, and in charity. Thou hast done thy work, O
                        faithful one! Lay thy burden down, and enter into thy rest.â</p>
                    <p>And on Leuthold's ear fell another low toneâsolemn and sweetâwhich he knew
                        well.</p>
                    <p>âCome,â it breathed, âson of my love, I wait for thee! Come home! The shadows
                        are passing away: the immortal day is dawning. Thou hast lived, thou hast
                        suffered, thou hast conquered. Now rejoice!â</p>
                    <p>As the old man listened, a heavenly smile brightened his face, for he knew
                        that the time of his departure was at hand. He looked out into the night,
                        and the angels of the stars breathed their influence down upon him. Every
                        ray, as it fell, brought with it a divine message, penetrating to his inmost
                        soul. Joyfully, rapturously that weary soul answered the summons, and spread
                        its wings to the land of immortality.</p>

                <head>THE SCULPTOR OF BRUGES.</head>
                <p><hi rend="b">ABOUT</hi> the middle of the sixteenth century, there was not an
                    artist in the Netherlands whose fame had spread wider than that of Messer
                    Andrea, the sculptor of Bruges. His father had come from Italy, and settled in
                    Flanders, where he lived and struggled, an ardent and enthusiastic man, whose
                    genius cast just sufficient light to show him his own defects. This love of the
                    beautiful was the sole inheritance he left his son. But Andrea's northern birth
                    and education had, to a certain degree, qualified his Italian descent, so that
                    to his father's impulsive nature he added a steady perseverance, without which
                    all the genius in the world is but as a meteor of a moment.</p>
                <p>The branch of design that Andrea followed was wood-carving, in which, by his
                    wonderful skill, he surpassed all his contemporaries. In our day, it is
                    impossible, from the few relics that remain, to know the perfection to which our
                    ancestors of the middle ages carried this art; which attained even to the
                    dignity of sculpture, when Gothic saints and Madonnas looked down from their
                    niches in cathedrals: though the<pb n="308" xml:id="VAB7020-311"></pb> names of the
                    unknown artists who carved these lovely heads and graceful draperies were
                    forgotten, even before the frail material in which they worked had lost its
                    first freshness.</p>
                <p>The sculptor of Bruges was one of these now-forgotten artists; and yet an artist
                    he was, in the highest sense of the word. He lived and moved among beautiful
                    forms; they influenced his character and refined his mind, yet did not make him
                    unfit for association with the world. Riches and honour came with his fame,
                    until he stood high in the regard of his fellow-citizens; and the son of the
                    poor Italian student was at last deemed worthy to wed one who had long been the
                    object of an almost hopeless love, a daughter of one of the highest families in
                    Bruges. This union could not but be a happy one; and Andrea and his wife slowly
                    advanced towards middle age, feeling that their present bliss had not belied the
                    promise of their youth. Still, there were a few bitter drops in their cup: the
                    husband and wife saw several of their children drop off one by one, until all
                    that remained were two boys and a daughterâthe lovely little Gertrude, who was
                    her father's darling. Nevertheless, these three were sufficient to make the
                    sculptor's home cheerful, and the lost brothers and sisters were hardly missed.</p>
                <p>At the time when our story begins, Andrea had finished his latest work;âa group
                    of angels, carved in wood, to adorn the church of Bruges. The burghers crowded
                    to gaze upon and admire the work of their fellow citizen, of whom they were so
                    justly proud.<pb n="309" xml:id="VAB7020-312"></pb> It was indeed a fine specimen of
                    the ancient Gothic carving, such as one meets with sometimes even now in old
                    churches, where the hand of innovation has not reached. Three angels formed the
                    group, one kneeling with up-raised eyes and folded hands, while the other's
                    extended arms were lifted upwards in rapturous adoration; and the third, looking
                    down on the worshippers below, pointed towards heaven. It won universal praise.
                    The artist stood apart, in pleasure not unmingled with honest pride, when many a
                    hand shook his own in friendly congratulation, and many an eye, made humbler by
                    rank and distance, looked at him admiringly.</p>
                <p>In all the pleased assembly there was but one dissentient voice, and that was
                    from a brother artist and rival of Andrea. Melchior Kunst was one of those dark
                    and unquiet spirits who seem to cast a shadow wherever they go. He was a man of
                    great talent, yet no one loved him. They could hardly tell whyâyet so it was.
                    Even now, all instinctively made way for him, and Melchior strode on until he
                    stood opposite the group. He folded his arms, and looked at it fixedly from
                    under his dark brows. Then he addressed the artist, who stood at a little
                    distance.</p>
                <p>âDoubtless you think this very fine, Messer Andrea?â</p>
                <p>âIt is not what <emph>I</emph> think of it, but the judgment which the world puts
                    on my work, that is of consequence,â answered Andrea calmly.</p>
                <p>âThe composition is well imitated, certainly.â</p>
                <pb n="310" xml:id="VAB7020-313"></pb>
                <p>âImitated? it is my own.â</p>
                <p>âIndeed!â said Melchior, with a quiet sneer sitting on his lipsâthe handsomest
                    feature of his very handsome face. âIndeed! And so you never go into another's
                    studio, and copy figures, attitude, and design, as you have here copied from
                    me?â</p>
                <p>âIt is not true,â said Andrea, with difficulty restraining his passion.</p>
                <p>âI tell you it is,â cried his opponent. âLook, gentlemen! brother artists, look!
                    this group is mineâmy own design; and here I execute my will upon what is my
                    own!â He drew a hatchet from under his cloak, and before the wonder-stricken
                    spectators could interfere, he severed one of the upraised hands of the nearest
                    figure.</p>
                <p>Andrea was stung to the quick by this mutilation of his work; all his Italian
                    blood was roused within him: he rushed upon Kunst with the fury of a tiger at
                    bay. Those around interfered, but it was needless; for Andrea's well-constituted
                    mind had already got the better of his momentary rage, and he stood, pale, but
                    self-possessed, gazing alternately at his adversary and at his own despoiled
                    work.</p>
                <p>âMelchior Kunst,â said he at last, âyou think you have done me a great injury;
                    and so you have, but not an irreparable one. I will not revenge myself now, but
                    you will be repaid some time.â</p>
                <p>A loud laugh from Kunst made the sculptor once more clench his hands, while the
                    bright red mounted to his brow; but he said no more, and after Melchior's<pb n="311" xml:id="VAB7020-314"></pb> departure he too left the hall with some
                    friends, who were stricken dumb by this untoward quarrel.</p>
                <p>It was late in the evening when Andrea returned towards his own home. He walked
                    slowly along by the side of the dark and gloomy canal, which the setting light
                    of the young moon only made more solemn and fearful. Thick ivy-hung walls, even
                    in the daytime, cast a heavy shadow on the water; and now it looked like some
                    dark abyss, which no man could fathom. Here and there some pale solitary ray of
                    moonlight pierced through the branches of the acacias that overhung the opposite
                    side, seeming like a bright arrow flashing through the darkness.</p>
                <p>Andrea's heart was very heavy. His triumph had ended in pain: disappointment not
                    only at the injury done to his work, but at the unjust accusation of Melchior
                    Kunst. Andrea knew how ready are the suspicions of the world when once aroused;
                    and he fancied that already cold and doubtful eyes examined his group with less
                    favour than heretofore. And besides, the sudden ebullition of anger to which he
                    had been goaded left an exhaustion, both bodily and mental; as is usually the
                    case with men of Andrea's gentle and not easily-roused temperament.</p>
                <p>The sculptor walked on quickly amidst the gathering darkness, for the moon had
                    now set. He fancied now and then that he heard stealthy footsteps at a distance
                    behind him; and perhaps this made him unconsciously urge his pace. Andrea was no
                    coward, but it was a lonely place by the water-side, and he was <choice>
                        <orig>un-</orig>
                        <reg>unarmed</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="312" xml:id="VAB7020-315"></pb> armed. Still, as the footsteps
                    approached no nearer, he reproached himself for yielding to the delusion of an
                    imagination heated by the events of the day. All at once he heard distinctly a
                    plunge in the water of some heavy body. His first idea was, that some
                    unfortunate had thus ended his life and his miseries; but the sound was so
                    distant, that he was uncertain. He retraced his steps; but there was nothing to
                    justify his previous thought. The canal flowed on, silent and dark as before:
                    not a struggle, not a groan, not a cry rose up from its gloomy depths. It could
                    have been only a heavy stone, which had fallen from the old dilapidated wall
                    into the waters beneath. Andrea felt sure of this, and went on his way until he
                    reached his homeâa home where, since he left, danger and anxiety had entered.</p>
                <p>Three days after this, two armed officers of justice made their appearance in the
                    dwelling of the sculptor of Bruges. They came to take prisoner the master of the
                    house, accused of the crime of murder! From the day of the contest in the hall,
                    Melchior Kunst had never been seen, until that morning, when his lifeless body
                    had floated up from the bed of the canal into the very market-place. Then one of
                    the horror-stricken bystanders remembered that on the same night of their
                    quarrel Messer Andrea had been seen to pass by the way that led along the canal,
                    and that not long after Melchior Kunst also followed. Another man, who lived
                    near, had heard a plunge in the water, but thought it was only his own dog, who
                    often at night<pb n="313" xml:id="VAB7020-316"></pb> swam across the canal. A third
                    also had met lesser Andrea beside the canal, but had seen no other person. This
                    was sufficient evidence to convict the unfortunate artist.</p>
                <p>The officers found their prisoner alone. He was sitting with his head buried in
                    his hands, and hardly moved at their entrance. One of them laid his hand on the
                    sculptor's shoulder, and claimed him as a prisoner.</p>
                <p>Andrea looked up with a face so listless, so vacant, so deadly pale, that the
                    officer started, and unconsciously let go his hold.</p>
                <p>âA prisoner!â said Andrea, without making an effort to move. âWhat have I done?
                    Who accuses me?â</p>
                <p>The officer was a man of kindly nature, who had known Messer Andrea in former
                    times. He gently and respectfully explained his errand; but had to repeat it
                    several times before Andrea comprehended them. It seemed that some heavy cloud
                    darkened his faculties. At last he understood the whole.</p>
                <p>âSo they accuse me of being a murdererâan assassin?â said he, rising, while a
                    shiver ran through his frame. Then, addressing the first officer, âYou were a
                    good man onceâfollow me!â The other hesitated. âYou need not fear,â continued
                    Andrea; âI am unarmedâI have no thought of escaping from justice.â</p>
                <p>The man followed his prisoner until they came to a darkened room: it was the
                    chamber of death. On the bed lay the pale and shrouded form of a woman. Very
                    beautiful she must have been, and her beauty had<pb n="314" xml:id="VAB7020-317"></pb> scarcely passed its maturity. No long illness had taken away the roundness of
                    health from her face, so that even in death she looked lovely as a marble
                    statue. The long, dark lashes rested on her cheek, and a few locks of jet black
                    hair, escaping from the fillet that bound her head, gave a life-like air to her
                    repose. By her side lay an infantâa flower of an hourâwhose little soul had come
                    into it at sunrise, and departed at sunset. They were the wife and child of
                    Andrea.</p>
                <p>The sculptor pointed to the dead. âLook there,â he said, âand say if I am likely
                    to have revenged any trifling insultâif I am likely to have been a murderer!â
                    His voice grew hoarse; he stretched his arms towards the body of his wife, and
                    then fell to the earth in strong convulsions.</p>
                <p>During nearly the whole time that elapsed between his apprehension and trial,
                    Andrea was dead to the consciousness of his misery. A low fever enfeebled all
                    his senses, and reduced his outward form to the appearance of an old man. His
                    friendsâfor he had still manyâtook both his sons to their charge. It was well
                    that they did, for the father seemed to have lost all remembrance even of their
                    existence. When they visited him, he took not the least notice of them; so the
                    children were at last wisely sent far away from the scene of disgrace and
                    suffering. But with Gertrude the father would not part. She was a fair little
                    creature, the image of her mother in feature and expression, but her complexion
                    resembled her father. Her eyes were of that deep brown-gray which is seldom<pb n="315" xml:id="VAB7020-318"></pb> seen beyond childhoodâso dark, that a
                    careless observer would call them black. Gertrude's hair was of that colour
                    which the old masters often gave to heads of Christ and of the Virginâwhich the
                    uninitiated might call red, but which painters know to be the most beautiful of
                    all tints. It gave to sweet Gertrude the appearance of an angel.</p>
                <p>The first evidence that Andrea showed of returning consciousness, was in
                    recognising his little daughter, and calling her by her name. It was her
                    mother's also; and perhaps that, aided by the strong resemblance, was a comfort
                    to the widowed father. He began to talk coherently, first with Gertrude and then
                    with others who came to see him; and by degrees his mind and body gathered
                    strength, so that he was able to think of his defence against the terrible crime
                    laid to his charge. This was a momentous thing, for the proofs were all against
                    him, and Andrea could bring no evidence in his own favour, save his own
                    explanation of what had happened on his way homewards on that fatal day, and the
                    irreproachable character he had borne all his life.</p>
                <p>At last the sculptor of Bruges was brought from prison to the judgment-hall. He
                    seemed to himself like one risen from the grave, and so he likewise appeared to
                    those about him. Andrea had been a strong, powerful, noble-looking man, but now
                    all his flesh had shrunk away, and his height only made him appear more shadowy.
                    Dark circles were round his eyes, and his face bore an unvaried sallow hue.<pb n="316" xml:id="VAB7020-319"></pb> Nevertheless, his mien was firm and composed;
                    no one could look at him, and for a moment doubt his innocence. Andrea's little
                    daughter stood by his side; one might have likened her to a flower growing close
                    beside a tomb. Gertrude had become accustomed to the change in her father's
                    looks, and the shocked and anxious gaze of all around struck her with alarm. She
                    crept closer to him, never taking her eyes from his face.</p>
                <p>The trial proceeded. All was against Andrea: even the words he had uttered before
                    Melchior left the hall, were brought in judgment against him: they had sounded
                    like a threat. None who had known Andrea doubted in their own hearts that he was
                    a guiltless man, but the circumstantial evidence was too strong to be legally
                    contradicted. The accused was found guilty; and Andreaâthe gentle, upright man,
                    who had never lifted a hand against a fellow-creature, save in that one evil
                    hour when he was driven to passion by Melchior Kunstâwas removed from the hall
                    of justice with the stain of murder on his name.</p>
                <p>The execution of the sentence was deferred for a short space, for the sake of the
                    hitherto unsullied character of the criminal. In those days the hand of law was
                    often tampered with, and never was it with greater show of justice than in this
                    instance. Andrea's many friends interposed on his behalf. They succeeded in
                    obtaining only a suspension of the sentence for a few months, that some chance
                    might elicit the truth which so many doubted. But in the interim the sculptor<pb n="317" xml:id="VAB7020-320"></pb> was ordered to execute some work of art to
                    adorn the Palais de Justice at Bruges, where he had been tried. For this purpose
                    he was brought from his cell, and confined in the hall which had witnessed his
                    trial.</p>
                <p>It was a large, gloomy-looking chamber, so dimly lighted from without, that even
                    at mid-day the dark shadows in the corners of the room looked like night. An
                    immense hearth, on which lay a few faggots, was the only cheerful object, but
                    even that light and warmth did not reach beyond the immediate vicinity of the
                    fire. There was no furniture in the room, save one small table in the centre, a
                    bench, and a straw couch in the gloomiest corner. It was a place in which one
                    would instinctively shrink from looking behind, and where one's own footsteps
                    would sound hollow and full of dread, as if something fearful were following
                    after. Andrea and his daughter heard the heavy door close, and they were alone
                    in the hall. The little girl led her father to the bench beside the hearth, and
                    then sat down at his feet, holding his hands fast in hers. She dared not look
                    anywhere but at the bright fire and at her father's face; even the shadows that
                    the flames cast on the ceiling made her start sometimes. Gertrude had been
                    accustomed to a prison, for she had never left her father, except when taken
                    home at night, to return next morningâbut this place seemed gloomier still than
                    the dungeon.</p>
                <p>Andrea had no hope. His life had been free from any very heavy sorrows, and the
                    first that came, so fearful as they were, quite overwhelmed him. His sole
                        desire<pb n="318" xml:id="VAB7020-321"></pb> now was to employ the short remnant
                    of his life in executing some memorial of his talents to leave behind him, that
                    when time had removed the shadow from his fame, his children might have no
                    reason to blush for their father. He returned again to his long-cherished
                    occupation. For a while this gave him sensations almost amounting to pleasure.
                    His step became lighter, and his countenance lost somewhat of its settled
                    melancholy. He almost forgot his sorrows, his blighted name, his impending doom,
                    in the exercise of his beloved art. He would cease from his work, look at the
                    beautiful figure which had risen to life under his hand, and murmur to himself,
                    âWhat man will say that the hand of an assassin has done this?âthat the brain
                    which conceived this dream of beauty could plan a murder?â</p>
                <p>And by degrees the influence of his art in some measure soothed the mind of the
                    sorrow-stricken man. His desolate prison became cheerful with the graceful forms
                    which it contained, and Gertrude moved among the whole like a beautiful spirit.
                    If ever the sculptor clung to hope and life, it was when he looked at his
                    darling child, and at the more imperishable offspring of his genius.</p>
                <p>At last Andrea's work drew nigh to a close: the wood-sculpture was finished. Then
                    it was that the enthusiasm which had sustained him faded away, and the artist's
                    soul sank within him. He gave the last touches to his beautiful workâhe knew he
                    could do no moreâand then went and sat down in a stupor of grief<pb n="319" xml:id="VAB7020-322"></pb> and despair. Gertrude clung round him, but he did not
                    speak to her or embrace her.</p>
                <p>âFather, dear father, are you weary? You are not angry with your little girl?â
                    and the child stood on tiptoe, trying to remove the hands which covered his
                    face.</p>
                <p>Andrea seemed hardly conscious of her presence. He did not move, but kept
                    repeating every now and then in a low tone, âI have done my workâI have no
                    hopeânow let me die.â</p>
                <p>The terrified child, who had all along been kept in ignorance of her father's
                    doom, began to weep, but her tears were unregarded. An hour after the
                    magistrates of Bruges entered. They came to view the finished work of the
                    artist. High as Andrea's reputation had been, they did not expect so beautiful a
                    group as that which now met their eyes. Its subject was âeternal justiceâânot
                    the woman with bound eyes and balanced scalesâbut an open-eyed angel,
                    all-beholding, and equally requiting all. They looked upon it in silence, and
                    then turned to the artist, who, wan and haggard, stood behind his judges. One of
                    them, an old man, was melted even to tears. Forgetting the dignity of office,
                    the magistrate took hold of the criminal's hand and led him to a seat.</p>
                <p>âYou must not stand, Messer Andrea; you are not yet strong,â said he
                    compassionately. âSit and rest, while we examine your beautiful work.â</p>
                <p>The sculptor obeyed without a word: he was passive as a child. Little Gertrude,
                    who had shrunk away at<pb n="320" xml:id="VAB7020-323"></pb> the sight of strangers,
                    came and stood silently behind her father, taking fast hold of his garments. The
                    two magistrates inspected the sculpture, and could not restrain their
                    admiration. The eye of the unfortunate artist brightened for a moment at their
                    warm praise, but immediately his face returned to its accustomed melancholy.</p>
                <p>âIt is all in vain,â he answered; âyou cannot make men forget the pastâyou cannot
                    remove the blot from the name of my childrenâyou cannot give to their father his
                    forfeit life.â</p>
                <p>The magistrates looked at one another, and the elder one spoke.</p>
                <p>âThere is hope still, Messer Andrea; have you courage to hear it?â</p>
                <p>The artist started up. âTell me only that I am proved innocent, and I will thank
                    God and die.â</p>
                <p>âWe do not promise quite so much,â said one of the judges, wishing to temper
                    Andrea's violent excitement.</p>
                <p>âYet take heart! Many strange things have been discovered to-day,â continued the
                    aged man whose kindness had first moved Andrea. âBe calm now; ere long we may
                    send you good news: nay,â and the good man could no longer hide his hopeful
                    tidings, âit is not impossible that you may be free to-morrow.â</p>
                <p>The magistrates departed, leaving the poor prisoner with a wildly-throbbing
                    heart, which he vainly endeavoured to still. All that day he sat with Gertrude
                    in his arms, kissing her, fondling her, at times almost weeping over her. To all
                    the questions of the <choice>

                    âTo-morrow, love: we may be free to-morrow.â</p>
                <p>And when the attendants came to remove Gertrude for the night, he unclasped her
                    arms from round his neck, with the promise that he too would go away with her
                    to-morrow.</p>
                <p>âGo away to-morrow?â cried the happy child. âWill you, too, leave this gloomy
                    place to-morrow, and return no more?â</p>
                <p>âGod forbid I should return! No, my child, never more,â answered the father, with
                    a shudder.</p>
                <p>âAnd shall we go out togetherâshall we go to our own home?â pursued Gertrude.</p>
                <p>âYes, dear child,â said Andrea, as he kissed her once more, and set her on the
                    ground from his arms, that were too weak for even so light <choice>
                        <sic>aburden</sic>
                        <corr>a burden</corr>
                    </choice>. âYes, my Gertrude, I shall indeed go home to-morrow.â</p>
                <p>He had spoken truth.</p>
                <p>Soon after daybreak next morning some officers entered the hall, bearing a
                    release for the prisoner. A strangerâan Italian womanâwho had once passed
                    through Bruges, and lately returned thither, deposed to having received a letter
                    from Melchior Kunst, dated on the fatal day, stating his determined intention of
                    self-murder at the time and place where he was discovered to have met his end.</p>
                <p>Further than this was never known. Andrea was innocent! His fellow-citizens
                    rejoiced as one manâfor Messer Andrea was proved innocent.</p>
                <p>They found him in the prison, leaning on the table,<pb n="322" xml:id="VAB7020-325"></pb> his head resting on his arms, and his upturned face
                    raised towards his beautiful work. But as they drew nearer, they saw that his
                    countenance was meaningless, and that no life shone in his fixed and open eyes.
                    The sculptor of Bruges was dead-his heart had broken with joy.<ref target="#craik-1avillionnote01">*<ref></ref></ref></p>

                <head rend="font(gothic)" type="sub">A True Story of the English Poor.</head>
                <p><hi rend="b">IN</hi> one of the midland counties of England there is a district,
                    the name of which we shall not give, but merely allude to its characteristics.
                    It has risen up within the last century, until, from a few clusters of poor
                    cottages, the seat of a manufacture of trifling importance, it has become one of
                    the wealthiest, most populous, and most intelligent communities within the three
                    kingdoms. The five or six small hamlets have grown into towns, whose boundaries
                    meeting, have all merged into one mass of habitations; so that, but for the
                    diversity of name which each portion still preserves, it might be considered as
                    one large city of manufactures, such as Manchester or Birmingham. But like most
                    newly-risen places, this region still presents an anomalous mixture of town and
                    country; for instance, between two colonies where the manufacture is carried on,
                    a few green meadows yet unbuilt upon, will intervene; and the tall chimney of<pb n="324" xml:id="VAB7020-327"></pb> âthe worksâ sometimes casts its smoke upon a
                    puny corn-field or a blackberry hedge. Alternately the eye views green wooded
                    undulations and hills covered with red brick houses, as if town and country were
                    struggling together for the mastery. But as soon as the habitations are left
                    behind, the ruralities of the place triumph, and the naturally beautiful face of
                    the country is seen in all its luxuriousness.</p>
                <p>On a little hill up which the road winds, just without the town, wasâperhaps isâa
                    row of cottages inhabited by working people. But with one only have we to do.
                    Its inmates sat or lolled outside the door, enjoying the cool summer evening.
                    They were a mother and some half-dozen children, of all sizes and ages. Mrs.
                    Sutton was a comfortable-looking, middle-aged woman, clad with tolerable
                    neatness. Whether she had ever been pretty, was a matter entirely traditional:
                    probably she had, for the neighbourhood to which she belonged is remarkable for
                    the good looks of its damsels; but the wear and tear of eight-and-thirty years
                    had entirely obliterated Mrs. Sutton's beauty, if she ever had any. She stood
                    tossing her youngest hope, a baby of three months old, and watching the two
                    others playing at marbles. They were sturdy boys, save that their faces had the
                    paleness which was the result of their occupation; a circumstance which never
                    fails to strike a visitant to this region, where the workpeople all acquire the
                    same pallid hue. Yet it is not unhealthy; and it gives the young girls a
                    delicate complexion, which, though fleeting, is still very <choice>
                        <orig>attrac-</orig>
                        <reg>attractive</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="325" xml:id="VAB7020-328"></pb> tive while it lasts. Mrs. Sutton's
                    little maidens were an evidence of this fact: two fairer blossoms never grew up
                    in a poor man's home than did the twins, Edna and Keziah.</p>
                <p>And hereâto account for such extraordinary appellationsâwe must premise that
                    Scripture names of the most out-ofthe-way character are at a premium in the
                    neighbourhood of which we writeâthe boys being all Enochs, Calebs, or Obadiahs;
                    the girls all Miriams, Jemimas, or Naomis, with a sprinkling of such
                    ultra-romantic cognomens as Thyrza, Zillah, or Rosanna. One cannot but observe
                    how these things mark the character of the early inhabitants of a region which
                    was once the stronghold of Wesley and Whitfield; how, whether or no the
                    descendants of these saintly-named children have kept up their progenitors'
                    Christian zeal, they have certainly kept up their Christian names.</p>
                <p>But we are wandering from Mrs. Sutton. She, good soul, was wandering too, at
                    least her eyes were, for she was watching up the hill a couple who seemed both
                    weary and waysore;âa young woman, and a man who might have been any age from
                    twenty to forty, for he had the hard sallow features which never show the
                    progress of time. Still less would years be marked on his low and ungainly
                    figure, which was stunted and slightly deformedâa strong contrast to the tall
                    and upright form of his companion. This ill-matched pair came near Mrs. Sutton's
                    door, and then the man, after whispering to his fellow-traveller, <choice>
                        <orig>ad-</orig>
                        <reg>addressed</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="326" xml:id="VAB7020-329"></pb> dressed the good dame in broken
                    English, which she could not understand. She looked inquiringly at the woman.</p>
                <p>âMy husbandââMrs. Sutton could not help a slight start, and glance of surprise at
                    the man, as the young creature said thisââmy husband means that we are very
                    tired, and would be glad of a lodging for the night, if you can give us one, or
                    direct us elsewhere. We can pay you,â she added, with a half smile, seeing the
                    doubtful expression of Mrs. Sutton's face. But to do the latter justice, we must
                    say that it was caused as much by her surprise at hearing the young wife speak
                    in the good vernacular tongue, mingled with a natural feminine curiosity to know
                    the reason that any Englishwoman could marry such a man.</p>
                <p>Perhaps this latter quality, added to her good-nature, made her assent to their
                    request.</p>
                <p>âYou can sit down and rest,â she said, âand I'll get you some supper; but I can't
                    promise more till my âmasterâ comes homeââ<emph>master</emph> being the Sâshire
                    equivalent for husband; and, alas! sometimes the title is only too true. But in
                    this case it was a mere form of speech, as every one knew that Mrs. Sutton was
                    both master and mistress herself in her own house.</p>
                <p>So the two wanderers sat down, and soon the cottage-hearth was blazing with a
                    friendly brightness which is at the will of the poorest labourer in this
                    plentiful land of coal. Oh, there are no such fires out of Sâshire! The
                    foreigner bent over his supper in hungry taciturnity, occasionally darting
                    glances from<pb n="327" xml:id="VAB7020-330"></pb> his large, bright, black eyes,
                    that seemed the more piercing from the bushy eyebrows under which they gleamed,
                    and, in conjunction with the long, matted hair and the yellow skin, made Mrs.
                    Sutton feel rather uncomfortable. She hated foreigners; but her motherly and
                    womanly sympathy was excited by the weary and sickly look of the young wife, who
                    had all an Englishwoman's claims to compassion; and Mrs. Sutton inly resolved
                    that, whatever her âmasterâ said, these strange wayfarers should remain for a
                    night's shelter under her roof.</p>
                <p>They did remain, and before noon on the following day, Pietro Pontiâthat was his
                    name, he saidâhad so ingratiated himself with the children, as to win a few
                    kindly opinions from the mother herself; while his gentle wife was liked so
                    much, that Mrs. Sutton almost felt it a relief when, after paying for their
                    lodging, they requested to occupy it for another day or so.</p>
                <p>âShe is such a mild, soft-spoken young creature,â was Mrs. Sutton's confidential
                    observation to her husband John, after the first day passed with their
                    inmatesââshe seems almost a lady. I wonder what on earth could have made her
                    marry that ugly little fellow!â</p>
                <p>And probably the good dame's curiosity would have led her on to direct
                    questionings instead of vague wonderment, had she not been withheld by a certain
                    reserve and refinement which marked the young woman's deportment, and caused the
                    mechanic's wife to treat her with unconscious deference. Yet she was not
                        proud,<pb n="328" xml:id="VAB7020-331"></pb> for she always helped Mrs. Sutton
                    in her domestic duties without any reluctance or awkwardness.</p>
                <p>At last Pietro spoke of proceeding onwards; and then the anxious looks of his
                    wife loosened Mrs. Sutton's tongue. She boldly asked whither they intended
                    going.</p>
                <p>âIâI hardly know,â said the wife, timidly. Ponti, in his broken English,
                    explained that he was an Italian, who gained his living by catching bullfinches
                    and larks, and teaching them to sing, in the hope of meeting purchasers.</p>
                <p>âA pretty way of making a fortune!â thought Mrs. Sutton; and then she said,
                    âWell, master, if such is your trade, you may as well follow it here as
                    anywhere: you will find plenty of birds in the fields hereabouts; and as your
                    wife seems comfortable, why, suppose you were to stay with us a little longer?â</p>
                <p>This proposal caused a consultation between the husband and wife, if a
                    consultation it could be called, where Pietro had all the talk to himself, and
                    his helpmate meekly acquiesced. It ended in an assent to the offer, and the
                    Italian and his wife were fairly established in the Sutton family.</p>
                <p>âI am really glad you are not going, Mrs. Ponti,â was the hearty exclamation of
                    the kindly hostess to her young friend the first time they happened to be alone.
                    âI wonder your husband could think of dragging you up and down the country.â</p>
                <p>âHe never thought about it, I believe,â was the deprecating reply. âBut,â added
                    the wife, while her<pb n="329" xml:id="VAB7020-332"></pb> cheek flushed and her head
                    drooped, âI am glad to stay hereâfor the present. I would not like going among
                    strangers now.â</p>
                <p>âAh, no, no, poor girl!â quickly answered Mrs. Sutton: âbut have you no mother to
                    be with you?â She repented of her words ere they were well uttered; for the girl
                    burst into a fit of weeping so violent, that all the consolatory endearments
                    that women of all classes instinctively use to one another in time of affliction
                    were employed by Mrs. Sutton in vain. At last the wife of the Italian grew
                    calmer, and said without tears, though in accent of the deepest sorrow, âI have
                    no relatives, no friends in the wide world, except my husband.â</p>
                <p>âPoor thingâpoor thing! But you know, my dear, a good husband is something, and
                    he seems very fond of you.â Mrs. Sutton tried hard to say this, as if she really
                    believed the fact.</p>
                <p>âYesâyes, Pietro is very kind,â answered the young woman, faintly smiling. âI
                    thought so, or I would not have married him. Shall I tell you how it was?â</p>
                <p>Now this was the climax of all Mrs. Sutton's wishes; but she had self-denial
                    enough to say, âNot if it troubles you, Mrs. Ponti.â</p>
                <p>âI wish you would call me Anne,â said the girl, taking her hand: âyou are the
                    first woman who has seemed to love me since my mother died.â And here she began
                    to weep afresh, but soon recovered herself so as to tell her story: how that she
                    came from York; that<pb n="330" xml:id="VAB7020-333"></pb> she was an only child,
                    and fatherless, and had been left utterly friendless and helpless on her
                    mother's death.</p>
                <p>âIt was during her illness,â Anne continued, âthat Pietro Ponti, who lived in the
                    same house, showed us much kindness. He was so much older than I, he treated me
                    as a father would a child, and helped me out of all my troubles. When I was
                    quite broken-hearted, I heard that he was going away on his usual rounds, and I
                    went to him to ask his advice as to how I could support myself. My poor mother
                    had been a dressmaker; but I was too young to take her business, for I was only
                    seventeen. I felt that I must starve or beg, for I had no money. Then Pietro
                    talked to me quietly and seriously, and told me that there was but one way in
                    which he could maintain me, and save me from povertyâif I would marry him. He
                    said this doubtingly, almost afraid that I would be angry; but I was not, for I
                    saw tears in his eyes when he spoke of my youth and beauty being thrown away on
                    a poor deformed creature like himself. I knew it was all his kindness; and I
                    told him how grateful I was, and that, if he would let me think of it for a
                    week, I would see if I could not make up my mind to be his wife. Pietro asked me
                    if I had any other loverâany one I preferred to him? But I said no; there was no
                    one who seemed to me so good and kind as he. And so, at the end of the week, I
                    married him; and he has ever been a good husband to me. I fear I hardly love him
                    as he deserves; but indeed I try; and I do obey him in all things.â</p>
                <pb n="331" xml:id="VAB7020-334"></pb>
                <p>To this long story Mrs. Sutton had listened without a word. As Anne ended, the
                    good woman pressed her hand, bade âGod bless her!â in rather a husky voice, and
                    muttering a hope that she would stay long with them, and be very happy, went
                    about her household business. But all that day Mrs. Sutton's voiceâat times
                    raised sharply enoughâsounded softer than usual; and when Pietro Ponti came into
                    supper, the best portion of the meal, and the warmest corner of the fireplace,
                    were kindly, though abruptly, bestowed on the little deformed Italian.</p>
                <p>Two or three months passed, and Ponti and his wife became like members of the
                    family. The bird-catcher pursued his trade successfully, being taken to the
                    woodland haunts for miles round by the younger Suttons, with whom he was an
                    especial favourite. They Anglicised his name into Peter, which appellation was
                    soon given him by the whole family. And ten times better than even they liked
                    Peter did they all love the pretty Anne, who seemed so young that she was almost
                    a playmate for the children. But a continual pensiveness darkened her face,
                    though not detracting from its mild beauty. Her husband was always kind, yet
                    still there was a perpetual yearningâa restless void in the girl's heart. How
                    could it be otherwise? She never uttered a word of complaint, or even of
                    sadness; but often, when she sat preparing for the little being that was soon to
                    give her new ties of love, Anne would let the work fall from her hands, while
                    her dark-blue eyes, so dreamy in their depths,<pb n="332" xml:id="VAB7020-335"></pb>
                    were fixed on vacancy, as if looking wistfully into the dim future. Good, plain
                    Mrs. Sutton, could not understand these fancies, and sometimes wished that Anne
                    would think less and talk moreâit would be much better for her.</p>
                <p>Birth and death came hand in hand together. The babe livedâthe mother died!
                    Kind-hearted Mrs. Sutton closed the eyes of the poor young creature who had so
                    twined round her honest heart. She had tended her with a mother's care until the
                    last; when she saw how peaceful and beautiful the dead face looked, the good
                    woman dried her tears.</p>
                <p>âPoor thing!âpoor thing! She has nothing to trouble her now! Perhaps it is as
                    wellâGod knows best!â</p>
                <p>And then Mrs. Suttoin heard the wail of the little motherless babe, and for a
                    time forgot the dead in her care over the living.</p>
                <p>âCharley is six months old now,â she said to her husband. âHe is strong and
                    healthy; I shall turn him away, and take this poor little creature, who wants
                    the most.â</p>
                <p>So she nursed the babe, and became a mother to it in the stead of her who had now
                    no need of the comfort of a child. Many a time, when the little one grew older,
                    and began to laugh and crow in her arms, Mrs. Sutton would think of its dead
                    mother; how Anne's heart would have leaped to feel the bliss of maternal
                    loveâthe tiny, twining fingersâthe kiss of the little soft lips. But then she
                    would remember that a<pb n="333" xml:id="VAB7020-336"></pb> child's love is not
                    all-sufficient, and that, perhaps, it was well for poor Anne that she lived no
                    longer.</p>
                <p>Whether the widower grieved much for the loss of his sweet young wife it was
                    impossible to tell. The Italian was always of a reserved disposition; and when
                    the first shock was over, he seemed to return to his old habits much as if
                    nothing had happened. His taciturnity increased; and sometimes, after spending
                    the day out in the fields, he came home, silently took his place in his own warm
                    corner, and uttered not a syllable until it was time to go to rest. He rarely
                    noticed his child, except that when Mrs. Sutton began to talk to him about the
                    name of the babe, hinting that, as a matter of course, the little one should be
                    christened Anne, Pietro shrank from her with an expression of acute pain, and at
                    once said, âNo:âthat the child should be called Ginevra.â</p>
                <p>âJenny what?â cried Mrs. Sutton, aghast at this foreign appellation.</p>
                <p>âGinevra!â said the Italian, lingering on the melodious syllables as if it were a
                    name long unuttered, but most dear, and saying it over and over again, coupled
                    with the tender and musical diminutives of his own language. All this was
                    incomprehensible to the worthy woman, and she tried again to protest against âso
                    unchristian and heathenish a name.â But the only answer she gained was the
                    distinct repetition of the name, in a tone so firm that she saw it was useless
                    to dispute the father's will. As a contest of words between herself and the
                    foreigner would have<pb n="334" xml:id="VAB7020-337"></pb> been highly unprofitable
                    to both, Mrs. Sutton wisely yielded her point, probably for the first time in
                    her life. So the babe was christened Ginevra; but Mrs. Sutton, determined to
                    make the baptismal name void, gave to her nursling the pet diminutive of Jenny;
                    and Jenny she was called evermore by the household.</p>
                <p>The child grew up as a younger sister in the family: no one seemed to look upon
                    her in any other light. She learned to call her nurse âmother,â and John Sutton
                    âfather;â while her own father was âPeter,â as he was called by the rest of the
                    children. Nor did the Italian seem to care for the abolition of these parental
                    ties; he treated his own daughter just as he did the little Suttons, with
                    neither more nor less regard than he had ever shown to them. Only he always
                    called her Ginevra; sometimes adding to it sweet diminutives, but these seemed
                    less meant for the child than recollections awakened by the name she bore.</p>
                <p>In truth, as the little girl grew older, no one could have guessed her Italian
                    descent. She was in all respects an English child, with her soft blue eyes and
                    brown hair, like her mother'sâher true motherânow so utterly forgotten, that her
                    very existence was unknown to the child whose life had been her death. Once or
                    twice, smitten in conscience, Mrs. Sutton tried to explain the truth to Jenny;
                    but the mystery was too great for the little girl's mind. And besides, Mrs.
                    Sutton loved her nursling so much, it was a pain to remember she was not her own
                    childâso at last she let the matter rest.</p>
                <pb n="335" xml:id="VAB7020-338"></pb>
                <p>Time passed on; Jenny became of an age to go to school; and to school she was
                    accordingly sent, with her foster brother CharleyâPietro Ponti never interfering
                    in the matter at all. Indeed, from the child's birth, he had seemed to give her
                    up entirely to the Suttons. She was clothed and fed by the honest labourer with
                    his own children; and not a murmur did worthy John Sutton and his equally worthy
                    helpmate utter with regard to the little one thus quartered on them, and
                    dependent on their bounty. In everything she was to them as their own. Oh, there
                    are noble hearts in the dwellings of the English poor! and good deeds, of which
                    the greatest philanthropist might be proud, are often concealed under thatched
                    roofs, and highways, and hedges, unknown and unchronicled, except by the
                    All-seeing.</p>
                <p>When Jenny was ten years old, her father died. They found him one morning lying
                    dead in his bed, in the little room where he slept, and where he taught his
                    birds; rising up at daybreak, whistling and talking to them in his own tongue.
                    The little birds were now warbling joyously, carolling in the sunshine over the
                    pillow of the dead man. Poor Pietro! in life they had been his only companions,
                    and they were the only witnesses of his death. The same kind hands which had
                    laid his wife in her grave now laid her husband beside her; but there was little
                    mourning for him. He had come a stranger, and remained a stranger to the last.
                    For some time Pietro's trade had not prospered, and he had owed his very
                    subsistence to the charity of<pb n="336" xml:id="VAB7020-339"></pb> those whose
                    inmate he had been so long. Now, but for John Sutton, the Italian might have
                    found a parish grave.</p>
                <p>The only treasures left by Pietro Ponti were his birds, a silver crucifix, and a
                    little Italian story-book, in which was written a nameâthe name he had given his
                    daughterâGinevra. It might have been his mother's, a sister's, perhaps some
                    early memory still dearer; for the human heart is the same all over the world.
                    But nothing more was ever known of the father of Ginevra Ponti. After a time,
                    Mrs. Sutton explained to her adopted child as much of her history as she knew
                    herself, and then, clasping Jenny in her arms, told her that she need think of
                    it no more, for that she was henceforth her own daughter.</p>
                <p>Two years or more passed away; the sons and daughters of Mrs. Sutton grew up: one
                    girl married; two boys went awayâanother turned out ill, and gave many a gnawing
                    care to his parents. It was a hard time for trade, and anxieties came heavily
                    upon John Sutton, yet he never complained of the additional burden which he had
                    in his adopted child: the idea never crossed his mind, nor his wife's either.
                    They seemed to think that Jenny was always to live with them; to send her away
                    would be like parting with their own. That any one should claim her was equally
                    improbable; but strange things happen sometimes.</p>
                <p>One day a visitor, who appeared not exactly a lady, though she was very well
                    dressed, came to inquire for Mrs. Sutton.</p>
                <pb n="337" xml:id="VAB7020-340"></pb>
                <p>âI wanted to speak to you,â she said abruptly. âMy name is Dalton.âMiss Dalton.â
                    Mrs. Sutton started. âYou seem to know the name!â</p>
                <p>âI have heard it before,â answered Mrs. Sutton, briefly and rather grimly, being
                    struck with a presentiment which was either pleasure or dreadâshe knew not
                    which.</p>
                <p>âI don't belong to these parts,â continued Miss Dalton, in a tone that, if not
                    exactly refined, sounded honest and straightforward; âbut in crossing that
                    churchyard, I saw a stone with the name of Anne Meredith Ponti. Now, I have been
                    long looking for my brother's child, of whom I only know that her name was Anne
                    Meredith Dalton, and that she married a wandering Italian called Ponti. The
                    sexton sent me to you for information.â</p>
                <p>Though incensed at the imperative tone of her visitor, Mrs. Sutton honestly
                    related all she knew.</p>
                <p>âIt must have been my niece,â said Miss Dalton, musingly. Mrs. Sutton began to
                    speak of poor Anneâwhat she was like in person; but the latter stopped her
                    quicklyââYou need not describe her, as I never saw her; but let me look at the
                    child.â</p>
                <p>Jenny came, was much admired, and at last acknowledged in favour of her mouth and
                    chin, which were, the lady avouched, exactly those of a Dalton. She at once
                    declared her intention of talking away her niece, to educate and adopt.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Sutton was perfectly overwhelmed! To part with Jenny, her darling Jenny, was
                    a thing dreadful<pb n="338" xml:id="VAB7020-341"></pb> even to imagine. She burst
                    into tears, snatched the child to her bosom, and ran away with her out of the
                    house.</p>
                <p>But with calm reflection came a dread of the injury she might be doing to Jenny's
                    interests in thus keeping her to share the poverty which was coming darkly on,
                    when she might be made a lady of by one to whom she was bound by ties of
                    kindred. The simple-hearted but upright woman thought of all this, until she was
                    well-nigh bewildered; and then she had to convince her husband, too. But Mary
                    Sutton was a woman who, through prejudice and ignorance, possessed that rare
                    faculty of seeing <emph>the right</emph>, and of acting up to what she saw. The
                    end was, that within a week the adopted parents of the little Jenny consented to
                    Miss Dalton's proposition.</p>
                <p>âIf she should come to any harm,â cried the poor woman, folding her darling to
                    her heart in the agony of a parting which Jenny could hardly comprehendââif you
                    do not teach her what is right, and be kind to her, I shall never forgive
                    myself.â</p>
                <p>Miss Dalton promised, with an earnestness and sincerity which was proved by her
                    moistened eyes and softened voice, that she would try to be as good a mother to
                    the orphan as the excellent woman who had nurtured Jenny for so many years. Then
                    she took the child away; and Jenny's sweet face was seen no more among those of
                    her adopted brothers and sisters. From the far distant home to which she was
                    taken came her childish letters, every line of which was wept<pb n="339" xml:id="VAB7020-342"></pb> over, though with some self-reproach, since Jenny
                    said she was âso happy!â But year by year they grew less frequent; and at last
                    altogether ceased. A neighbour once passing through the town, tried to get a
                    sight of her, but failed; and though the circumstance brought a few tears to
                    Mrs. Sutton's eyes, and a pain to her heart, at the thought of her darling
                    having forgotten her, still the regret soon passed away. The poor have no time
                    for much sentiment, and Mrs. Sutton was engrossed by her own thickly-gathering
                    cares.</p>
                <p>It is all very well for political economists and theoretical philanthropists to
                    talk about the wisdom of laying up for old age, and providing against the evil
                    day; but for a labouring man, whose weekly earnings only suffice to provide
                    weekly food for the many little mouths that must be filled, the matter is
                    extremely difficult. Many and many an honest man, who has brought up a large
                    family, which has not requited his care, is thrown upon parish charity in his
                    old age. It was not quite so bad as this with John Sutton; but still, when all
                    their young nestlings were fledged, and had gone out into the wide worldâsome
                    for good, and some for evilâthe parents were left, aged, solitary, and poor.</p>
                <p>âAh, if Keziah had but stayed!â lamented the poor old mother, while the prettiest
                    of the twins stole away one fine morning, and secretly married a worthless young
                    man, leaving her parents deprived of the few comforts which her earnings, as the
                    last of the flock, had brought them.</p>
                <p>âChildren always turn out so,â angrily said John<pb n="340" xml:id="VAB7020-343"></pb> Sutton. âand we that were fools enough to bring up another body's child, too;
                    much good <emph>she</emph> has been, either.â</p>
                <p>âDon't say that, John,â answered Mrs. Sutton, and her voice was gentler than it
                    had once been: trouble is a great softener sometimes. âI will never believe it
                    was poor Jenny's fault; and anyhow, we did what was right, and that ought to be
                    comfort to us.â</p>
                <p>It was years since the name of the Italian's daughter had been mentioned by the
                    Suttons. The wounded feelings of the old man had brought up the subject now, and
                    his wife could not drive it from her mind. Her own daughter's unkindness made
                    her think of the little gentle creature whom she had loved so much, and who had
                    ever been willing and dutiful, far more so than her own wild troop of children.
                    As the old woman knelt before her hearth, kneading the dough for the one loaf
                    which was sufficient now for their weekly need, her thoughts went back twenty
                    years, wandering, by a natural train of ideas, to the pile of bread she had used
                    to bake when the cottage was filled with merry children, now scattered far and
                    wide. In fancy, she saw little Jenny standing by her side, burying her round,
                    rosy arms in the dough, as she was so fond of doingâand the good woman stopped
                    to wipe her eyes, which these old memeories made dim.</p>
                <p>âPoor Jenny, if she could but come back, and be as she used to be. But that's
                    quite impossible,â thought Mrs. Sutton with a heavy sigh.</p>
                <p>Life is more full of strange coincidences than we are<pb n="341" xml:id="VAB7020-344"></pb> aware. How often, on meeting unexpectedly some dear,
                    long-lost friend, do we remember that our thoughts had, only the day before,
                    with a curious wilfulness, persisted in bringing up the very face we were so
                    soon to see, and we laugh, and say, âWhat an odd chance it was!â As if there
                    were such a thing as chance in this world!</p>
                <p>Little did Mrs. Sutton think, as she got the tea ready, that when she and her
                    good man went to rest that night it would be with the happy knowledge that the
                    dear lost Jenny was once more sleeping under their roof. But so it was.</p>
                <p>While they sat at their homely meal the latch was lifted, a young girl's face
                    appeared, and a sweet voice said, âMay I come in, <emph>mother</emph>?â</p>
                <p>â<emph>Mother</emph>!ââWho could it be? Alas, not the erring Keziah; nor yet the
                    other twin, Ednaâher home was beyond the Atlantic. It was the child of their
                    adoption, the long lost Jenny.</p>
                <p>What a tea-drinking that was! The old couple forgot all their cares in the
                    delight of welcoming her. They were never weary of looking at and admiring
                    Jenny, now grown a tall and graceful woman, like what her mother had been. But
                    the sadness that had darkened the face of poor Anne was not found in her
                    daughter's.</p>
                <p>After the first delight was passed, Mrs. Sutton said mournfully, âBut we shall
                    not have you long, Jenny: you are a rich lady now, I suppose?â</p>
                <p>Jenny put her arm round the neck of her old nurse,<pb n="342" xml:id="VAB7020-345"></pb> and whispered, merrily, âDear mother, I am not a
                    lady; and I am as poor as Job: and I will never go away from you again, if you
                    will let me stay.â</p>
                <p>And then she told at length, what we must relate in a few words, how her aunt,
                    who was a prosperous dress-maker in a large city, as Jenny grew a woman, had
                    made her cease all communication with the Suttons. They were ânot respectable
                    enough.â It was only the accident of the neighbour's inquiring for her that
                    brought to Jenny any news of them or their troubles.</p>
                <p>âThen,â said the young girl, deeply blushing, âI thought how wicked and
                    ungrateful I must seem to you; and I asked my aunt to let me come and see you,
                    but she refused. I could not rest; I was very miserable. But she fell ill, and I
                    thought it would be wrong to leave herâso I tended her six months, until she
                    died.â</p>
                <p>âAnd what became of the business?â asked Mrs. Sutton, who had not lost her
                    prudence, especially for those she loved. âShe promised me to provide for you,
                    Jenny. How comes it you're âas poor as Job?ââ</p>
                <p>Jenny hung her head. âShe told me I should have all she hadâifâif I would never
                    come near you again. Soââadded the girl simply, clinging fondly to her adopted
                    parentsââshe left her money and the business to some one else, and I have got to
                    earn my living. Never mindâI am a capital dress-maker. I'll make a fortune, now
                    I am come back to you.â</p>
                <p>âAnd how did you comeâall alone, poor child?â</p>
                <pb n="343" xml:id="VAB7020-346"></pb>
                <p>âI walked almost all the way, for I had hardly any money. Oh, mother, don't cryâI
                    am so happy! You shall never want a child, nor I a mother, any more!â Nor did
                    theyâone or other of them. Jenny worked skilfully at the dress-making; and
                    though she never âmade a fortune,â she kept the aged pair in plenty till they
                    died. It was none of their own children, but the adopted one, who closed their
                    eyes.</p>
                <p>And, as afterwards it came to pass that Jenny, like many another of the good
                    womenânay, the best women of this worldânever married, she, in her turn, adopted
                    a desolate babyâKeziah's orphan child. Thus the blessing of a good deed came
                    down even to the third generation.</p>
