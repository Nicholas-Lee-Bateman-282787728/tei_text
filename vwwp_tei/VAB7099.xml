                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, "verse paragraph"s, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag,
                    with the value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All
                    split lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for
                    the final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as
                    &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>
                <p>The publisher's advertisement, beginning after p. 283, has been omitted.</p>

                    <l>I stood beside her. No one heard. On the great rajahâs bed, alone</l>
                    <l>She lay. The nightâbreeze softly stirred the Cashmere curtains, and the
                        moan</l>
                    <l>Of my wild kisses seemed to thrill the solitude. All else was still.</l>

                    <l>The thin hands folded on her breast, in peace at last, and perfect rest!</l>

                <head>A DREAM OF VENICE.</head>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l><hi>NUMB</hi>, half asleep, and dazed with whirl of wheels,</l>
                    <l>And gasp of steam, and measured clank of chains,</l>
                    <l>I heard a blithe voice break a sudden pause,</l>
                    <l>Ringing familiarly through the lampâlit night,</l>
                    <l>âWife, hereâs your Venice!â</l>
                    <l>I was lifted down,</l>
                    <l>And gazed about in stupid wonderment,</l>
                    <l>Holding my little Katie by the handâ</l>
                    <l>My yellowâhaired stepâdaughter. And again</l>
                    <l>Two strong arms led me to the waterâbrink,</l>
                    <l>And laid me on soft cushions in a boat,â</l>
                    <l>A queer boat, by a queerer boatman mannedâ</l>
                    <l>Swarthyâfaced, ragged, with a scarlet capâ</l>
                    <pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7099-040"/>
                    <l>Whose wild, weird note smote shrilly through the dark.</l>
                    <l>Oh yes, it was my Venice! Beautiful,</l>
                    <l>With melancholy, ghostly beautyâold,</l>
                    <l>And sorrowful, and wearyâyet so fair,</l>
                    <l>So like a queen still, with her royal robes,</l>
                    <l>Full of harmonious colour, rent and worn!</l>
                    <l>I only saw her shadow in the stream,</l>
                    <l>By flickering lamplight,âonly saw, as yet,</l>
                    <l>White, misty palaceâportals here and there,</l>
                    <l>Pillars, and marble steps, and balconies,</l>
                    <l>Along the broad line of the Grand Canal;</l>
                    <l>And, in the smaller waterâways, a patch</l>
                    <l>Of wall, or dim bridge arching overhead.</l>
                    <l>But I could <emph rend="i">feel</emph> the rest. âTwas Venice!âay,</l>
                    <l>The veritable Venice of my dreams.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>I saw the grey dawn shimmer down the stream,</l>
                    <l>And all the city rise, new bathed in light,</l>
                    <l>With roseâred blooms on her decaying walls,</l>
                    <pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7099-041"/>
                    <l>And gold tints quivering up her domes and spiresâ</l>
                    <l>Sharpâdrawn, with delicate pencillings, on a sky</l>
                    <l>Blue as forgetâmeânots in June. I saw</l>
                    <l>The broad day staring in her palaceâfronts,</l>
                    <l>Pointing to yawning gap and crumbling boss,</l>
                    <l>And colonnades, timeâstained and broken, flecked</l>
                    <l>With soft, sad, dying coloursâsculptureâwreathed,</l>
                    <l>And gloriously proportioned; saw the glow</l>
                    <l>Light up her bright, harmonious, fountainâd squares,</l>
                    <l>And spread out on her marble steps, and pass</l>
                    <l>Down silent courts and secret passages,</l>
                    <l>Gathering up motley treasures on its way;â</l>
                    <l>Groups of rich fruit from the Rialto mart,</l>
                    <l>Scarlet and brown and purple, with green leavesâ</l>
                    <l>Fragments of exquisite carving, lichenâgrown,</l>
                    <l>Found, âmid pathetic squalor, in some niche</l>
                    <l>Where wild, halfânaked urchins lived and playedâ</l>
                    <l>A bright robe, crowned with a pale, darkâeyed faceâ</l>
                    <l>A redâstriped awning âgainst and old grey wallâ</l>
                    <l>A delicate opal gleam upon the tide.</l>
                    <pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7099-042"/>
                    <l>I looked out from my window, and I saw</l>
                    <l>Venice, my Venice, naked in the sunâ</l>
                    <l>Sad, faded, and unutterably forlorn!â</l>
                    <l>But still unutterably beautiful.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>For days and days I wandered up and downâ</l>
                    <l>Holding my breath in awe and ecstasy,â</l>
                    <l>Following my husband to familiar haunts,</l>
                    <l>Making acquaintance with his wellâloved friends,</l>
                    <l>Whose faces I had only seen in dreams</l>
                    <l>And books and photographs and his careless talk.</l>
                    <l>For days and daysâwith sunny hours of rest</l>
                    <l>And musing chat, in that cool room of ours,</l>
                    <l>Paved with white marble, on the Grand Canal;</l>
                    <l>For days and daysâwith happy nights between,</l>
                    <l>Halfâspent, while little Katie lay asleep</l>
                    <l>Out on the balcony, with the moon and stars.</l>

                    <l>Sleeping, faceâdownward, on the sunny stepsâ</l>
                    <l>Thy fairy islands floating in the sunâ</l>

                    <l>And many a passionate thrill into my heart,</l>
                    <l>And once a tangled dream into my head.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>âTwixt afternoon and evening. I was tired;</l>
                    <l>The air was hot and goldenânot a breath</l>
                    <l>Of wind until the sunsetâhot and still.</l>
                    <l>Our floor was waterâsprinkled; our thick walls</l>
                    <l>And open doors and windows, shadowed deep</l>
                    <l>With jalousies and awnings, made a cool</l>
                    <l>And grateful shadow for my little couch.</l>
                    <l>A subtle perfume stole about the room</l>
                    <l>From a small table, piled with purple grapes,</l>
                    <l>And waterâmelon slices, pink and wet,</l>
                    <l>And ripe, sweet figs, and golden apricots,</l>
                    <l>Newâlaid on green leaves from our gardenâleaves</l>
                    <l>Wherewith an antique torso had been clothed.</l>
                    <l>My husband read his novel on the floor,</l>
                    <l>Propped up on cushions and an Indian shawl;</l>
                    <l>And little Katie slumbered at his feet,</l>
                    <l>Her yellow curls alight, and delicate tints</l>

                    <l>Of colour in the white folds of her frock.</l>
                    <l>I lay, and mused, in comfort and at ease,</l>
                    <l>Watching them both and playing with my thoughts;</l>
                    <l>And then I fell into a long, deep sleep,</l>
                    <l>And dreamed.</l>
                    <l>I saw a waterâwildernessâ</l>
                    <l>Islands entangled in a net of streamsâ</l>
                    <l>Crossâthreads of rippling channels, woven through</l>
                    <l>Bare sands, and shallows glimmering blue and broadâ</l>
                    <l>A line of white seaâbreakers far away.</l>
                    <l>There came a smoke and crying from the landâ</l>
                    <l>Ruin was there, and ashes, and the blood</l>
                    <l>Of conquered cities, trampled down to death.</l>
                    <l>But here, methought, amid these lonely gulfs,</l>
                    <l>There rose up towers and bulwarks, fair and strong,</l>
                    <l>Lapped in the silver seaâmists;âwaxing aye</l>
                    <l>Fairer and strongerâtill they seemed to mock</l>
                    <l>The broadâbased kingdoms on the mainland shore.</l>
                    <l>I saw a great fleet sailing in the sun,</l>
                    <l>Sailing anear the sandâslip, whereon broke</l>

                    <l>The long white waveâcrests of the outer sea,â</l>
                    <l>Pepin of Lombardy, with his warrior hostsâ</l>
                    <l>Following the bloody steps of Attila!</l>
                    <l>I saw the smoke rise when he touched the towns</l>
                    <l>That lay, outposted, in his ravenous reach;</l>
                    <l>Then, in their <ref target="#manor-note01">island of deep waters</ref>,
                        saw</l>
                    <l>A gallant band defy him to his face,</l>
                    <l>And drive him out, with his fair vessels wrecked</l>
                    <l>And charred with flames, into the sea again.</l>
                    <l>âAh, this is Venice!â I said proudlyââqueen</l>
                    <l>Whose haughty spirit none shall subjugate.â</l>

                    <l>In palpitating ripples down the flood</l>

                    <l>Whiteâbordered now with marble palaces.</l>
                    <l>It was the night. I saw a greyâhaired man,</l>

                    <l>Sitting alone in a dark conventâporchâ</l>
                    <l>In beggarâs garments, with a kingly face,</l>
                    <l>And eyes that watched for dawnlight anxiouslyâ</l>
                    <l>A weary man, who could not rest nor sleep.</l>
                    <l>I heard him muttering prayers beneath his breath,</l>
                    <l>And once a maledictionâwhile the air</l>
                    <l>Hummed with the soft, low psalmâchants from within.</l>
                    <l>And then, as grey gleams yellowed in the east,</l>
                    <l>I saw him bend his venerable head,</l>
                    <l>Creep to the door, and knock.</l>
                    <l>Again I saw</l>
                    <l>The longâdrawn billows breaking on the land,</l>
                    <l>And galleys rocking in the summer noon.</l>

                    <l>In princely robes, stood there, and spread his arms,</l>
                    <l>And cried, to one lowâkneeling at his feet,</l>

                    <l>And again</l>
                    <l>âTwas that long slip of land betwixt the sea</l>
                    <l>And still lagoons of Veniceâcurling waves</l>
                    <l>Flinging light, foamy spray upon the sand.</l>
                    <l>The noon was past, and roseâred shadows fell</l>
                    <l>Across the waters. Lo! the galleys came</l>
                    <l>To anchorage againâand lo! the Duke</l>
                    <l>Yet once more bent his noble head to earth,</l>
                    <l>And laid a victory at the old manâs feet,</l>
                    <l>Praying a blessing with exulting heart.</l>

                    <l>As sign of her subjection, and thy right</l>
                    <l>To be her lord for ever.â</l>
                    <l>Once again</l>
                    <l>I saw that old man,âin the vestibule</l>
                    <pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7099-049"/>
                    <l>Of St. Markâs fair cathedral,âcircled round</l>
                    <l>With cardinals and priests, ambassadors</l>
                    <l>And the noblesse of Veniceârichly robed</l>
                    <l>In papal vestments, with the triple crown</l>
                    <l>Gleaming upon his brows. There was a hush:â</l>
                    <l>I saw a glittering train come sweeping on,</l>
                    <l>From the blue water and across the square,</l>
                    <l>Thronged with an eager multitude,âthe Duke,</l>
                    <l>And with him Barbarossa, humbled now,</l>
                    <l>And fain to pray for pardon. With bare heads,</l>
                    <l>They reached the church, and paused. The Emperor knelt,</l>
                    <l>Casting away his purple mantleâknelt,</l>
                    <l>And crept along the pavement, as to kiss</l>
                    <l>Those feet, which had been weary twenty years</l>
                    <l>With his own persecutions. And the Pope</l>
                    <l>Lifted his white haired, crowned, majestic head,</l>
                    <l>And trod upon his neck,âcrying out to Christ,</l>
                    <l>âUpon the lion and adder shalt thou goâ</l>
                    <l>The dragon shalt thou tread beneath thy feet!â</l>
                    <pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7099-050"/>
                    <l>The vision changed. Sweet incenseâclouds rose up</l>
                    <l>From the cathedral altar, mixâd with hymns</l>
                    <l>And solemn chantings, oâer ten thousand heads;</l>
                    <l>And ebbed and died away along the aisles.</l>
                    <l>I saw a train of noblesâknights of Franceâ</l>
                    <l>Pass âneath the glorious arches through the crowd,</l>
                    <l>And stand, with halo of soft, coloured light</l>
                    <l>On their fair browsâthe while their leaderâs voice</l>
                    <l>Rang through the throbbing silence like a bell.</l>
                    <l>âSigniors, we come to Venice, by the will</l>
                    <l>Of the most high and puissant lords of France,</l>
                    <l>To pray you look with your compassionate eyes</l>
                    <l>Upon the Holy City of our Christâ</l>
                    <l>Wherein He lived, and suffered, and was lain</l>
                    <l>Asleep, to wake in glory, for our sakesâ</l>
                    <l>By Paynim dogs dishonoured and defiled!</l>
                    <l>Signiors, we come to you, for you are strong.</l>
                    <l>The seas which lie betwixt that land and this</l>
                    <l>Obey you. O have pity! See, we kneelâ</l>
                    <l>Our Masters bid us kneelâand bid us stay</l>
                    <pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7099-051"/>
                    <l>Here at your feet until you grant our prayers!â</l>
                    <l>Wherewith the knights fell down upon their knees,</l>
                    <l>And lifted up their supplicating hands.</l>
                    <l>Lo! the ten thousand people rose as one,</l>
                    <l>And shouted with a shout that shook the domes</l>
                    <l>And gleaming roofs above themâechoing down,</l>
                    <l>Through marble pavements, to the shrine below,</l>
                    <l>Where lay the miraculous body of their Saint</l>
                    <l>(Shed he not heavenly radiance as he heard?â</l>
                    <l>Perfuming the damp air of his secret crypt),</l>
                    <l>And cried, with an exceeding mighty cry,</l>
                    <l>âWe do consent! We will be pitiful!â</l>
                    <l>The thunder of their voices reached the sea,</l>
                    <l>And thrilled through all the netted waterâveins</l>
                    <l>Of their rich city. Silence fell anon,</l>
                    <l>Slowly, with fluttering wings, upon the crowd;</l>
                    <l>And then a veil of darkness.</l>
                    <l>And again</l>
                    <l>The filtered sunlight streamed upon those walls,</l>
                    <l>Marbled and sculptured with divinest grace;</l>
                    <pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7099-052"/>
                    <l>Again I saw a multitude of heads,</l>
                    <l>Softâwreathed with cloudy incense, bent in prayerâ</l>
                    <l>The heads of haughty barons, armÃ¨d knights</l>
                    <l>And pilgrims girded with their staff and scrip,</l>
                    <l>The warriors of the Holy Sepulchre.</l>
                    <l>The music died away along the roof;</l>
                    <l>The hush was brokenânot by him of Franceâ</l>
                    <l>By Enrico Dandolo, whose grey head</l>
                    <l>Venice had circled with the ducal crown.</l>
                    <l>The old man looked down, with his dim, wise eyes,</l>
                    <l>Stretching his hands abroad, and spake. âSeigneurs,</l>
                    <l>My children, seeâyour vessels lie in port</l>
                    <l>Freighted for battle. And you, standing here,</l>
                    <l>Wait but the first fair wind. The bravest hosts</l>
                    <l>Are with you, and the noblest enterprise</l>
                    <l>Conceived of man. Behold, I am greyâhaired,</l>
                    <l>And old and feeble. Yet am I your lord.</l>
                    <l>And, if it be your pleasure, I will trust</l>
                    <l>My ducal seat in Venice to my son,</l>
                    <l>And be your guide and leader.â</l>
                    <pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7099-053"/>
                    <l>When they heard,</l>
                    <l>They cried aloud, âIn Godâs name, go with us!â</l>
                    <l>And the old man, with holy weeping, passed</l>
                    <l>Adown the tribune to the altarâsteps;</l>
                    <l>And, kneeling, fixed the cross upon his cap.</l>
                    <l>A ray of sudden sunshine lit his faceâ</l>
                    <l>The grand, grey, furrowed faceâand lit the cross,</l>
                    <l>Until it twinkled like a cross of fire.</l>
                    <l>âWe shall be safe with<emph rend="i">him</emph>,â the people said,</l>
                    <l>Straining their wet, bright eyes; âand we shall reap</l>
                    <l>Harvests of glory from our battleâfields!â</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Anon there rose a vapour from the seaâ</l>
                    <l>A dim white mist, that thickened into fog.</l>
                    <l>The campanile and columns were blurred out,</l>
                    <l>Cathedral domes and spires, and colonnades</l>
                    <l>Of marble palaces on the Grand Canal.</l>
                    <l>Joyâbells rang sadly and softlyâfar away;</l>
                    <l>Banners of welcome waved like windâblown clouds;</l>
                    <pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7099-054"/>
                    <l>Glad shouts were muffled into mournful wails.</l>
                    <l>A Doge was come to be enthroned and crowned,â</l>
                    <l>Not in the great Bucentaurânot in pomp;</l>
                    <l>The waterâways had wandered in the mist,</l>
                    <l>And he had tracked them, slowly, painfully,</l>
                    <l>From San Clemente to Venice, in a frail</l>
                    <l>And humble gondola. A Doge was come;</l>
                    <l>But he, alas! had missed his landingâplace,</l>
                    <l>And set his foot upon the bloodâstained stones</l>
                    <l>Betwixt the bloodâred columns. Ah, the seaâ</l>
                    <l>The bride, the queenâshe was the first to turn</l>
                    <l>Against her passionate, proud, illâfated lord!</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Slowly the seaâfog melted, and I saw</l>
                    <l>Long, limp dead bodies dangling in the sun.</l>
                    <l>Two granite pillars towered on either side,</l>
                    <l>And broad blue waters glittered at their feet.</l>
                    <l>âThese are the traitors,â said the people; âthey</l>
                    <l>Who, with our Lord the Duke, would overthrow</l>
                    <l>The government of Venice.â</l>
                    <pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7099-055"/>
                    <l>And anon,</l>
                    <l>The doors about the palace were made fast.</l>
                    <l>A great crowd gathered round them, with hushed breath</l>
                    <l>And throbbing pulses. And I knew their lord,</l>
                    <l>The Duke Faliero, knelt upon his knees,</l>
                    <l>On the broad landing of the marble stairs</l>
                    <l>Where he had sworn the oath he could not keepâ</l>
                    <l>Vexed with the tyrannous oligarchic rule</l>
                    <l>That held his haughty spirit netted in,</l>
                    <l>And cut so keenly that he writhed and chafed</l>
                    <l>Until he burst the meshesâcould not keep!</l>
                    <l>I watched and waited, feeling sick at heart;</l>
                    <l>And then I saw a figure, robed in blackâ</l>
                    <l>One of their dark, ubiquitous, supreme</l>
                    <l>And fearful tribunal of Tenâcome forth,</l>
                    <l>And hold a dripping swordâblade in the air.</l>
                    <l>âJustice has fallen on the traitor! See,</l>
                    <l>His blood has paid the forfeit of his crime!â</l>
                    <l>And all the people, hearing, murmured deep,</l>
                    <pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7099-056"/>
                    <l>Cursing their dead lord, and the council, too,</l>
                    <l>Whose swift, sure, heavy hand had dealt his death.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Then came the night, all grey and still and sad.</l>
                    <l>I saw a few red torches flare and flame</l>
                    <l>Over a little gondola, where lay</l>
                    <l>The headless body of the traitor Duke,</l>
                    <l>Stripped of his ducal vestments. Floating down</l>
                    <l>The quiet waters, it passed out of sight,</l>
                    <l>Bearing him to unhonoured burial.</l>
                    <l>And then came mist and darkness.</l>
                    <l>Lo! I heard</l>
                    <l>The shrill clang of alarmâbells, and the wails</l>
                    <l>Of men and women in the wakened streets.</l>
                    <l>A thousand torches flickered up and down,</l>
                    <l>Lighting their ghastly faces and bare heads;</l>
                    <l>The while they crowded to the open doors</l>
                    <l>Of all the churchesâto confess their sins,</l>
                    <l>To pray for absolution, and a last</l>

                    <l>But great Pisaniâs blithe word of command,</l>
                    <l>The dip of oars, and creak of beams and chains,</l>

                    <l>I heard Napoleonâs cannon at her gates,</l>

                    <l>Ye turned and groaned for pity in your graves.</l>
                    <l>I saw the flames devour her Golden Book</l>

                    <l>I saw the Lionâs legend blotted out,</l>

                    <l>Dandoloâs brazen horses borne awayâ</l>

                    <l>Following the track of vanished gondolas:â</l>
                    <l>The flutter of a figâleaf in the wind,</l>

                    <l>The voice of dreaming Katie crooning out</l>
                    <l>A snatch of melody that the Austrian band</l>
                    <l>Played in San Marcoâs Place some hours agone,</l>
                    <l>While patriots, âneath their shadowy colonnades,</l>
                    <l>Sauntered, and shut their ears, and ate their hearts:â</l>
                    <l>A measured footstep, pacing to and froâ</l>

                    <l>The brush of two strong hands upon my browsâ</l>

                    <l><hi>AN</hi> evening all aglow with summer light</l>
                    <l>And autumn colourâfairest of the year.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>The wheatâfields, crowned with shocks of tawny gold,</l>
                    <l>All interspersed with rough sowthistle roots,</l>
                    <l>And interlaced with white convolvulus,</l>
                    <l>Lay, flecked with purple shadows, in the sun.</l>
                    <l>The shouts of little children, gleaning there</l>
                    <l>The scattered ears and wild blueâbottle flowersâ</l>
                    <l>Mixed with the cornâcrakeâs crying, and the song</l>
                    <l>Of lone wood birds whose motherâcares were oâer,</l>
                    <l>And with the whispering rustle of red leavesâ</l>
                    <l>Scarce stirred the stillness. And the gossamer sheen</l>
                    <l>Was spread on upland meadows, silver bright</l>

                    <l>In low red sunshine and soft kissing windâ</l>
                    <l>Showing where angels in the night had trailed</l>
                    <l>Their garments on the turf. Tall arrowâheads,</l>
                    <l>With flag and rush and fringing grasses, dropped</l>
                    <l>Their seeds and blossoms in the sleepy pool.</l>
                    <l>The waterâlily lay on her green leaf,</l>
                    <l>White, fair, and stately; while an amorous branch</l>
                    <l>Of silver willow, drooping in the stream,</l>
                    <l>Sent soft, lowâbabbling ripples towards her:</l>

                    <l>Of nightingales and tender coo of dovesâ</l>
                    <l>They stood all flushed and kindling âneath the touch</l>
                    <l>Of deathâkind death!âfair, fond, reluctant death!</l>
                    <l>A dappled mass of glory!</l>
                    <l>Harvestâtime;</l>

                    <l>âMid crumpled ferns and delicate blue harebells.</l>
                    <l>The orchardâapples rolled in seedy grassâ</l>
                    <l>Apples of gold, and violetâvelvet plums;</l>
                    <l>And all the tangled hedgerows bore a crop</l>

                    <l>Of scarlet hips, blue sloes, and blackberries,</l>
                    <l>And orange clusters of the mountain ash.</l>
                    <l>The crimson fungus and soft mosses clung</l>
                    <l>To old decaying trunks; the summer bine</l>
                    <l>Drooped, shivering, in the glossy ivyâs grasp.</l>
                    <l>By day the blue air bore upon its wings</l>
                    <l>Wideâwandering seeds, pale drifts of thistleâdown;</l>
                    <l>By night the fog crept low upon the earth,</l>
                    <l>All white and cool, and calmed its feverishness.</l>
                    <l>And veiled it over with a veil of tears.</l>
                    <l>The curlew and the plover were come back</l>
                    <l>To still, bleak shores; the little summer birds</l>
                    <l>Were goneâto Persian gardens, and the groves</l>
                    <l>Of Greece and Italy, and the palmy lands.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">

                    <l>Chiming the same soft chimeâthe lullaby</l>
                    <l>Of cradled rooks and blinking bats and owls;</l>

                    <l>A wide churchyard, with grassy slopes and nooks,</l>

                    <l>Just caught at here and there amongst the green</l>
                    <l>Of flowering shrubs and sweet limeâavenues.</l>
                    <l>An old house standing nearâa parsonageâhouseâ</l>
                    <l>With broad thatched roof and overhanging eaves,</l>
                    <l>Oâer run with banksia roses,âa low house,</l>
                    <l>With ivied windows and a latticed porch,</l>
                    <l>Shut in a tiny Paradise, all sweet</l>

                    <l>And, as we lay, we talked of college daysâ</l>
                    <l>Wild, racing, hunting, steepleâchasing days;</l>
                    <l>Of river reaches, fishingâgrounds, and weirs,</l>
                    <l>Bats, gloves, debates, and inâhumanities:</l>

                    <l>And then of boonâcompanions of those days,</l>
                    <l>How lost and scattered, married, changed, and dead;</l>
                    <l>Until he flung his arm across his face,</l>
                    <l>And feigned to slumber.</l>
                    <l>He was changed, my friend;</l>
                    <l>Not like the manâthe leader of his setâ</l>
                    <l>The favourite of the collegeâthat I knew.</l>
                    <l>And more than time had changed him. He had been</l>
                    <l>âA little wild,â the Lady Alice said;</l>
                    <l>âA little gay, as all young men will be</l>
                    <l>At first, before they settle down to lifeâ</l>
                    <l>While they have money, health, and no restraint,</l>
                    <l>Nor any work to do.â Ah, yes! But this</l>
                    <l>Was mystery unexplainedâthat he was sad</l>
                    <l>And still and thoughtful, like an aged man;</l>
                    <l>And scarcely thirty. With a winsome flash,</l>
                    <l>The old bright heart would shine out here and there;</l>
                    <l>But aye to be oâer shadowed and hushed down,</l>
                    <l>As he had hushed it now.</l>
                    <l>His dog lay near,</l>

                    <l>With long, sharp muzzle resting on his paws,</l>

                    <l>A deerhound of illustrious race, all grey</l>
                    <l>And grizzled, with soft, wrinkled, velvet ears;</l>
                    <l>A gaunt, gigantic, wolfishâlooking brute,</l>

                    <l>âThere, there,â said he,</l>

                    <l>âNo, but I felt his eyes;</l>
                    <l>They are such sharp, wise eyesâpersistent eyesâ</l>
                    <l>Perpetually reproachful. Look at them;</l>

                    <l>But, wondering, turned my talk upon his breed.</l>
                    <l>And was he of the famed Glengarry stock?</l>
                    <l>And in what season was he entered? Where,</l>

                    <l>Of sudden pain or restlessness; and sighed.</l>

                    <l>Old Tom and I were stalking on the hills,</l>
                    <l>Near seven years ago. Bad luck was ours;</l>
                    <l>For we had searched up corrie, glen, and burn,</l>
                    <l>From earliest daybreakâwading to the waist</l>
                    <l>Peatârift and purple heatherâall in vain!</l>
                    <l>We struck a track nigh every hour, to lose</l>
                    <l>A noble quarry by ignoble chanceâ</l>
                    <l>The crowing of a grouseâcock, or the flight</l>

                    <l>Or subtle, hairâs breadth veering of the wind.</l>

                    <l>On far grey peaks, and the green valley spread</l>
                    <l>Beneath us. We had climbed a ridge, and lay</l>
                    <l>Debating in low whispers of our plans</l>
                    <l>For night and morning. Golden eagles sailed</l>
                    <l>Above our heads; the wild ducks swam about</l>
                    <l>Amid the reeds and rushes of the pools;</l>
                    <l>A lonely heron stood on one long leg</l>
                    <l>In shallow water, watching for a meal;</l>
                    <l>And there, to windward, couching in the grass</l>
                    <l>That fringed the blue edge of a sleeping lochâ</l>
                    <l>Waiting for dusk to feed and drinkâthere lay</l>
                    <l>A herd of deer.</l>

                    <l>A mountain storm of sweeping mist and rain</l>
                    <l>Came down upon us. It passed by, and left</l>
                    <l>The burnies swollen that we had to cross;</l>
                    <l>And left us barely light enough to see</l>
                    <l>The broad, black, branching antlers, clustering still</l>
                    <l>Amid the long grass in the valley.</l>

                    <l>And over two big deerhoundsâancestors</l>
                    <l>Of this our old companion. There was light</l>
                    <l>And warmth, a welcome and a heather bed,</l>
                    <l>At Colinâs cottage; with a meal of eggs</l>
                    <l>And fresh trout, broiled by dainty little hands,</l>
                    <l>And sweetest milk and oatcake. There were songs</l>
                    <l>And Gaelic legends, and long talk of deerâ</l>
                    <l>Mixt with a sweet, low laughter, and the whir</l>

                    <l>Not like the other lassiesâcottage folk;</l>
                    <l>For there was subtle trace of gentle blood</l>
                    <l>Through all her beauty and in all her ways.</l>
                    <l>(The motherâs race was âpoor and proud,â they said).</l>
                    <l>Ay, she was fair, my darling! with her shy,</l>
                    <l>Brown, innocent face and delicateâshapen limbs.</l>
                    <l>She had the tenderest mouth you ever saw,</l>
                    <l>And grey, dark eyes, and broad, straightâpencillâd brows;</l>

                    <l>Dark chestnut braids that knotted up the light,</l>
                    <l>As soft as satin. You could scarcely hear</l>
                    <l>Her step, or hear the rustling of her gown,</l>
                    <l>Or the soft hovering motion of her hands</l>
                    <l>At household work. She seemed to bring a spell</l>
                    <l>Of tender calm and silence where she came.</l>
                    <l>You <emph rend="i">felt</emph> her presenceâand not by its stir,</l>
                    <l>But by its restfulness. She was a sight</l>
                    <l>To be rememberedâstanding in the straw;</l>
                    <l>A sleepy pup softâcradled in her arms</l>
                    <l>Like any Christian baby; standing still,</l>
                    <l>The while I handled his ungainly limbs.</l>
                    <l>And Colin blustered of the sportâof hounds,</l>
                    <l>Roe ptarmigan, and trout, and ducal deerâ</l>
                    <l>Neâer lifting up that sweet, unconscious face,</l>
                    <l>To see why I was silent. Oh, I would</l>

                    <l>The ordered fashion fitted to our race,</l>

                    <l>And disappointment. Ah, my love! my love!</l>
                    <l>But she was different from the common sort;</l>
                    <l>A peasant, ignorant, simple, undefiled;</l>
                    <l>The child of rugged peasantâparents, taught</l>

                    <l>The riddles of less simple minds than hersâ</l>
                    <l>That sharper, finer, subtler sense of lifeâ</l>

                    <l>And every flow just distancing the ebb.</l>

                    <l>Like some young helpless doe, amongst the fernâ</l>
                    <l>I caught her, and I kissed her mouth and eyes;</l>
                    <l>And with those kisses signed and sealed our fate</l>

                    <l>And parted, silent, in the balmy dusk.</l>
                    <l>We haunted still roeâcoverts, hand in hand,</l>
                    <l>And murmured, under our breath, of love and faith,</l>
                    <l>And swore great oaths for one of us to keep.</l>
                    <l>We sat for hours, with sealÃ¨d lips, and heard</l>
                    <l>The sweet wind whispering as it passed us byâ</l>
                    <l>And heard our own heartsâ music in the hush.</l>

                    <l>And nearer still a brave, brown English face,</l>
                    <l>Bent low, with clear grey eyes and faithful lips</l>
                    <l>That whisperâd, âReine, I love you,â meeting hers.</l>
                    <l>The drowsy sound of laughter and light feet</l>
                    <l>Behind them she could hearâbut the quick throb</l>

                    <l>Should waste its sweetness in these heathen isles.</l>

                    <l>She shudderâd now,âhis diamonds gallâd her worse</l>
