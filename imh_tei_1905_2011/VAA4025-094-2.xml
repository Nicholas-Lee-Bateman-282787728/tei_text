            <p>William Maclure (1763–1840) lived a remarkable yet enigmatic life.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    For more than half a century he effectively pursued his interests in business, science, and social
                    reform on two continents. Born in Ayr, <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>, on October 27, 1763, Maclure studied briefly with a tutor and in public school. In
                    1778 at age fifteen he began his lifelong travels with his first of many visits to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, attending to the American merchandising interests of his father. By 1782 William began
                    his own import-export business when he took a trip to make contacts in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York City</region>
                    </placeName>. That year he joined the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> trading firm of Miller, Hart &amp; Company. Stimulated by the ideas of the American
                    and French revolutions, he spent time in both countries during their times of transformation. In
                    1796 he became a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> citizen and established a residence and a firm, Maclure &amp; Company (later
                    Maclure &amp; Robinson), in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>By 1800 the thirty-seven-year-old Maclure had amassed enough money to permit him to turn his
                    attention to the two growing interests that occupied the rest of his life: the new science of
                    geology and educational reform to improve the lives of the working classes. The next fifteen years
                    found Maclure making geological surveys of the natural resources of Europe and America. With
                    remarkable stamina he collected mineral specimens and rocks from a wide variety of regions. These
                    stretched from the British Isles to Russia, from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, and
                    throughout the eastern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> from the St. Lawrence River to <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> and from the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> to the Atlantic Ocean. As early as
                    1809 when Maclure read his paper "Observations on the Geology of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he had already completed enough scientific exploration to justify his later

            <p>Geology, however, was only one of the passions of the second half of Maclure's life; education was
                    the other. He conceived of education in the broadest sense. He saw political, economic, and social
                    reform taking place only as education moved beyond such classical subjects as Greek and Latin for
                    the upper classes to practical knowledge that would transform the lives and social position of
                    common workmen and their families. In the early nineteenth century William Maclure became one of the
                    most ardent advocates of the modern teaching methods of Swiss educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi.
                    He sponsored schools based on Pestalozzi's system in <placeName>
                  <country reg="sp">Spain</country>,
                            <country reg="fr">France</country>
               </placeName>, and America. In the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> area he supported the earliest Pestalozzian teachers and schools in this country.
                    Joseph Neef, William S. Phiquepal, and Marie Duclos Fretageot each directed a separate school before
                    1825.</p>
            <p>Maclure then enticed them and other Pestalozzian educators to join him in Robert Owen's utopian
                    experiment in character formation at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. It was the biggest gamble of his life. By combining his educational,
                    scientific, and financial resources with Owen's socialistic communal effort to begin the New Moral
                    World at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he hoped to realize his dream of raising the standard of living of the working poor in
                    the Industrial Age.</p>
            <p>He convinced several of the most important members of the American Philosophical Society and the
                    Academy of Natural Sciences of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> (of which he was president) to take up residence in Owen's utopia on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. A few, including naturalists Charles-Alexandre Lesueur and Thomas Say, made the icy
                    trip down the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> in 1825 on Maclure's now-famous "Boatload of
                    Knowledge."</p>
            <p>The Owenite experiment in community-building at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> lasted only two years. During that brief time, however, Maclure and his Pestalozzian
                    teachers placed <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s schools in the vanguard of education in America. They operated an Infant School for
                    children as young as two, replicating Owen's program at New Lanark, and conducted classes in the
                    Pestalozzian style for those six to fourteen. They introduced Maclure's concept of vocational
                    training in the School of Industry, one of the two earliest such institutions in America. In the
                    school boys learned printing and other trades, publishing noteworthy volumes of the research of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> and other scientists on their own press. Maclure brought <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> scientists and master tradesmen into the classroom and into a program of lectures for
                    adults. Long after the abandonment of Owenite communalism in 1827 and the departure of its feuding
                    partners—Owen in 1827, Maclure in 1828—<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> remained a monument to Maclure as a center for Scientific research and publication. For
                    decades the village bore Maclure's geological stamp. It became a base for the state and federal
                    geological surveys led by David Dale Owen that opened the Midwest for industrial development.</p>
            <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-094-2-009"/>
            <p>In addition, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> gave Maclure the opportunity to begin his own experiment in educating the general
                    public by means of libraries for workingmen. The Workingmen's Institute in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for which William Maclure donated the initial funding in 1838, continues today as the
                    oldest functioning library in the state of Indiana. Yet this single library does not define the
                    extent of Maclure's contribution to education in the Midwest. After he died in Mexico on March 23,
                    1840, his will provided $500 gifts that eventually went to 144 workingmen's libraries in
                    Indiana and 16 libraries in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Regardless of these achievements, the details of Maclure's life and the significance of his work have
                    only recently been effectively excavated from the bedrock of European and American history.
                    Maclure's place as a pioneer of geologic exploration was scarcely acknowledged before 1925 when
                    Charles Keyes published his article "William Maclure: Father of Modern
                        Geology."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The magnitude of Maclure's European geological
                    explorations and some of his ideas came to light when John Doskey edited <hi rend="i">The European
                        Journals of William Maclure</hi> in 1988. Additional insights into Maclure's private life and

                    readers another step closer to discovering the real Maclure. They originated as papers presented in
                    special sessions devoted to an assessment of Maclure's contributions to science, education, and
                    social reform. These sessions were held in <placeName>

                    undertaking in the fall of that year, saw themselves standing at a critical juncture in history.
                    They believed that the age in which they lived and the reforms they undertook were fraught with
                    significance for humanity's future. Temperamentally, the two men were a study in contrast. Maclure,
                    far more cautious and skeptical, lacked Owen's charismatic personality and penchant for oratory. Yet
                    in a quieter and more subdued way, Maclure was a visionary too. Like Owen, he believed absolutely in
                    the coming of a better world and in his ability to help fashion it.</p>
            <p>Maclure's redoubtable optimism led him to see opportunities to rebuild society everywhere, even in

                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> and anarchic Mexico. But it was America that drew forth his and Owen's highest hopes.
                    "A new era is commenced on your side of the Atlantic," Maclure wrote to his

                    extensive hori-son. The sun will follow, and the diffusion of Knowledge will be as unbounded as his
                    light." Both he and Owen, Maclure wrote a year later, considered "the field of

                    "purest and most rational Society," hence the ideal place to implement plans for
                    social improvement.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Americans themselves could not have agreed more. Since the founding of the colonial settlements,
                    America had been a place to start over, to erect a new and perfected society. The Revolution
                    powerfully reinforced Americans' sense of standing on the leading edge of progress. In <hi rend="i">Common Sense</hi>, the pamphlet that galvanized the movement toward independence in 1776,
                    Thomas Paine announced, "We have it in our power to begin the world over again….

            <p>In the mid-1820s American self-confidence soared to new heights. Like Owen and Maclure, citizens saw
                    themselves and their country as marking a new epoch in history. In America alone, they believed,
                    humanity had thrown off the chains of oppression and tyranny. While royalty and aristocracy still
                    ruled Europe and its colonial possessions, in America most people lived not as subjects but as
                    citizens—enlightened, prosperous, and free. As Maclure and Owen began their work at <placeName>

            <p>"The spirit of improvement is abroad upon the earth," President John Quincy Adams
                    declared in December, 1825. Americans believed their unique combination of political freedom and
                    material abundance would enable them to lead the world in the march of what Adams called
                    "moral, political, intellectual improvement."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Wealth,

                    American optimism melded national pride and civic boosterism with Enlightenment faith in the power
                    of reason and the unity of truth. Patriot scientists such as Benjamin Silliman of Yale and <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s Thomas Say hoped their discoveries would vindicate a democratic people's claim to
                    intellectual distinction. Every town promoter shared William Maclure's hope of making his community

            <p>Beginning in the 1820s, American belief in the malleability and perfectibility of human nature
                    powered a range of benevolent enterprises from "civilizing" the Indians to
                    reclaiming wayward individuals in asylums, orphanages, and prisons. Citizens placed great faith in
                    the possibilities of education. They believed they could transform the national character by raising
                    a generation of improved human beings. American prisons that aimed at rehabilitation instead of mere
                    punishment became a magnet for foreign visitors. Plans appeared for schools of all
                    sorts—free schools, manual labor schools, female academies. In education, as in every
                    other area, Americans intended to lead the world. They believed that every new step they took toward
                    human improvement would exalt both republican government in principle and the <placeName>

            <p>The Americans' belief in themselves as a people set apart for a special purpose thus ensured a
                    receptive hearing for the ideas of Robert Owen and William Maclure. In the heady atmosphere of 1825,
                    nearly anything seemed possible. Both grand and vague, Owen's call for a "new system of
                    society" matched Americans' own immoderate expectations for themselves.</p>
            <p>Proclaiming utopia, however, proved easier than building it. Owen's dream foundered quickly at <placeName>

                    his prematurely declared Community of Equality dissolved. Although Owen was unbowed by the disaster,

                    always doubted that communitarian schemes and charismatic leadership could instantly transform
                    society. Instead, he invested in education and science as slower but surer roads to the same end.</p>
            <p>Yet in their efforts to build schools and to spread knowledge among the citizenry, Maclure and his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> agent, Marie Duclos Fretageot, also encountered mounting frustration and
                    disappointment. Given the American enthusiasm for individual and social uplift, why did their
                    program founder? The answer is ironic, for the same democratic and optimistic milieu that nurtured
                    Maclure's and Fretageot's hopes also nourished the germs of their failure. Americans chorused
                    Maclure's faith in the perfectibility of their society, but it became increasingly clear that they
                    differed with him in their vision of what a perfected society should be.</p>
            <p>Maclure had always linked his scientific and educational pursuits to political ends. Along with his
                    faith in progress, he took from the Enlightenment a profoundly Manichean view of social evolution.
                    Maclure saw starkly opposing forces of light and darkness contending for control in Europe, in
                    Mexico, and even in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Some elements in his analysis—his attack on the commercial classes and his
                    championing of the common people as the real producers of wealth—seem to anticipate Man.
                    But neither his diagnosis of social ills nor his cure were solely economic. The real root of
                    injustice and distress, Maclure believed, was not the upper class's control of wealth or production,
                    but its monopoly of knowledge.</p>
            <p>As his friend Thomas Say observed, Maclure was "thoroughly convinced, by all his experience
                    that the inequality of knowledge is the source of all the evils that torment humanity." The
                    masthead of Maclure's <hi rend="i">Disseminator of Useful Knowledge</hi> at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> proclaimed that "Ignorance is the fruitful cause of Human Misery."
                    Educating the rich would only widen the gulf between the rulers and the ruled. But by the same
                    token, as Maclure told his friend Samuel George Morton, "raising the mass of industrious
                    producers by the diffusion of useful knowledge" would equalize both property and power, and
                    thus secure "freedom and happiness" for all mankind.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Naturally, the "aristocracy" (a favorite epithet of Maclure and his friends) would
                    not willingly relinquish their hold on either knowledge or power. "Ignorance,"
                    Maclure observed, "is the food, clothing, and only support of every description of
                    priest." It maintained and fortified "the priveledges, imunities, and
                    consideration of all men in power, and 9/10 of the rich and influential in all countries."
                    By keeping the masses ignorant, the aristocracy kept them down. Its chief instruments of control
                    were the coercive force of the state and the doctrinal <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>But in America the chains had been broken, first by the Revolution that overthrew the principle of
                    aristocratic rule and later by the democratic upheaval that spread suffrage to the people and in
                    1828 made Andrew Jackson president. Maclure shared much in outlook and rhetoric with the
                    Jacksonians; and though he was never politically active himself, he and his associates Thomas Say,
                    Marie Duclos Fretageot, Robert Dale Owen, and Frances Wright all identified with Jackson and his
                    Democratic party. Jackson too assailed the "aristocracy" at every turn, and his
                    clashes with the Congregational-Presbyterian phalanx of benevolent and charitable organizations
                    mirrored the New Harmonists' hostility to clerical authority.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, as Maclure never fully grasped, "aristocracy" is in the eye of the beholder.
                    In his schemes of social uplift Maclure repeatedly found himself frustrated by what he termed
                    "the obstinacy of schoolmasters the ignorance of parents, and the intolerant bigotry of
                        priestcraft."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Maclure's earnest devotion to the welfare of the
                    working people blinded him to his own dogmatism. Wishing only to educate the laboring masses to
                    their true interest, he never doubted that he knew what was best for them himself.</p>
            <p>Both Maclure and Owen assumed that with political liberty secured, Americans' most pressing
                    need—the prerequisite to any further advance in their status, knowledge, and
                    power—was to sever themselves from religion and its web of superstition and terror. Their
                    Enlightenment view of history taught Maclure and Owen that the Church and its minions had always
                    fought social and intellectual progress. Hence both men branded organized Christianity as their
                    worst enemy. In his famous "Declaration of Mental Independence" at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> on July 4, 1826, Owen denounced "ABSURD AND IRRATIONAL SYSTEMS OF
                    RELIGION" as one of the three greatest evils besetting the human race.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While Owen railed publicly, Maclure sought to replace religious indoctrination with "useful
                    knowledge," disseminated through scientific publications for adults and practical schooling
                    for children. <list type="footnotes">

                    practical application of technical knowledge would later gain wide acceptance, Maclure's efforts
                    yielded little direct result. Maclure worked on a small scale and never learned how best to reach
                    the people he was trying to help. There is something inspiring and yet deeeply pathetic in his
                    attempt to get plain farmers and tradespeople to forsake their useless "poetry, history,
                    romance, law, &amp;&amp;tc." for his "real and usefull"
                    scientific and polemical works, and in his bafflement when his offerings did not sell.</p>
            <p>Similarly, Maclure never comprehended the tenacious resistance of parents to his schemes for
                    educating their children. He came finally to believe he could never succeed with pupils from the
                    "independent classes," who had ideas and interests of their own. In place of these
                    "defective materials," he sought "orphans who have no parents to depend
                    on, or to spoil them," and with whom he could play a free hand. Here, too, Maclure's
                    sincerity of purpose blinded him to the implicit authoritarianism of his own position.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short, like any reformer, Maclure had to contend with peoples' reluctance to be reformed.
                    Everywhere they tried their hands, even in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Maclure and his associates met indifference and even hostility from the ordinary
                    people they were trying to help. For this, Maclure's system of social analysis offered no ready
                    explanation. How could the people not want what was best for them? Only stubbornness or stupidity
                    could explain their rebuff of his offer to elevate their condition and set their minds free.</p>
            <p>As Maclure perceived, the real root of his difficulty lay in religion. When Marie Duclos Fretageot in
                    1825 remarked "the evils which surround my pupils" in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>

                    "impious rhodomontade" full of "poisonous doctrines" and
                    "nefarious disclosures." "How any woman of piety and good feeling can

                    "nothingism" there brought notoriety abroad and turmoil within. Long after Owen's
                    community collapsed, its reputation for infidelity lingered, poisoning Maclure's efforts to recruit
                    students and to spread his doctrines, and even souring his own family relations. Maclure knew his

                    falsehoods" spread by self-interested "priests and sectarians." He
                    expected no less from the clerical aristocracy.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>But in America there was no clerical aristocracy. Maclure's fundamental error was to mistake the

                    </placeName>, the Awakening also rode the tide of national optimism and faith in progress. Its
                    preachers did not challenge democracy or reason; instead, they embraced both. But they defined human
                    improvement and America's providential mission in explicitly Christian terms; the utopia they sought
                    was the reign of Christ on earth. Preachers like the Presbyterian Lyman Beecher labored in
                    "full belief that the millennium was coming, that it was at hand, that the Church was just
                    about to march with waving banners to final and universal dominion." Using techniques of
                    suasion rather than repression, Christian evangelists strove for free and voluntary conversions, not
                    slavish obedience. Aiming to make the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName> asked those who believed in Christianity to stand up. An audience of twelve hundred
                    rose as one. In the printed version of the debate, it was Owen who appeared didactic and
                    doctrinaire, while <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>

            </p>
            <p>It was Owen's and Maclure's misfortune to launch their experiments against the greatest torrent of
                    religious enthusiasm the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> had ever seen. Locked in his dualistic view of the world, Maclure could never see the
                    revival for what it was: a profoundly popular movement propelled by impulses and hopes that were as
                    progressive and stirring as his own. The great gainers in the Awakening were not old established
                    hierarchies crying damnation and despair, but upstart denominations—Baptists, Methodists,
                    Christians, Disciples, and a dozen others—that spurned authority and tradition to appeal
                    directly to the people. Like Maclure, they, too, preached popular empowerment and liberation, but
                    empowerment and liberation attained through a Christian faith and directed to Christian ends.
                    Shedding or sidestepping the forbidding doctrines of Calvinism, they married Americans' prevailing
                    confidence in progress and improvement to a creed that stressed the hope of individual salvation and
                    the ability of committed Christians to create a better world.</p>

            <p>The scope and strength of this Christian upheaval baffled and frustrated Maclure and his friends.
                    They believed that destiny favored them. They expected to lead Americans toward a rational future,
                    purged of religious cant and superstition. Instead, without understanding what had happened, they
                    found themselves cast aside as the parade of history took a different route.</p>

                    </placeName>, which Maclure had long served as benefactor and president, his friend Samuel Morton
                    observed that "what Religion itself has not been able to accomplish, Philosophy will
                    attempt in vain." Maclure's philosophy was his faith in reason, a faith so simple and
                    artless that it amounted to a religion of rationality. But from the time of the revival that
                    surrounded and engulfed Owen's and Maclure's reform efforts in the 1820s and 1830s, their
                    Enlightenment cult of reason beat a steady retreat under the renewed onslaught of evangelical
                    Christianity. Although some of Maclure's educational and scientific ideas endured, the philosophy
                    that inspired them—a philosophy not only irreligious but explicitly
                    anti-religious—was overpowered and in time nearly forgotten. A century and a half have
                    passed since Maclure and his fellows scanned the horizon for the dawning of their new day. Yet
                    philosophy has not displaced religion.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>And what of that vision, shared by Owen and Maclure and their Christian adversaries as well, of
                    America as a New Moral World? Although muted and bruised, in some sense it still lives. But as early
                    as the 1830s, events began to undermine American hopes of an imminent millennium. The dissolution of <placeName>

               </placeName>; the Panic and depression of 1837, which destroyed hopes
                    of limitless, seamless economic growth; the deepening impasse over slavery, as white southerners
                    entrenched themselves behind a wall of proslavery repression; the emergence of political parties,
                    implanting the principle of divisiveness instead of harmony at the heart of American politics; the
                    perversion (at least in some eyes) of the country's moral mission in the world into an unseemly
                    thirst for territorial acquisitions—all of these developments served to stifle, if not to
                    extinguish, Americans' expectations of breaking loose from history and erecting something new under
                    the sun. Americans would not stop dreaming and striving for a better world. But never again would

            <p>Maclure's first visit to <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> lasted four months. During the trip he met other people in the country besides
                    innkeepers, friars, and gypsies. In his travels Maclure always tried to make contact with the
                    institutions of culture and the important men associated with those institutions. At the physics
                    laboratory in Barcelona's Academy of Natural Sciences and Arts he met Francisco Carbonell y Bravo,
                    the author of a number of books on chemistry and pharmacy and founder of the new School of Chemistry
                    in 1805. In Valencia Maclure was in touch with the Economic Society of the Friends of the Country
                    but was not able to meet Juan Sanchez Cisneros, a scientist, military man, mineralogist, and an
                    indefatigable traveler and publicist. Later Maclure did get to know Cisneros after he carried a
                    letter of introduction from Pestalozzi during his 1820 trip. In Alicante Maclure visited the famous
                    prince pio, a grandee of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> and an archaeologist, historian, and philologist who would die soon after in November,
                    1808. At Granada, too, Maclure stopped at the Economic Society of the Friends of the Country and the
                    Academy of Design and Mathematics, a typical center of the Spanish <hi rend="i">Illustracion.</hi>

            <p>Maclure then visited the cotton plantation of William Kirkpatrick at Churriana and the sugarcane
                    plantation of Henry Grevignee near Malaga. At the time Kirkpatrick was the American consul in Malaga
                    and was married to a daughter of Grevignee, who already had a partly Spanish name, Francisca
                    Grevignee y Gallegos. Kirkpatrick, who was related to Eugenia de Montijo, the future empress of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, was a man of great initiative. With Grevignee and a third partner he founded in 1810 a
                    textile factory in Malaga at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>. But in 1811 Malaga was occupied by the French, and Kirkpatrick made the error of being
                    their strong partisan. This marked the end of his enterprise, but he was still in Granada in 1821,
                    dedicated to the mining industry.</p>
            <p>These people formed the nucleus of Maclure's relationships in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> during his first trip. Later in his 1820 visit these relationships deepened. At that
                    time <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> had launched a liberal revolution, which experimented with a constitutional form of
                    government that lasted until 1823, when <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> was defeated by a military invasion of French absolutists and the Holy Alliance. The
                    next year, 1824, Maclure left <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>, attended "by the folly, stupidity and cruelty of despotism."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> His properties were confiscated in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>. Maclure's Spanish visit came between two French invasions. As a man who hated all
                    despotism, Maclure came to hate the French style of despotism in particular.</p>
            <p>In 1820 Maclure stayed out of Spanish politics, but he leaned toward the liberal
                    parties—to the Cortes and to the Spanish people in general. The Spanish Revolution ended
                    in failure, but the years between 1820 and 1824 were the culmination of a political transformation
                    that had begun with the end of the Ancient Regime and the Napoleonic invasion of 1808. The Spanish
                    Revolution was unlike the French Revolution, which was a concentrated series of events (the French
                    speak of "évènement fondateur"). The Spanish Revolution
                    moved slowly with sudden flashes that extended through two centuries. The so-called
                    "Trienio liberal" was one of the most important of those fulgurations. Despite the
                    revolution's ultimate disaster, those years prepared <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> for a transition to a new order in legislation, in the popular mentality, and even in
                    the habits of the population.</p>
            <p>Maclure believed that the Spanish climate, both physical and political, would allow him to initiate a
                    great new experiment near Alicante. His failure was the failure of the Spanish political situation,
                    the failure of <placeName>

                        Harmony</settlement>
               </placeName> would be the new land of social experimentation. What Maclure's
                    Spanish career, his enterprises, journal accounts, and Spanish friendships did accomplish was to
                    provide important means for understanding that beleaguered country.</p>
            <p>Maclure arrived in Madrid in November, 1820, for his second visit and remained in the capital until
                    1822. He was primarily an observer <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>'s political developments, though soon he planned once again to build another kind of
                    world. Maclure's intention was not to descend into politics but to lay down the foundations of a new
                    society. Only then would he become involved in a new kind of political behavior. Most revealing of
                    Maclure's thoughts and actions in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> is his correspondence with two Pestalozzian teachers, Marie Duclos Fretageot and
                    William S. Phiquepal. With Maclure's assistance both teachers were in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> working in a school for boys. Maclure's relationship with Fretageot was not only
                    professional, it was personal as well. Maclure also had a friendship with the American diplomat
                    George William Erving (1769–1850), who was formerly <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> representative in Madrid (1804–1809 and 1814–1819). To a certain
                    extent Erving was a radical like Maclure, but his affairs in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> were based largely on a zealous and ill-conceived interest in buying royal deeds and
                    bonds of the Spanish national debt, which tended to move perennially downward.</p>
            <p>Almost all of Maclure's relationships during this time were related to <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and constituted a strong tie between the two countries. Fretageot and Phiquepal arrived
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> with Maclure on the keelboat <hi rend="i">Philanthropist</hi>, which plied the
                        <geogName>Wabash River</geogName> in 1825 to inaugurate the social experiments of the
                    Owenite-Maclurian period. Phiquepal later returned to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> and in 1831 married Frances Wright, the famous author of <hi rend="i">Views of Society

            <p>In 1820 Maclure went to <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> for both health reasons and political considerations. He found <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> attractive because it offered a climate salutary for his rheumatism and because out of
                    the political situation a constitutional government had emerged. Maclure liked this form of
                    government. He found the Spanish people in a terrible condition of ignorance, but he hoped that the
                    constitutional regime would help them with education and democracy. He followed the country's
                    political evolution daily, standing with the people against the government, which was officially
                    liberal. In those years Maclure spoke repeatedly of the terrible ignorance of the Spanish masses,
                    but he believed in the force of education and came to admire the great qualities of the Spanish
                    people—their energy and firmness along with their restraint and respect for order.</p>
            <p>Maclure's thoughts on Spanish society are clear. He observed: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Spaniards are as ignorant as any other people, but they have acquired a faith in the value of
                            their own effort after a long and anarchic apprenticeship. For Spaniards, anarchy occupies
                            the place of reason, and it eggs them on to defend their rights without a perfect
                            understanding either of the principles on which they are based or the effects derived from
                            them. In this way anarchy is an advantage. Another advantage is that the ruling classes in <placeName>
                                <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                            </placeName> are almost as ignorant as the masses, and because of this are unable to take
                            advantage of their economic superiority. There should always be a balance between knowledge,
                            property, and power, but in <placeName>
                                <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                            </placeName> the wealthy classes have no knowledge, only indolence and imbecility, which
                            nullifies their achievements <pb n="104" id="VAA4025-094-2-026"/> and makes the illusion
                            that property is more properly distributed. So if <placeName>

                  </p>
                    </quote> The Spanish constitution may have been centuries ahead of the country's civilization, but
                    for Maclure the problem was the effect of the "obstinate habits of pride" and
                    presumption that drove "the lower classes to defend their freedom, that is to say, their
                        anarchy."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first thing Maclure tried to do in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> was to introduce a printing press and two technicians who would publish the dispatches
                    of the Spanish state department under a contract with the government. It is curious to find Maclure
                    attempting to publish a documentary collection in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>. He was not, after all, a historian. Indeed, he adhered to the idea that history was a
                    tale where the adventures of villains are told. Yet, in his view, history also opened the eyes of
                    the simple people. Resolved to print the dispatches, Maclure tried to import from <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> a new printing press, which demonstrated his faith in technological progress. Despite
                    several references to the printing press, it is unclear whether or not it finally arrived in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Maclure was interested in translating Joseph Neef's book, <hi rend="i">Sketch of a Plan and Method of
                        Education</hi> (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1808) into French and Spanish. He thought two thousand copies for <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> and Spanish America would be enough. Even in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> Maclure thought not only of the European country but of Spanish America as well. He
                    also wanted to publish some of his political essays written in 1819 in Spanish for the <hi rend="i">Revue Encyclopddique</hi>, but they would not appear because of French censorship. The essays
                    were eventually published in Spanish and appeared later again in English in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Gazette.</hi> Finally they appeared in Maclure's book, <hi rend="i">Opinions on Various
                        Subjects</hi> (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1831). The size of those essays increased from the French translation into Spanish and
                    again into English. The Spanish edition, unfortunately, is full of problems. The essays were
                    published in Madrid, but nothing else is know about them. Perhaps saying <hi rend="i">published</hi>
                    is saying too much, for nobody has seen a single copy. Maclure translated and printed the essays,
                    but it is not certain that he gave them out for distribution. He thought that their themes were too
                    advanced for the Spanish mentality, so he made a leaflet out of his work. He first sent three
                    hundred copies to Fretageot and later another one hundred fifty. It seems he ordered a special
                    publication of only twenty-two pages, and it also seems that they appeared in a newspaper.</p>
            <p>Scholars are on firmer ground in studying Maclure's mining interests in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>. Although he approached his mine visits and his collection of minerals scientifically,
                    his intentions were also idealistic. <list type="footnotes">

                    potential basis of a future industrial revolution. He was also a financial partner in a silk factory
                    in Valencia, which he spoke of in 1833 and noted in his last will of 1840.</p>
            <p>Between 1820 and 1822 Maclure's relationships were varied. One association that he built was with
                    Rafael de Rodas from Aranjuez, his representative in the region surrounding the Tagus River. Rodas
                    owned a soap factory and was a man of ideas prepared to sell his production in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>

                    </placeName>. In 1824 he was a member of the Junta de Fomento del Reino, which was a kind of board
                    established to improve the material conditions of the country. In 1838 he became director of the
                    Savings Bank of Madrid.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>Fortunately more information exists on Jacobo Parga y Puga, former minister of the Supreme Council of
                    the Treasury, provisionally appointed minister of the Interior of the Peninsula in March, 1820, and
                    in Maclure's own words, "the only scientific gentleman in Madrid."<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Professor Antonio Meijide Pardo of La Coruna has dedicated a book to Parga y Puga,
                    which follows his studies at Santiago University, his problems with the Inquisition in 1795, his
                    beginnings in the civil service, and his scientific and economic significance at the Museum of
                    Natural Sciences in 1815 and the Credito Publico in 1816. As a naturalist he was known by his work
                    in the museum and for his mineralogical collection. Finally, he was a member of the Cortes in 1834
                    and was a senator in 1845.</p>
            <p>In July, 1822, Maclure was in Madrid, where he witnessed the counterrevolutionary movement, and his
                    descriptions of the movement in letters to Professor Benjamin Silliman of Yale College and to
                    Fretageot are of great interest. After the counterrevolution Maclure went to Alicante, where he
                    arrived on November 21, 1822. The trip was motivated by his taking possession of the lands bought
                    from the Credito Publico in the states of San Gines, El Carmen, and La Guzmana. There are several
                    descriptions of those properties, which were formerly owned by the church.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
                    Maclure, glad about the possibilities the states offered to him, sought an agreement with the
                    governor of Alicante for a Lancastrian school. He pledged to pay half the salary of a teacher. He
                    also wanted to build a new school, an agrarian institute, which he promoted as beneficial not only

                    ones.</p>
            <p>The Lancastrian school, located at first in the city because it would be cheaper, would be based on
                    this improved agriculture, but it would soon be joined by a Pestalozzian school in the countryside.
                    As Maclure explained in his <hi rend="i">Opinions</hi>, the Pestalozzian methods could be
                    incorporated into a Lancastrian framework. Both schools were to form the nucleus of a new kind of
                    society. He persuaded the Alicante orphanage to place sixty orphans under his care, just as in 1829
                    he announced that he would take Mexican children to the industrial school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In the Alicante region the idea was to combine an industrial school with experiments
                    in agriculture and with Pestalozzian methods of education.</p>
            <p>There were great problems on the horizon not only because <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> was approaching a civil war but also because of technical questions. Yet Maclure
                    remained confident. He believed in the future of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>, and he hoped that the political struggles would not interfere with his plans. Even in
                    financial questions, Maclure was confident, at least publicly. His article "Spanish
                    Bonds" in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>

                    <hi rend="i">Morning Chronicle</hi>, November 23, 1822, was an attempt to placate and disarm
                    international public opinion on the question of Peninsular finances. Privately, his doubts were
                    greater, but Maclure wanted to help the country overcome its difficulties. The thought Maclure gave
                    to his school is understandable when the number and quality of the would-be professors of the future
                    school are considered. He planned to bring M. Conti, who taught gymnastics in <placeName>

                    </placeName>; Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, the famous French naturalist who later taught in <placeName>

                    </placeName>; M. James, a disciple of Phiquepal in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who would take care of the instruction of the orphans; one of the four Combe brothers
                    who were Scottish Owenites in the frontier of British Saint-Simonians; and one of their uncles,
                    known because he was the keeper of one of the best cafes and taverns in Edinburgh. M. Puriles, who
                    knew both Spanish and the Lancastrian methods of education, would be in charge of the Alicante
                    school. Phiquepal himself would be in charge of the agrarian Pestalozzian school in the country.
                    Maclure also began negotiations with an excellent mechanic—unfortunately he does not
                    indicate his name—who was to join his enterprise. He intended to create one of the
                    so-called "moral manufactories" believed to be useful for the exceptional
                    conditions of intelligence and natural skill of the Spanish children.</p>

                    Pestalozzian school in the country, separate but connected with the industrial and agrarian
                    institute, where mechanics and drawing would be taught. One name must be mentioned immediately as a
                    model for Maclure's concept, the Swiss pedagogue and Pestalozzian, Philipp Emmanuel von Fellenberg,
                    to whom Maclure devoted an article collected in his <hi rend="i">Opinions.</hi> For Fellenberg, as
                    for Maclure, the school, which marked the beginning of a wider social community, was to cover its
                    own expenses. Fellenberg and Maclure differed, however, in their aims. Fellenberg wanted to preserve
                    class distinctions, reasoning that since there would always be rich and poor, both should be
                    educated in mutual respect.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Maclure was probably more radical in his aims.</p>
            <p>The agrarian-industrial school was the last of Maclure's projects in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>. Unfortunately it collapsed because of the French invasion of <placeName>

                    $40,000 (he himself spoke once of $60,000), a tremendous loss that he accepted
                    stoicly. Worst of all was the loss of hope. But <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> emerged in 1825 as the continuation of the experience, the new promised land where the
                    Spanish idea would be fulfilled far removed from French bayonets and Spanish despots.</p>
            <p>Besides Rodas and Parga, the collaborators of Maclure in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> between 1820 and 1824 were indicative of the variety of his interests. First came the
                    bankers. In a time when the modern concept of a bank was in its incipient stages—it was
                    born after and derived from the Napoleonic wars—for Maclure, the banker was still a
                    friend and administrator of his money and private correspondence. Maclure operated with Henry OShea
                    of Valencia, a well-known name in the development of banking in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> during the nineteenth century, an Irish name that is still heard in Spanish banking
                    circles. Also, he dealt with Henry McCall of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gi">Gibraltar</country>
                    </placeName>. But Maclure preferred another firm—Wiseman, Gower and Company, a kind of
                    old-fashioned bank belonging to an Anglo-or Irish-Spanish family. To the same family belonged the
                    future Cardinal Wiseman, born in Seville in 1802. There are other names: George Barrell, American
                    consul in Malaga, as well as several commercial agents such as Casas y Costa; Manuel Basterrica of
                    Irun; Juan Bautista Iribarren and nephews, Balmaseda and Nelson; and Santiago Aramburu in Madrid.</p>

                    Solitario" (the lonely one) and was perhaps the first to write in the Romantic tradition.</p>
            <p>Another associate of Maclure's in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> was the French doctor, later turned American citizen, Jean Leymerie. The attitude of
                    Maclure and his circle toward him was one of friendship but not of total approval. In 1821 Leymerie
                    was an exponent of the anticontagion-ist theory concerning the question of the Barcelona epidemic
                    that divided medical doctors into two factions—contagionist and anti-contagionist.
                    Although basically a medical question, it immediately acquired a political meaning and a kind of
                    urgency. The French government sent to Barcelona a medical mission whose members were all
                    contagionists. It is difficult to doubt the professional honesty of those doctors, but their
                    position served the French government. They intended to install a sanitary corridor behind which
                    they would concentrate an army of the invasion. Today Maclure's association with the impulsive and
                    imprudent Leymerie probably means that he was interested in health questions in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> of those years.</p>
            <p>The Spanish seed grew fully in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The famous program "Knowledge is Power" was applied by Maclure in
                    the New World. His ideas can be traced back to the Age of Reason, to Montesquieu, French Jacobinism,
                    and English Radicalism, as well as to Adam Smith, John Grey, David Ricardo, Constantin Francois
                    Volney, and various followers of forms of utopian socialism such as Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier,
                    and Robert Owen himself. But Maclure was not a man who experienced ideas only through reading. He
                    was a geologist, a man of science, and also a traveler. What he saw in his travels went directly to
                    the formation of his thought. In this way the Spanish experience of William Maclure was crucial. He
                    was a man on the edge of two worlds, not only geographically but also ideologically. He was a
                    progressive radical who distilled the best of the revolutionary struggle in Europe and America
                    between the eighteenth and nineteenth <pb n="109" id="VAA4025-094-2-031"/> centuries. And he was
                    also a utopian socialist because he sought a new social order based on kinds of social relationships
                    different from those that were dominant at this time. Utopian socialism, as the Argentinian
                    historian Claudio Ingerflom has observed, was not only abstract and speculative, it also developed a
                    critique of contemporary society that took historical factors into account.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was remarkable progress. What Maclure learned in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> put his thoughts in order. The ideas were abstractions derived not from abstraction but
                    from daily experience. And in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> the liberal revolution was for him an open book. Ideas were not separated from
                    politics: the man of science and the thinker belonged to the same world as the worker, peasant, the
                    soldier, or the city dweller. In a word, the people. Maclure wanted to save himself by saving the
                    people. This last word is perhaps utopian, but all movements of human liberation need a political
                    framework that serves as a constitution. It is interesting to note that one of Maclure's essays, <hi rend="i">The Incompatibility of the Two Powers, Hereditary and Elective, to Exist Peaceably in
                        the Same Body Politic</hi>, already translated into Spanish in 1822, contains praise of the
                    Spanish constitution of 1812 as he saw it during the liberal Triennium.</p>
            <p>In summary, Maclure became part of a <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> in full transformation. His failure was the failure of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>. Yet out of this calamity his personality acquired a deeper dimension. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> would become the appropriate theater for displaying all his potentialities.</p>

                    science: Maclure to the natural sciences of geology and mineralogy, Owen to the social sciences of
                    character formation and community building. Together, these two men led the exodus of several of the

                    farther west than any college in the country produced far-reaching scientific, cultural, social, and

                    into the world as ignorant as a pig of anything useful." And he asserted that "I
                    had been long in the habit of considering education one of the greatest abuses our species were
                    guilty of, and of course one of the reforms the most beneficial to humanity."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Maclure's radical social philosophy divided populations into nonproductive and
                    productive classes, the governors and the governed. He argued that knowledge held exclusively by the
                    governing class accounted for the concentration of power and property in the hands of the few.
                    Likewise, knowledge made available to the masses would become the engine for their liberation and
                    the equalization of power and property. Therefore, Maclure sought to open young minds through local
                    schools available to the general public.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While developing these ideas, Maclure discovered the progressive institute of Johann Heinrich
                    Pestalozzi (1746–1827) at Yverdon, <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, in 1805. Pestalozzi believed in learning by doing, learning tailored to individual
                    maturation levels, learning by concrete experiences. Maclure visited Pestalozzi's school at least
                    six times. He was so taken by the new methods that he financed such a school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, bringing the skilled Pestalozzian teacher Joseph Neef from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> for this purpose. Pestalozzian education in this country can be dated to Neef s
                    instruction and the publication in 1808 of his <hi rend="i">Sketch of a Plan and Method of
                        Education.</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">5</hi> On his way down the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> on the
                    "Boatload of Knowledge" in January, 1826, Maclure stopped at Joseph Neef s home
                    near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to invite him to join the Pestalozzian faculty going to <placeName>

                    </placeName>. On March 20, the famous teacher and his equally gifted wife, Eloisa Buss Neef, arrived
                    to take positions of leadership at the infant and higher schools of the experimental village.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meantime, Maclure established himself as the "father of American geology"
                    and became influential in scientific circles. The geological map of the <placeName>

                    represented a breakthrough in the field. Published the same year, it made his reputation and laid

                    chemist, Dr. Gerard Troost, a man whose position Maclure filled from 1817 until his death in 1840.
                    In 1816 Maclure brought the noted naturalist, artist, and teacher Charles-Alexandre Lesueur
                    (1778–1846), to be curator of the academy. The two met in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Maclure convinced Lesueur to accompany him on a geological expedition through the West

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> before Lesueur began the curatorial duties that would occupy him for seven years at the
                    academy. In an age of generalists Lesueur would distinguish himself in the fields of paleontology,
                    archaeology, ichthyology, and zoology.</p>
            <p>Maclure also formed a lifelong friendship with the academy's librarian, the brilliant if shy and

                    was to discover and implement means to create a New Moral World. This would be a world of
                    enlightenment and prosperity leading to human happiness, which Owen defined as mental, physical, and
                    moral health enjoyed in a rational way of life. It would displace the Old Immoral World of
                    ignorance, superstition, selfishness, and suffering intensified by the first wave of the Industrial

            <p>Educators and scientists were crucial to Owen's plan because education, science, technology, and
                    communal living were the methods he chose to achieve the New Moral World. Underpinning his utopian
                    theory was the proposition that individual character is an automatic consequence of the quality of
                    physical, social, and intellectual surroundings. By 1813 he asserted that "any general
                    character, from the best to the worst, from the most ignorant to the most enlightened, may be given
                    to any community, even to the world at large, by the application of proper means; which means are to
                    a great extent at the command and under the control of those who have influence in the affairs of
                        men."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> He came to feel that it was possible to discover the laws

            <p>Owen's trip to America in November, 1824, was intended to do just that. He used his fame as a

                    and communal dimensions of Owenism. She also played a crucial role in convincing her patron William
                    Maclure to combine his resources and scientific and educational enterprises with those of his fellow
                    philanthropist. When she came from <placeName>

                    lent the account to the young medical doctor, William Price, whose father was superintendent of the
                    Friend's Boarding School at West-Town. Dr. Price was so enamored with Owen's teaching philosophy
                    that he visited his experimental schools in New Lanark, <placeName>

            <p>The academy's John Speakman, at one time in the pharmaceutical business with Thomas Say, was so
                    inspired by Fretageot's Owenite propaganda that he headed an unsuccessful project to establish a
                    "community of equality" in 1823–1824. After meeting with Owen on his
                    visits to the academy after November, 1824, he saw that Owen's addresses in the Hall of the <placeName>

                    took his hands," she confessed by letter to Maclure who was in Europe, "saying;
                    there is the man I desired so much to converse with! And you are, said he, the woman that I wish to
                    see. We are old acquaintances and in the mean time he gave me a kiss of friendship that I returned

                    show what are the effects of a good education." "He observed," wrote
                    Fretageot, "that I would devote 30 years of my life where I now am without being able to

            <p>Robert Owen himself gave the "Boatload of Knowledge" its historic name. On January

                    </placeName> and was making his first speech to its citizens. He boldly proclaimed that those about

            <p>Among the forty passengers were two other notables. Robert Dale Owen (1801–1877) at age
                    twenty-four was already showing signs of the abilities that would make him an important figure in
                    American politics and reform.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> He had completed a Pestalozzian-type education

                    "Boatload's" voyage.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Stedman Whitwell was an English
                    architect and social reformer. Robert Owen had commissioned him to construct and bring to America a
                    six-foot-square architectural model of the ideal million-square foot Agricultural and Manufacturing
                    Villages of Unity and Mutual Co-operation he proposed be built worldwide. Owen and Whitwell had

            <p>The <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> and its primeval shores held surprises and delights for the
                    unsuspecting urbanites aboard the eighty-five-by fourteen-foot keelboat with its six long oars,
                    sternsweep, and gouger.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> The keelboat itself was an unwelcome substitute for
                    the steamboat on which Maclure and Owen intended to escort their sophisticated friends to <placeName>

                    to outfit the alternate craft that Maclure purchased. Each of the keelboat's four compartments,
                    front for crew, second for men, third for women, and rear for children, were given tiered bunks,
                    crude chairs and tables, and potbellied stoves. With "everything in considerable
                    confusion," Maclure and Owen escorted their learned party aboard these humble quarters at 2

            <p>During the first several days the women aboard protested the hardships. Robert Dale Owen, who himself
                    adapted well to the primitive conditions of outdoor life and welcomed such circumstances as a
                    fitting preparation for all who were bound for backwoods <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, noted the feminine discontent. In sections of his journal written in the relative
                    secrecy of German rather than his usual English, he observed that "Some of the ladies of
                    our party appear already quite impatient and dissatisfied the more so since they almost cannot do
                    anything for themselves." Soon "they complained publicly about their unhappy
                    lot," and one young lady, Sarah Turner, actually wept at breakfast. At one time Robert Dale
                    "feared they might turn back and that would be a pity."<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
                    However, the ladies later actually enjoyed the outdoor environment, especially frolicking on the
                    ice-covered <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. And some even helped row.</p>
            <p>But things got worse before they got better. The "Boatload of Knowledge" drifted
                    seven miles the first day and nine the second before running aground "either on account of
                    a strong sidewind or of the awkwardness of our pilot."<hi rend="sup">38</hi> The
                    intervening evening had given Robert Dale his first chance to see the interior of log cabins, which
                    he found "pretty comfortable." Say and Price had accompanied him to an island in
                    search of milk, which they found in "good supply." Although title to property on
                    the island was in doubt, in one cabin the men "found a negro family, jovial merry people,
                    with whom we had a deal of fun." Being aground on Merriman's riffle, a narrow rapid, was
                    not fun, however. It was a hazard from which they could not free themselves. At least the keelboat
                    crew, and possibly some of the male passengers, could not loosen the boat even by getting into the
                    freezing water several times, one man suffering stomach cramps for his trouble. Fortunately, the
                    ever neighborly Harmonists were building their new village of Economy (now Ambridge) on the <placeName>

                    The elder Owen had purchased their Indiana town and visited them at Economy just a year before. Now,
                    with Maclure, Phiquepal, and Lesueur, he left the keelboat to seek Father Rapp's assistance. After
                    sunset the six strong Harmonist men whom Rapp dispatched freed the boat in an hour of hard labor.</p>

            <p>Robert Dale Owen described the rescuers as knowing "admirably how to act in concert, to be
                    steady, retired, cautious and industrious, but not to possess superior intelligence or liberality of
                        sentiment."<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Although prejudicial, his assessment did suggest
                    Harmonist qualities that were critical to the strong communal organization of their Harmony Society.
                    As the Boatloaders visited their "very flourishing" new town of Economy the next
                    day, they witnessed the fruits of such commitment. And even though they were not aware of it yet,
                    the Harmonist qualities were significantly reversed among many who would settle as unscreened
                    citizens in Owenite <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This factor alone would help explain why the Owen-Maclure community would never enjoy
                    the unanimity of purpose or the economic success of those of the Harmonists.</p>
            <p>The Owen-Maclure entourage was entertained in grand style by George Rapp, his adopted son and expert
                    business manager, Frederick, and his gracious and musically talented granddaughter, Gertrude. They
                    drank tasty, aged wine made from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>

                    Charles-Alexandre Lesueur and Thomas Say must have felt as the group beheld the Harmonist deer park,
                    a fenced area containing deer and two elk, one of the earliest zoos in the country. Animals from
                    this pen and many other specimens that the Harmony Society had been collecting and preserving were
                    put on display in their large Feast Hall in 1826. Much of this collection for which the Harmonists
                    charged admission can still be viewed. It is thought to be the nation's oldest natural history
                    museum housed in its original building.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

                    Knowledge" and participation in its most exciting adventures. These occurred mostly from
                    December 11, 1825, to January 9, 1826, twenty-eight days during which the keelboat was stuck in the
                    ice at Safe Harbor station only fifteen miles below Economy and eight miles above Beaver, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. Safe Harbor must have seemed a misnomer to the marooned party. The fht full day there
                    two of Phiquepal's boys fell through the ice in the middle of the river. Nobody was near enough to
                    help them, but they could swim and got out on their own. Later, Dr. Price "fell into the
                    river through the ice up to his neck, but got out without other inconvenience than a good
                        wetting."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> Worse was the accident that befell Phiquepal, who had
                    gone hunting with Lesueur. The teacher fell getting over a fence and hit his head on a log. He lay

                    often was disagreeable, some might say Phiquepal never fully recovered, but he was well enough to
                    travel when the thaw finally came. Before that, a few had abandoned ship. Mrs. Fisher left on
                    December 16 with a man who had arrived from Yellow Springs, <placeName>

                    spending December 23 to 31 in Beaver. After a brief return, these two left the keelboat again on
                    January 5 and headed for Steubenville, <placeName>

            <p>Others enjoyed their wintery sanctuary at Safe Harbor. For Lesueur there were endless opportunities
                    for sketching not only specimens, but also people, including the family in the cabin where he was
                    caring for the injured Phiquepal. Robert Dale Owen was awed by the untouched beauty. "The
                    appearance of the woods is wild and magnificent in the extreme," he wrote,
                    "immense trees lying across one another, and everything, apparently, in a perfect state of

                    Whenever you pass by their doors you are asked to walk in and welcomed with unfeigned
                        pleasure."<hi rend="sup">44</hi> One such local settler, John Rice, taught him the
                    finer points of riflery and caring for his firearm. He also had him shoot at targets, but with
                    little improvement of his aim. When he and John walked through the deep snow to a shooting match six
                    miles from the keelboat, John won a turkey and a pair of braces, Robert Dale only a handkerchief.
                    Maybe that is why he felt that "the persons present seemed to me in low spirits, without

            <p>Recreation aboard the icebound "Boatload of Knowledge" took the forms of games of

                    writings read aloud by Fretageot in their original French and silently by Robert Dale Owen. Both
                    women and men entered the discussions on topics ranging from costumes to Fourierism, the young Owen
                    sharing the Frenchman's basic principles but hding his methods impractical. Robert Dale's

            <p>On Christmas Day, with hopes for a thaw dashed when the promising rain stopped in the early
                    afternoon, Thomas Say and Robert Dale Owen spent most of the uncelebrated holiday talking with
                    Phiquepal. First they discussed the meaning of words. Then they explored the types of articles that
                    they should plan for the <placeName>

                    their perfect composure in cases of danger or of sudden alarm or of extreme pain, the tenacity with
                    which they nourish revenge etc." This induced Robert Dale to muse, "I believe the
                    evils of the savage and of the civilized state are nearly balanced—They have many
                    excellent qualities, which we most irrationally neglect to cultivate, but they fail to attain much
                    of which we are in possession."<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

                    with Macdonald in a friendly debate about workers and production. The young philosopher stated his

                            productions. We must be careful, too, not to forget that happiness is the object of our

            <p>Lesueur sketched the momentous event on January 8, as passengers and crew labored together to cut a

                    channel. Pushing off the next day, they began the tranquil remainder of their trip, almost
                    uneventful by comparison. Rowing with the long oars became routine for the men, and sometimes the
                    women took a turn. They were in Steubenville by 5 p.m. Here it became apparent that the prospect for

                    rescued after falling into the river while dipping a mug for water. A few lighthearted passengers
                    sang and danced on the deck of the keelboat until late one night. On January 15, Robert Dale Owen
                    recorded a temperature of twenty-two degrees Fahrenheit. Stedman Whitwell may have given him this

                    possibly habitable inside. He contended that an opening near the North Pole permits the moon to
                    force air into and out of the interior. The dark complexion of the Eskimos was due, he said, to the
                    hot air being expelled from the earth. Symmes, who died in 1829, was trying to secure funds from
                    learned societies to mount an expedition to test his hypotheses.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> "His
                    theory appears plausible, and the great collection of facts whch he brings to bear upon it evinces
                    his industry and I think considerable talent and penetration," wrote Robert Dale Owen after
                    hearing the lecture. In a more generous mood with Symmes than with the Methodist clergyman, he
                    added, "The matter appears to me worthy of investigation, as the subject of an

            <p>Robert Owen put William Maclure in charge of the educational program that was to reform human
                    character and lead to utopia. When Maclure was away, Fretageot and Thomas Say were in charge. There
                    would be an Infant School, a Higher School, a School of Industry, and adult learning through
                    lectures, libraries, and museums. The Infant School was created to duplicate Owen's New Lanark
                    school for children ages two to five. Therefore, <placeName>

                    mechanics. Robert Owen's son Richard arrived in 1828 and studied art privately with
                    Charles-Alexandre Lesueur. He wrote that Lesueur "was a magnificent artist, good alike in
                    drawing and coloring… when I was taking lessons from him, he showed me how to outline,
                    for instance, the skeleton of the human figure, then to add the muscular system, then the clothing,

                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s industrial school implemented Maclure's philosophy that every child should learn at
                    least one useful trade. More than eighty students from the Higher School, mostly boys, spent part of
                    each day learning an occupational skill as in modern "co-op" programs. Maclure
                    intended that the sale of products from the school should relieve the community from the expense of
                    educating its own boys and girls and should aid students who came from as far distant as <placeName>

                    fees. William Phiquepal taught printing. Boatloader John Beal taught carpentry along with skilled
                    craftsmen in various trades. The boys learned shoemaking, hatmaking, joining, taxidermy,
                    wheelwrighting, woodturning, blacksmithing, and agriculture, while the girls trained in cooking,
                    sewing, housekeeping, dressmaking, and millinery as taught by the talented ladies of the town. But
                    drawing, engraving, and printing became paramount in the curriculum. This was because of Maclure's
                    conviction that the ideal educational system should link teaching to research and publication.

                    the geologist became America's first benefactor of libraries when public education was minimal and
                    the public library concept was in its infancy. The nation would wait for the twentieth century to

            <p>No ill-fated communitarian venture has been examined or analyzed more than Robert Owen's attempt to

                    </placeName> calls to mind Walt Whitman's "Vivas to those who have fail'd!" For
                    more than a century and a half, historians, antiquarians, and not a few latter-day utopians have
                    conducted countless postmortem inquiries into Owen's short lived venture on the banks of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. Many shortcomings in Owen's scheme and strategy are familiar. The insightful
                    observations of Arthur Bestor, fleshed out further by many fellow historians, identify a host of
                    crippling managerial miscues committed by Owen. As Bestor convincingly noted, "Each of
                    Owen's personal mistakes had been sufficient in itself to wreck the experiment." Which
                    mistake was the most serious? In response to this question Bestor posed a pointed rhetorical query
                    of his own: "In a firing squad, if all the guns are loaded, which man performs the
                        execution?"<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In sharp contrast to his serious managerial difficulties, however, Owen has also been credited with
                    some flashes of brilliance. By most accounts, no flash outshone his success in persuading William
                    Maclure to join forces with him at <placeName>

                    triumph in America."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Bestor's claim makes eminent sense from the
                    perspective of western educational history. Indeed, when seen from this angle of vision, the
                    Owen-Maclure alliance merits lasting triumphal acknowledgement. But when considered from the
                    perspective of Owen's immediate communitarian plans, it was nothing less than a disastrous marriage.
                    The alliance may have been Owen's most grievous miscalculation.</p>

            <p>What brought these two reformers together? What made them think they could work profitably as a team?
                    Several apparent similarities could have formed the basis of mutual attraction. Here were two men,
                    each brilliant in his own right, each dedicated to the ideals of social cooperation, meliorism, and
                    education.</p>
            <p>Robert Owen, for example, had formulated a generally consistent theory of ideal community life that
                    rested upon the plinth of education. Since 1800, when Owen became the manager of the cotton
                    mills—and village life—of New Lanark, <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>, he had gained an international reputation as an educational and social reformer. Owen
                    had in fact become a social reformer because of the "logic of his educational
                        doctrine."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Upon the strength of his plan for the schooling of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> children he rested his hopes for the long range success of his Indiana experiment. He
                    came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> strong in the faith that he could so control "external circumstances"
                    as to shape every child according to certain general specifications for cooperative enterprise in an
                    ideal community. Owen came believing his program of education could be wielded "with the
                    certainty of a law of nature."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> And he also came believing that William
                    Maclure and he shared compatible social and educational doctrines.</p>
            <p>Owen was greatly impressed with Maclure's brilliant reputation. Since retiring at the turn of the
                    century from lucrative years in business and settling in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Maclure had won wide acclaim as a leading scientist, philanthropist, and patron of
                    social reform through Pestalozzian education.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Maclure was more than an eminent
                    pioneering geologist, the first president of the American Geological Society, and president of the
                    Academy of Natural Sciences. He was also an astute student of Johann Pestalozzi's educational
                    theories and practices, a builder of an experimental schoolcentered community in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>, and a patron of such Pestalozzian teachers as Joseph Neef and Marie Duclos Fretageot.
                    And Owen rightly knew Maclure to be first and foremost an educational reformer.</p>
            <p>But it required admirable powers of persuasion for Owen to convince Maclure to join in the utopian
                    venture at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for Maclure still nursed wounds from an ill-fated venture of his own. In 1820, eager
                    to test his own ideas of social reform through education, Maclure had put aside his scientific and
                    educational activities <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> gave him little opportunity to test his ideas. In the midst of national insurrections,
                    marauding guerrilla bands, monotonous uncertainty about the durability of the Cortes, and local
                    threats to reestablish the terrors of the Inquisition, Maclure's educational venture sputtered
                    fitfully, and in 1824, after nearly four years of uphill struggles, it ended abruptly with the
                    confiscation of Maclure's property.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Maclure found refuge in America, his
                    adopted land. There, as he licked his wounds, he grew wary. But he kept a firm grip on his ideals
                    and remained a staunch advocate of educational reform.</p>
            <p>It was in the capacity of educational reformer that Owen particularly wanted Maclure. Owen sensed
                    correctly that through their partnership Maclure's connections in the international community of
                    scholars would attract a distinguished faculty to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Out of their discussions grew a proposal to divide the communitarian labors. Owen
                    would manage the general community; Maclure would supervise the educational program. Maclure seemed
                    relieved at the prospect of fixing his energies exclusively on educational matters. This was not to
                    be a return to Old World <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>. Not only did Maclure draw "courage" from Owen's successes
                    "against a powerfull [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] combination of both church and
                    state," he also fervently believed "the field of moral experiment in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to be the finest in the Globe."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Maclure's opposition
                    softened and he agreed to forge an alliance. He further delighted Owen by agreeing to invest money
                    of his own in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> venture and to accept responsibility for the proposed scholarly and educational
                    programs. In 1825, with one disastrous investment of time, energy, and money barely behind him,
                    Maclure found himself organizing a new educational crusade.</p>
            <p>From the outset, Maclure's prestige and infectious enthusiasm attracted famous scientists to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>—Thomas Say, Gerard Troost, and Charles-Alexandre Lesueur among them. He also
                    enlisted such Pestalozzian specialists as Joseph Neef, Marie Duclos Fretageot, and Phiquepal
                    d'Arusmont, and ordered a "vast collection" of books and scientific instruments to

                    </placeName> Owen quickly became unhap py with the pedagogical practices of Maclure and his
                    colleagues. He launched a determined attempt to gain control of the educational enterprise that
                    rightfully regarded Maclure as its director. Owen's preferred pedagogical principles failed to win
                    the support of Maclure, Neef, and, as it developed, of his own sons. Bitter debates ensued with
                    disastrous abandon over several central pedagogical issues that neither disputant had fully
                    anticipated when they joined forces.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1825 Owen handed Maclure the educational reins in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, believing that he and Maclure were in essential agreement on pedagogical matters. Both
                    accepted the argument that a thoroughgoing social reconstruction depended upon an enlightened
                    pedagogy. They shared a belief in the power of environment. For both men all human traits were, and
                    must always be, necessary results of conditions in the physical world. But while both partners
                    pursued the same general objectives, they approached them from vastly different directions. Owen
                    framed his objective as a rigid syllogism in support of welfare corporatism. If human character is
                    everywhere imposed upon the individual by external forces, and if society is the creator of those
                    forces, then society bears full responsibility for the conduct and attitudes of its members. And the
                    demands of society dictate the general character to be stamped on each of its members. <list type="footnotes">

                    education became the "most important" vehicle, for social reconstruction.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Owen wanted to establish at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> an exemplary school of communal education to showcase his "new view"
                    of community life in the New World. In America he sought to replace the Jeffersonian suspicion of a
                    strong central government with his own utilitarian credo: that government is best which defines and
                    provides the greatest happiness for the greater number. Happiness grew out of effective relations
                    between the paternal leader and a cooperative, productive populace.</p>
            <p>Ever the entrepreneur, Owen believed that the successful industrialist knew best how to provide the
                    greatest happiness in the social setting. While praising the ideas of "mental
                    independence" and individual rights, Owen maintained that the needs of community were
                    paramount. When individual and community inevitably collided, Owen's community emerged unscathed;
                    the individual invariably found the limits of "mental independence" and individual
                    rights determined by community interests. As historians Jacob Bronowski and Bruce Mazlich observe,
                    Owen substituted "his Captains of Industry for Plato's Philosopher Kings; he was saying
                    that the organizational skills necessary for entrepreneurship in industry are also those needed in
                    undertakings for the reconstruction of society."<hi rend="sup">12</hi> The enlightened
                    "Captain of Industry" was one who looked after the psychological, social, and
                    physical needs of his workers. One might legitimately call Owen a seminal philosopher of
                    corporatism, an early advocate of the "organized man" in the corporate community.
                    Since the 1820s, those with ideas similar to Owen's have striven to pull the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> toward "a plurality of welfare communities, i.e., the corporations, rather
                    than a single national welfare state…."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Certainly those
                    who looked hopefully to communitarianism as the solution to the social and economic problems of the
                    Gilded Age often agreed that reform could succeed best under the aegis of leaders "who have
                    at least as much ability and intelligence as is required, for instance, in the succed management of
                    a railroad or a bank or large manufactory."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Owen represented management ideals; he wanted <placeName>

                    important to Owen than its individual members; the cooperative character acquired by the community's
                    children more important than the creative intelligence endowed to each. <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="144" id="VAA4025-094-2-066"/> Owen's view of human nature reinforced this preference. He
                    believed original human nature to be good. Each human being, he declared, is "a delightful
                    compound, containing the germs of unalloyed excellence" that requires but a
                    "kindly soil and careful cultivation" to develop sound character.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Owen beheld still other important innate dispositions: each child possessed a congenital love of
                    truth and a remarkably strong faculty of altruism. Despite his talk of self-interest, he believed
                    one of the "original faculties" of human nature was "the desire to
                    benefit our fellow creatures to the greatest possible extent."<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Apart
                    from this dramatic qualification, Owen seemed intellectually sympathetic toward Lockean and
                    Helvetian learning theories and at first praised the work of Johann Pestalozzi and Emmanuel
                    Fellenberg. Operationally, however, he proved too impatient to plant belief in the child's heart to
                    be in league with these noted educators. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> he abandoned Pestalozzi in favor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the monitorial model of instruction—a model based on an image of the
                    child as a passive being who quietly received and accepted on faith the significance of the
                    knowledge given to him.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Certainly, passive and uniform group experiences could
                    be controlled better than active and spontaneous experiences in learning.</p>
            <p>Owen wanted a high degree of uniformity imposed on each child's nature, while Maclure wanted each
                    child raised in an atmosphere of spontaneity and choice. Owen rebuked Maclure for encouraging <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> teachers in practices that thwarted Owen's desire to implant "similar
                    habits" within each child. He tried in vain to convince Maclure to form "one
                    well-digested arrangement" of education. But instead of keeping children together in one
                    group while teachers took turns giving instruction, each of Maclure's teachers followed a
                    semi-Rousseauian plan, taking a select number of children under exclusive tutelage for the entire
                    course of their formal education. Maclure thus brought what Owen called "divisive"
                    influences into the school. Owen was here thwarted in his "most earnest desire, that <hi rend="i">all</hi> the children should be educated in similar habits and <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> children to a peculiar and unexpected antagonism to the boarding school program that
                    Maclure preferred and initiated. By common consent among the avant garde of the early nineteenth
                    century, boarding schools were at the cutting edge of "enlightened" education.
                    They were widely held as vastly superior to day schools if one desired to mold children to fit some
                    ideal type. American academies were frequently boarding schools. Philips Andover, Philips Exeter,

                    </placeName> Female Seminary had followed this principle. Pestalozzi and Fellenberg, two of the most
                    respected "modern" educators of the era, ran internationally famous boarding
                    schools. Indeed, Owen himself had sent his four sons—Robert Dale, William, Richard, and
                    David Dale—to board with Fellenberg. How could Owen have been surprised or dismayed at
                    Maclure's preference for the boarding school? Did he forget that Maclure had been master of his own

                    inconsistent position. On the one hand, Owen wanted all children to be educated in similar habits
                    and dispositions, but on the other hand, he wanted them returned to their own homes every evening
                    where they would "be under the eye and inspection of their parents."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Owen here trampled on one of Maclure's central requirements for sound education.
                    Maclure built for utopia gradually, through education. Owen hoped to be recognized as the Benevolent
                    Leader as he had been at New Lanark and thereby transform a tumultuous multitude into instant
                    utopians, Owen was optimistic about his ability to transplant new values in older minds. Maclure was
                    skeptical about reshaping adults' values.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

            <p>In an age when institutions were more flexible and transitory, Maclure, like Pestalozzi, saw
                    education as the only way to bring both individual and institutional improvements.
                    Perfection—of individual and group—could come only by providing an enlightened
                    education for children. Such had been the argument presented by Pestalozzi himself in his book <hi rend="i">Leonard and Gertude</hi> (1781). Cast as a social essay in the fictionalized manner of
                    Rousseau's <hi rend="i">Emile, Leonard and Gertrude</hi> had provided an excellent example of how
                    the powers of education could lead to the spiritual and moral uplift of the imaginary village of
                    Bonnal. The town leaders of Bonnal came alive to the possibilities of far-reaching reform through
                    proper—meaning Pestalozzian—education; and the residents rallied behind their
                    school.</p>
            <p>Together "they regarded the proper education of the youthful population as the only means of
                    elevating the condition of the corrupt village."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Their patience and
                    steadfastness produced wondrous results. The village prospered. The moral tone and sense of social
                    responsibility among the villagers rose to the point that the public gallows could be torn down and
                    a new hospital erected. Temperance became a way of life. Education brought to Bonnal the spirit of
                    intelligent social brotherhood. Soon other villages were following the example set by Bonnal.
                    Educational reformation and social uplift were on the march. <hi rend="i">Leonard and Gertrude</hi>
                    represented a process of improvements that Maclure could applaud.</p>
            <p>Joseph Neef could also smile upon Pestalozzi's slow-but-sure approach to perfection. Neef supported
                    Maclure's gradualism and accused the impatient Owen of trying to prepare youth for life in a
                    "feudal barony" rather than in an enlightened community.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
                    Maclure, too, wrapped Owen in dreary Old World imagery. He called Owen a
                    "Bonaparte" who sought to bring monarchy to America with his
                    "superfkial" knowledge of proper education.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Uniformity in
                    subject, method, and procedure destroyed for Maclure all that was central in learning.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> He sought instead to bring the power of reason to the child, <list type="footnotes">

                    development of character as a by-product of creative inquiry.</p>
            <p>Owen must by this time have realized that Maclure was an unorthodox communitarian, since Maclure
                    believed radical reformism was only a young and unsteady movement in an atmosphere of widespread
                    ignorance. He viewed <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a potential utopia, but its full promise was in the distant future. The mission of
                    his school therefore was simply to teach "the rising generation to <hi rend="i">think</hi>
                    by a useful and practical education." Owen's dreams of perfect community, chided Maclure,
                    dricted into his mind from a world still "some ages" away.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
                    Experimentation, respect for facts, and avoidance of opinion brought intelligence to Maclure's
                    students. But Owen was impatient for consensus to reign in the community. Maclure sternly decried
                    Owen's conformist goals. Here was a man, Maclure noted, who, lacking even "the smallest
                    idea of a good education," preferred to fill young heads with little more than precepts and
                    abstractions. Maclure was aghast at Owen's "parrot method of sticking incomprehensibles
                    into the memory of Children as you would do pins into a pincushion…." The
                    correct antidote to Owen's pedagogy was "the Pestalozzian System as taught by Mr.
                        Neef."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short, Maclure argued, it was essential to reject Owen's insistence that dogma be laid down in the
                    classroom. Dogma was repugnant to those who shared Maclure's views of learning.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Outraged by Owen, Joseph Neef fumed, "A rational man is a man who consults
                    experience and acts in conformity with the results of his experience; whose actions are invariably
                    based on his knowledge and not on his belief." Students should be trained "to
                    gather knowledge by their own senses, to consult experience in every instance, to analyze, to
                    examine, to investigate everything, to believe nothing."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Maclure and his like-minded colleagues argued for rational encounters, inquisitive and even skeptical
                    behavior, suspended judgments, an experimental attitude, and for a future world where honest and
                    reasonable persons might disagree without rancor, redesign their collective purposes, and embrace a
                    process based on experimentation. In Owen's eyes, Maclure's plan for a village full of mentally

                     <hi rend="sup">28</hi> Not all the faculty stood behind Maclure. Marie Duclos Fretageot
                            was critical of the scientific researches of Maclure's associates such as Thomas Say, Gerard
                            Troost, and Charles Alexandre Lesueur. She branded their inquiries and attitudes toward
                            learning as amounting to "hurtful" knowledge that "carries the
                            mind astray, in fact it is false knowledge," and dismayed Maclure by defending
                            Owen's pedagogical views. Given either her professional posture or considering the shaky
                            state of <placeName>

                    commitment, loyalty—these were the character traits Owen treasured! He rejected a
                    pedagogy that cast confusion in the form of skeptical reasoning before the student. Owen wanted <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> children to grow in loyalty to community dictates. In return he promised to guide their
                    shared purposes and satisfy their collective needs. If youth entered adulthood less able to rely on
                    their own initiative, they would be better able to accept leadership and counsel.</p>
            <p>Owen and Maclure labored at an impossible task, one that involved creating two significantly
                    different good societies with shared raw materials. Maclure might have known this early; Owen later,
                    if never fully. Maclure militantly opposed every form of learning that did not permit doubting; he
                    held such pedagogy to be the instrument of tyranny over the human mind. He firmly believed that the
                    good society awaited a universal education in enlightened self-interest and rational skepticism.
                    There were no shortcuts. He pressed uncompromisingly for critical inquiry as the method and aim of
                    learning. He beheld in the common people of both sexes the potential to exercise intelligent,
                    independent judgment on all matters. With knowledge "as taught by Mr. Neef" made
                    accessible to all, a moral life of equality of concern in all spheres of social enterprise would at
                    last open to the human family. In the interests of that moral life to come and especially to teach
                    young people how to face vexing problems forthright-ly and intelligently, Maclure urged the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> school faculty to compare critically the ends served by his and Owen's teaching methods
                    and purposes.</p>
            <p>Owen, meanwhile, kept calling for public "happiness" and pursuing it as if it were
                    an obligation incurred by successful entrepreneurship. Guided by his inner light and the power of
                    wealth, Owen celebrated corporate paternalism. The ideal school, it followed logically, should
                    induct the child into the way of life sanctioned by the community management. The school educated
                    for happiness by promoting perfected employee-employer relations in an ideal work-a-day world. Owen
                    was to be the liberal employer. He would provide work, supervise its progress and return profits to
                    the community, distribute the fruits of the corporate effort equally, care for the sick, and educate
                    the children to take assigned places in the community's quest for happiness. In return he asked for
                    gratitude expressed only in wholehearted cooperation.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

                    'with them,' they are bound to accomplish a large amount of harm. They are outside the influence of
                    that great faith which perennially springs up in the hearts of the people, and recreates the

            <p>Owen's communitarian views, when set against Maclure's, were more orthodox. Preachment and positive
                    reinforcement of communal beliefs had by then become common pedagogical devices in utopian plans.
                    Plato had imposed similar restrictions on teaching in his Republic; and Augustine had made a seminal
                    link between pagan and Christian planners by stressing the will more than reason and elevating
                    belief above understanding. Many religious communitarians had followed suit dutifully and logically.</p>

                    additional error to add to the list of Owen's miscues, more than one extra loaded gun to add to the
                    firing squad. Owen's union with Maclure might have been sufficiently suicidal to make one wonder
                    whether the firing squad had pumped its shots into a cadaver.</p>

            <p>Two independent centers of education were established simultaneously during the early part of the
                    nineteenth century by William Maclure in southern Indiana and by Amos Eaton in eastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. Geology was only one of many sciences thereby promoted locally. A commanding role,
                    however, was eventually played by these centers in shaping the intersection of public service and
                    applied or practical geology that survives today under the authority of state and federal agencies
                    responsible for geological exploration and survey work. Maclure was thirteen years senior to Eaton
                    in age. Although from different generations and from different family backgrounds, both were
                    attracted to geology as self-taught individuals. At best, these two geologists and educators shared
                    only the most attenuated connections, but they both operated under the guiding influence of larger
                    tendencies in American life to make science a public servant of humanity.</p>
            <p>In his massive 1924 compilation on <hi rend="i">The First One Hundred Years of American Geology</hi>,
                    George P. Merrill devotes the fmt two chapters to the "Maclurean Era,
                    1785–1819" and the "Eatonian Era, 1820–1829."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The exploits of these two hardy pioneers are intellectually as well as
                    physically monumental. Two of their achievements are particularly noteworthy. Maclure produced the
                    first geological map and texts in 1809 and 1817 summarizing much of the eastern half of North
                    America, an accomplishment derived from thousands of miles of personal exploration on foot. Eaton
                    produced a geographically more constrained but more detailed geological cross section and synthesis
                    in 1824 following the route of the Erie Canal across <placeName>

            <p>Neither of these men was a "closet geologist." That is, they were not content to
                    think about geology while seated indoors surrounded by books as did many of their contemporaries.

                    real, out-of-doors world of geology. Both men also were dedicated educators, and the year 1825
                    stands as a landmark in the history of geological education, owing to the independent schools in <placeName>

                    Geology was but one topic under consideration in their similar plans of education, but its practical
                    utility also fueled a profound change in the way the natural resources of the country were explored
                    and promoted under government aegis.</p>
            <p>The argument of this paper is threefold. First, that there is a direct link between William Maclure
                    and geologist protégé David Dale Owen, son of his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> partner Robert Owen. Second, that the aftermath of Maclure's educational presence in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> had profound effects on a rapidly emerging ethic of science and public service in
                    government on a state and national level. And third, that there is an instructional parallel for the
                    development of practical science in America between the careers of Maclure and his fellow geologist
                    and friend Amos Eaton, whose link with his own disciples spread out from his <placeName>

               </placeName>, during the same period.</p>
            <p>Although Merrill's <hi rend="i">First One Hundred Years of American Geology</hi> does not track the
                    educational legacy of these two pioneering geologists, the detailed record he assembled covers all
                    the geological survey projects undertaken in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> through most of the nineteenth century as well as the careers of the geologists who
                    performed them. The trail is easily followed by checking how the early generations of American
                    geologists acquired their education. In part, this story is covered by Markes E. Johnson in
                    "Geology in American Education," but further elaboration is provided here.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>How and why did William Maclure and Amos Eaton become enthusiastic converts to the geological
                    sciences, and what role did geology play in their educational programs? An extensive biography of
                    Eaton by Ethel M. McAllister with much documentation is available. Unfortunately, no comparable
                    biography on William Maclure exists. A short memorial by Samuel G. Morton (1844) was written not
                    long after Maclure's death. Most of what we know about Maclure must be extracted from his own
                    published record of beliefs or the voluminous correspondence and travel diaries he left behind. Some
                    of Maclure's letters on education are edited by Arthur Bestor, Jr. <list type="footnotes">

            <p>A Scottish immigrant to America with a talent for international trade, Maclure became independently
                    wealthy at a relatively early age. In an 1822 letter to Yale geologist Benjamin Silliman, he
                    explained what attracted him to geology: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>When I retired from commerce about twenty-five years ago, I looked round for some occupation
                            that might amuse me always, convinced that a man had the choice of his amusements as well as
                            of his profession, and that common sense dictated an amusement that would produce the
                            greatest good. I adopted rock-hunting as an amusement in place of deer or partridge hunting,
                            considering mineralogy and geology as the sciences most applicable to useful practical
                                purposes.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> It is this notion of geology as a useful and practical tool of science to be exploited for
                    the greatest good that most visibly characterizes Maclure's ethic of public service.</p>
            <p>A very similar outlook on the sciences, in general, was cultivated by Amos Eaton, Maclure's
                    contemporary. Although not of the same generation and not geographically close, Maclure and Eaton
                    most assuredly knew each other. The younger Eaton, in fact, showed considerable admiration for the
                    work of his elder. In 1830 he expressed the place Maclure had gained in his own mind and confirmed
                    the rank he would gain in the history of American science. He asked a mutual friend whose son was
                    then a student at his school in <placeName>

                    books, and he soon became a geologist. Granted a pardon late in 1815 at the age of thirty-nine,
                    Eaton went early the next year to Yale College to study geology and mineralogy under Benjamin
                    Silliman.</p>

                    the school's first courses in field geology, mineralogy, and botany. His skills as a teacher became
                    widely recognized. Following a year of what the college administration certainly viewed as the

                    Life"—words surely influenced by Eaton himself—is a very democratic
                    ideal, one clearly fostered by the free and exciting atmosphere of the young republic. It is this
                    atmosphere ripe with potential for growth and change that simultaneously affected William Maclure
                    and influenced his founding of a school in <placeName>

            <p>On December 8, 1825, William Maclure and a party of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana. The journey by keelboat down the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> was later
                    referred to as the "Boatload of Knowledge." Maclure's group was responsible for
                    the organization of a school system for Robert Owen's communitarian experiment in <placeName>

                    scientists including Gerard Troost, mineralogist and chemist; Thomas Say, zoologist; and
                    Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, naturalist artist. The aspirations of Maclure were as bold as those of
                    Eaton. One year later in 1826, Maclure wrote the following in an announcement to the <hi rend="i">American Journal of Science</hi>, "The schools here will be on such a <list type="footnotes">

                    zoology. A summer and winter term of fifteen weeks each led to a bachelor of natural science degree.

                    (1807–1860) was twenty years old when he came to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> for the remainder of his life.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> He expanded his knowledge of
                    geology working with Gerard Troost, one of Maclure's former associates, and then earned a medical

                    than three months late in 1839 by utilizing a task force of 139 field assistants. Twenty of these
                    assistants were recruited in <placeName>

                    public lectures using the town as his headquarters. He not only followed in Maclure's path as a
                    geologist dedicated to public service, but he also clearly considered himself a disciple. Owen
                    executed a faithful reproduction of Maclure's portrait, originally painted in 1797 by the English
                    painter Thomas James Northcote, and gave it a prominent place in his <placeName>

                    </placeName> home. More important, he also trained several other geologists who rose to successful
                    careers of their own as survey geologists.</p>

                    represented, only one was led by a contemporary of William Maclure. This was Gerard Troost, who
                    became the state geologist of <placeName>

            <p>Maclure was able to watch the unfolding career of David Dale Owen from afar in Mexico through letters

                        of Indiana, and perhaps he is as well if not better qualified for it than any other person in
                        the state. At present he is on a Geological Tour with Doctor Troost, who is Geologist Surveyor

                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Edward Hitchcock addressed the one-year old Association of American Geologists on the
                    subject of the phenomenal growth of state geological surveys throughout the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> movement, but he was one of those rare, self-taught individuals who arrived at the
                    crossroads of education and survey work as a professor of geology at Amherst College and the sole
                    agent of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> geological survey, which was founded in 1830. He observed that a total of nineteen
                    state funded surveys were initiated during the nineteen years from 1823–1841. The
                    astonishment over this unusual expansion of government science had not gone unreported to William
                    Maclure, again informed by Alexander Maclure in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Hitchcock proudly regarded the rush of the states to form active geological surveys as something
                    "peculiarly American." Indeed, the only other country to have previously
                    considered such a public program was <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, whose Ministry of Mining oversaw the division of that country into 214 districts for
                    potential geological mapping in 1766. There was never any clear agreement on how the maps should be
                    made or their information utilized, and the ambitious project floundered. The initial government
                    surveys in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> were strictly state sponsored, the first being undertaken in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName> from 1823–1827 and the second being undertaken in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> from 1824–1826.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> These projects were poorly funded,
                    however, and the results were marginal. The movement to fund adequately geological survey work from
                    tax revenues did not really begin until 1830 when Hitchcock's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> survey was initiated.</p>
            <p>In his 1841 address Hitchcock estimated that "our favorite science is now in this country 20
                    years in advance of what it would have been, if left to individual efforts." What was the
                    motivating spirit behind this historically unusual turn of events? The year 1825 is not only a
                    landmark year in terms of the educational experimentation undertaken by Amos Eaton and William
                    Maclure, but it is also notable for the remarks on the role of government in the promotion of
                    science made during President John Quincy Adams's first annual message to Congress. In part,
                    President Adams said,</p>

            <p>The strong spirit of public service exhibited by the rapid growth of the survey movement reflects
                    first and foremost the developing needs of commerce in a free and expanding society. These needs
                    benefitted from the strong moral example set independently in 1825 by William Maclure in <placeName>

                    A fainter echo reverberates from President John Quincy Adams's address before Congress in 1825, in
                    which he advocated a liberal policy of internal improvements based solidly on federal sponsorship of
                    the sciences.</p>
            <p>The most productive and continuous burst of geological survey work occurred through a period of
                    thirty-one years between 1830 and 1860. During that interval, fifty-six separate projects were
                    conducted in thirty-three states or territories. The <placeName>

                    idealism: learn by doing. David Dale Owen from <placeName>

                    </placeName> and James Hall from <placeName>

                    </placeName> were the most prominent geologists of this tradition.</p>
            <p>No other educational institutions come close to the record achieved by these two pioneering schools
                    during this particular period of time. Modeled on the example of the German research university as a

            <p>During the early nineteenth century when newly professional geologists were being attracted to survey
                    projects, only nine of the fifty-six projects (16 percent) were federally sponsored; four of the

                    to gain valuable field experience. Amos Eaton pioneered a style of field camp instruction still

                    School of Industry, employed a method of on-the-job training through his extensive enlistment of
                    survey assistants. A thorough science curriculum in American education was very rare when William
                    Maclure and Amos Eaton began their educational enterprises in 1825. As economic pressures made
                    government sponsorship of geological survey work feasible, a core of professional field geologists
                    was prepared to begin professional service to a nation eager to realize and utilize the full

                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> early in 1826 because he thought that Robert Owen's community would provide fertile
                    soil for his own Pestalozzian education programs.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> He soon found that Owen's
                    educational views did not agree with his own, and he made efforts to separate his programs. The
                    essential point of difference was that Owen thought adults could be reeducated to overcome the
                    biases of their upbringing, while Maclure believed that education started necessarily with children.
                    They also disagreed about methods, but that was of secondary importance.</p>
            <p>Aided by his Pestalozzian teachers, Joseph and Eloisa Neef, William S. Phiquepal, and Marie Duclos
                    Fretageot, Maclure established a school at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which most of the community children attended. Nevertheless, he did not abandon adults
                    as lost and beyond hope. His radical views, nurtured by the French Revolution, maintained that the
                    common people, "the industrious producers" as he invariably called them, could be
                    empowered by reading scientific works, much as Denis Diderot thought when he published his <hi rend="i">Encyclopedia.</hi> Maclure decided to use his money to make such works available at
                    cheap prices to the working poor. To that end he bought a printing press from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1827 soon after he came to <placeName>

                    </placeName>. He took a great interest not only in advances in printing technology but also in the
                    current ways of reproducing images, engraving and lithography, and he acquired presses for both of
                    these techniques. As early as November 9, 1824, while still in <placeName>

            <p>An interesting piece of arithmetic! Maclure returned to this theme again and again throughout his
                    life: to print more economically than the professionals. His estimates of cheapness varied
                    considerably. This one, "1/1000 part of their present prices," was the most wildly
                    optimistic, and of course it was never achieved. His idea of "distilling books," a
                    precursor of the <hi rend="i">Readers Digest Condensed Books</hi> series perhaps, was not carried
                    out either. His plan to use straw to make paper was also not accomplished, although an attempt was
                    made in Europe; the plan was impractical because the fibers did not hold together as well as they
                    did with linen rags. In the end, although he continued to talk about it for a long time, he never
                    owned a paper mill at all.</p>

                    how to work it properly, all went smoothly, and over the following years some remarkable works
                    emerged from it.</p>
            <p>One of the first practical uses of Maclure's printing press was the production of a local journal.
                    There was already a village newspaper, the <placeName>

                    Gazette concerned itself with local, national, and international news and only occasionally
                    published scientific papers by the resident scientists. From the full title of his journal, the <hi rend="i">Disseminator of Useful Knowledge; Containing Hints to the Youth of the <placeName>

                        </placeName>—From the "School of Industry</hi>," it is apparent
                    that Maclure had something different in mind. At its masthead the journal bore the motto,
                    "Ignorance is the fruitful cause of Human Misery." A prefatory statement in the
                    first number, signed by Maclure, declared, "These sheets will contain observations on the
                    possibility of improving practical education, by separating the useful from the ornamental, and
                    thereby reducing the labor and fatigue of instructing youth, and we will endeavour to prove that
                    children can educate, clothe and feed themselves by their own labor when judiciously applied to
                    articles of real value." The <hi rend="i">Disseminator</hi> first appeared on January 16,
                    1828, and continued until April 8, 1841. It did not live up to its avowed purpose, but over the
                    course of the years it published several of Thomas Say's scientific papers and many essays by
                    Maclure himself after he went to Mexico. After the removal of the <placeName>

                    the first major silva (a work describing the woody plants). Francois left America permanently in

                        when our country is all cultivated and may then only be known by their description. It is

            <p>Maclure's gloomy prognostication of the extinction of native trees of North America was completely
                    wrong although, from his own observation of the daily cutting down of trees for agriculture and
                    construction, the situation must have looked dark indeed. The fact is that not a single American
                    species of tree described by Michaux has suffered extinction, and all are still to be found in the
                    wild except for <hi rend="i">Franklinia</hi>, which Michaux himself never saw except in gardens.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">North American Sylva</hi> was a much more complicated and a larger and longer book
                    than the other works printed at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, but it was attractive as an early candidate for printing because the text was
                    complete, and the plates were all engraved and had only to be printed off. In a letter to Maclure,
                    who had now withdrawn to Mexico (he did not care much for the climate of southwestern Indiana),
                    Marie Duclos Fretageot, his agent, described the early preparations for printing the <hi rend="i">Sylva</hi> in a letter of January 2, 1829: <text>

                    with the Sylva and the Shells of Say and for that I shall be obliged to hire a printer because our
                    young people could not do the whole and also as it is of some difficulty it requires one that

            <p>While they managed to print the <hi rend="i">Conchology</hi> without outside help, it soon became
                    clear that the <hi rend="i">Sylva</hi> exceeded their skill, and it was not until the arrival of an
                    Englishman, William Amphlett, who joined the community in 1836, that the possibility of printing it
                    became a reality. Amphlett had to find suitable paper, a good pressman to work off the copperplates,
                    and someone more skilled than the scholars to color the finished illustrations. The small size of
                    the press, which had been adequate for Say's and Lesueur's works, presented difficulties, and a new
                    chase (the frame within which the types were arranged) was required. The progress of the printing of
                    the Sylva is described in the correspondence between Amphlett and Maclure during the years 1838 and
                    1839. On March 9, 1839, Amphlett wrote to Maclure:<text>

                    </placeName> where he had been president for life. Among these collections, it can be surmised, were
                    the copperplates of the <hi rend="i">Sylva.</hi> Even before the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> for an edition to be printed there. The authors have seen no correspondence that bears
                    on the eventual acquisition of the plates by the academy, but they must have rested in the academy
                    for a few years at least. Then they were lent or perhaps sold to a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> publisher, Robert P. Smith, so that he could bring out a new edition, which he did in
                    1850-1851. That edition was reissued six times in the course of which a new publisher, A. N. Hart,
                    took over. Then, with a colleague, D. Rice, Hart brought out a third American edition in 1857, which
                    was reissued three times, once under the imprint of Rice and Hart, once under Rice, Rutter and Co.,
                    and finally under William Rutter &amp; Co., in 1871, the last printing of this great work. None
                    of these several editions and issues could have been printed if Maclure had not brought the original
                    copperplates to America. What happened to the copperplates? Were they melted down for reuse as so
                    often happened, or are they resting still in some publisher's or printer's stockroom or perhaps on
                    some library's shelves, gathering dust, unrecognized for what they are?</p>
            <p>Not all the work of Maclure's press is about natural history of course. Maclure offered other
                    subjects as well. For example, he produced an edition of Aesop's <hi rend="i">Fables</hi> in 1832,

                    printed elsewhere. A major undertaking was Maclure's own <hi rend="i">Opinions on Various Subjects

                    work is an explicit statement of his radical social philosophy, a philosophy underlying his view
                    that knowledge is power. It was to help achieve this power that he set up his school, but when his
                    program eventually failed, he continued to provide the means of education through his printing
                    press. Ironically, not many of the works he published ended up in the hands of the
                    "industrious producers," but he certainly made a major contribution to natural
                    history in North America.</p>

            <p>According to the terms of his final will drawn up on January 29, 1839, William Maclure bequeathed the
                    bulk of his estate to the establishment of workingmen's libraries. Because of a lengthy lawsuit,
                    distribution of the money remained incomplete until 1857. What transpired during the seventeen years
                    following Maclure's death on March 23, 1840, is the subject of this discussion.</p>
            <p>In examining the acts that instigated the lawsuit, investigators find it clear that the persons who
                    precipitated these events were members of Maclure's family, people whom he disliked and mistrusted
                    with good reason.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> In a letter to Reuben Haines, Maclure stated that originally
                    his family had consisted of twelve children, six of whom reached adulthood. He said, "I am
                    the only one who has been able to do anything for themselves, so I have the care of a family without
                    the pleasure of getting them."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Maclure's understanding of his family's
                    dependency caused him to place his <placeName>

                    complained about Alexander, speaking of him as obstinate, prejudiced, and vain, and as an individual
                    who considered himself far superior to William and his associates.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once William arrived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1826, both Alexander and John joined him soon after. In 1828, following the
                    financial losses incurred by his participation in Robert Owen's communitarian experiment, Maclure
                    bade his two sisters who lived handsomely in <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName> to come to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> in order to decrease expenses.</p>
            <p>After William died in Mexico, Alexander lived comfortably, enjoying the company of like-minded
                    persons and disregarding the provisions of Maclure's will. He made several trips to the East,
                    particularly <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where the Academy of Natural Sciences made him a member.</p>
            <p>Like Alexander, Anna (1766-1844) disliked Maclure's philanthropic deeds, his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> activities, and especially his agent. To Anna and Alexander, Fretageot represented
                    their brother's unorthodox views and actions and the offense of his placing authority over his
                    financial affairs in the care of anyone but themselves. Anna and her friends acted against Fretageot
                    in devious ways, even conniving with the postmaster to mishandle her mail. Anna's financial
                    dependence on William did not prevent her from being very liberal to her own charities both at home
                    and abroad, thus creating a following among the religious inhabitants of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Margaret (1768–18391, who was younger than Anna and less emotionally and mentally stable,
                    did not get along well with her own family, and she intermittently found other people with whom to
                    board in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where she lived more tranquilly than she did under her sister's control.</p>
            <p>John (1771?-1834?), according to an account written by Alexander, also had a history of mental
                    instability caused by his imprisonment by the French during Robespierre's Reign of Terror. On his
                    arrival in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> he lived in and around <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but his behavior caused his elder brother much concern. He grew worse in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and when he became unmanageable, he was sent to an asylum in <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Thus life in the Maclure household was far from tranquil, with or without William's presence.
                    Alexander and William were unfriendly and cool; Anna and Margaret fought over Anna's insistence on
                    assuming the superior role; John's unsoundness of mind created turmoil. Since the four siblings were

                    hostility too openly.</p>
            <p>Obviously Maclure realized that he could not rely on his brothers and sisters to understand his
                    motives or have confidence that their presumed interest would make his ideas a reality. Therefore,
                    so long as Fretageot acted as his agent in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, she was a buffer between him and his family. Her 1831 departure and her death in
                    August, 1833, followed the next year by Thomas Say's demise, put Maclure at the mercy of his
                    relatives. Maclure's resulting alienation took its form in the terms of his will.</p>
            <p>Actually, Maclure made many wills at various times in his much-traveled life. They set forth his
                    philosophical interests and named those in whom he placed his trust. They expressed his thoughts and
                    desires, his self-acknowledged failures, and his continuing strong philanthropic sentiments toward
                    his fellowmen.</p>
            <p>Maclure's last will evolved through three stages. It was first written January 29, 1839. The
                    following September 23 he added a codicil; two months before his death (January 24, 1840) a second
                    codicil that introduced a sweeping change of administrators was inserted. This will brought on the
                    lawsuit that had to be waged and won before William Maclure's wishes for the workingmen's libraries
                    could be fulfilled.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A brief examination of the wills reveals at once Maclure's final intentions. The main bequest to his
                    family from the first writing was "the use and revenue of all my property real and personal
                    in and about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in the County of Posey and State of Indiana during their Life times… after
                    the decease of any one of them, or of the whole… the share that each shall leave in said
                    property, to be applied for the Diffusion of useful knowledge…."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> They were each granted annunities of $600 annually.</p>
            <p>In the first codicil (September 23, 1839) Maclure appointed Alexander and Anna as executors and
                    described specifically how the institutes for the diffusion of knowledge were to be organized: any
                    institute, club, or society of laborers who worked with their hands and that established anywhere in
                    the <placeName>

                    </placeName> a reading and lecture room with a library of at least 100 volumes was to be assisted by
                    a gift of $500.</p>
            <p>By January, 1840, Maclure had radically changed his mind and added a second codicil. In a final act
                    of disillusionment he dismissed all three of his trustees saying, "but on reconsidering the
                    melancholy state of morality which prevents dead men's wills from being fulfilled <list type="footnotes">

                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>

            <p>During the mid-and late 1830s Maclure had planned an educational trust under which the academy would
                    receive and administer his estate, the chief stipulation being that all books and collections would
                    be open to the general public. Despite Maclure's generous donations, which were given regularly, the
                    academy authorities chose to institute high entrance fees and annual dues. So Maclure rescinded his

                    "reals" in Spanish securities. He possessed an extensive library that contained

            <p>Because of the complex nature of Maclure's estate (and the vicissitudes it underwent in <placeName>

                    property, plus $30,000 for the library, and about $36,638 for the personal
                    property. This is the wealth from which money for the libraries would have to come.</p>
            <p>Following Fretageot's death in August, 1833, Maclure seemed to turn against the town where so much of
                    his effort and money had been dissipated. But by early spring of 1838 his interest revived. Despite
                    financial failures, disappointments, and personal losses, his optimistic temperament led him to try
                    again.</p>

            <p>In an April 20, 1838, letter Maclure explained to his sister Anna the reasons for the failure of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> schools. He told her that his only salvation for retrieving anything valuable from his
                    investments was to endow workingmen's institutes for the diffusion of knowledge, and specifically to
                    endow the <placeName>

                    </placeName> organization.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> There had already been a period of exchange of
                    correspondence between Maclure and the members of the Workingmen's Institute that had culminated in
                    its formal incorporation on April 2, 1838, as the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> Workingmen's Institute for Mutual Instruction.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> A few months later
                    he offered the group the use of his library and of one of his houses "as near the center of
                    town as may be…."<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In December the men replied that they were presently meeting in a room at the west end of the Hall
                    (the former Harmonist brick church that Maclure owned) with his permission, but they found it small,
                    inconvenient, and unsuited for a permanent home. By the following summer, however, they informed
                    Maclure that the organization was occupying a room above the stairs in the opposite or east wing of
                    the Hall. They quoted a passage from one of his earlier letters back to him, "I am
                    determined before I die to form as many of these clubs or institutes and endow them with the
                    necessary property that may enable them to go on and increase in utility."<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Unfortunately, by then the letters were either crossing, not arriving in Mexico, or not
                    being answered because Maclure's health deteriorated.</p>
            <p>Maclure's untimely death in 1840 left the institute's members without a guarantee of their own
                    quarters. They addressed Alexander Maclure as his brother's executor for permission to continue
                    using the east wing of the Hall and to be granted a lease or deed. Since Anna also was an executor,
                    the men likewise approached her. She wanted them to allow church services to be held in their
                    quarters. The minutes of November 14, 1841, record their terse reply, "Use of the lecture
                    room for preaching was refused."<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

                    attempting to acquire more. They consulted lawyers who cooperated in getting a judgment, claiming
                    that since there were no libraries yet in existence the money intended for them could not be
                    claimed.</p>
            <p>Both Maclures began leading a more opulent life. Accompanied by friends, Alexander made several trips
                    to the east, where he enjoyed a social success and was made a member of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> Academy of Natural Sciences. Anna continued to send charitable contributions to friends

                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName> and, relieved of Margaret's difficult presence in 1839, passed the last few years of
                    her life pleasantly.</p>
            <p>Determined to have a church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the two Maclures offered the Harmonist Grave Yard to St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in
                    April, 1842, as a church cemetery and possible church site. Since this site held deceased members of
                    the millennialist, communitarian Harmonists who settled the town in 1814 and held claim on the
                    property until 1845, the offer depended on the agreement of George Rapp and the Harmony Society.</p>
            <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-094-2-106"/>
            <p>When the Harmonists refused to relinquish their claim, Anna and Alexander persisted.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> By June, 1843, a deed was drawn by which the Maclures conveyed to St. Stephen's Vestry for
                    one dollar all the land and the Hall itself up to the wall dividing off the eastern wing (occupied
                    by the Workingmen's Institute according to William's orders), the Harmonist (German) Grave Yard, and
                    the strip of land used as the Rope Walk. This property was to serve as a church or school despite
                    the well-known fact that neither Owen nor Maclure would allow a church to be established in the
                        town.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this one action, to be repeated many times over, Alexander and Anna Maclure broke their brother's
                    will by selling the property. They disregarded the Harmony Society's claim to their graveyard, a
                    claim still valid for another two years. Their actions substantiated posthumously Maclure's distrust
                    of his own family.</p>
            <p>Misuse of these properties continued, and three years later an offer of $600 by the
                    Harmony Society in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> to purchase the Grave Yard "donated to the parish by Mr. Alexander
                    Maclure" was accepted by St. Stephen's. The Harmonists had to buy the land a second time.</p>
            <p>By April, 1850, after Alexander's death, St. Stephen's Vestry determined to sell their portion of the
                    Hall, probably because the parish had just built a new church and needed the money. Various
                    proposals were made, and in a few months they accepted a $1,000 offer. Many problems,
                    however, held up the conclusion of business including the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>In April, 1855, Alvin J. Hovey sued the three owners for either the return or repurchase of the
                        property.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> For a few years following William's death in 1840, his brother
                    and sister reported on the estate to the proper authorities. For example, on August 10, 1844, the
                    income was reported as $88,725.37 and the outgo $26,354.76. The latter figure
                    displays a scandalous misuse of funds. By 1848 the state authorities realized they were receiving no
                    inventories or reports, nor indeed any information regarding the settlement of the estate. The
                    sheriff was ordered on several occasions to bring Alexander in for explanations. Investigation of
                    his squandering of the estate led to the appointment of an administrator, Alvin P. Hovey, at the

            <p>The Maclure lawsuit and the establishment of workingmen's libraries that followed are abundantly

                    </placeName> Circuit Court, 1840–1859. All phases of the lawsuit are described: the
                    actions of the two Maclures, court judgments, inventory of personal effects, petitions for removal
                    to another venue (since sitting judge John Pitcher was not a disinterested presider),<hi rend="sup">21</hi> the hiring of appraisers, lists of land and town lots "sold or given
                    away," resale of these properties by Hovey, lists of property sold and prices received.
                    Several pages mainly concern the libraries established: their constitutions, membership lists with
                    occupations, and titles of books they possessed.</p>
            <p>Alvin P. Hovey (1821–1891) of <geogName>Mt. Vernon</geogName>, Indiana, was the man who
                    undertook to restore the Maclure will and saved Maclure's munificent bequest for its intended
                    recipients. Hovey had begun the study of law in the office of Judge John Pitcher and by age
                    twenty-two was admitted to the bar. He served as a delegate to the Indiana Constitutional Convention
                    (1850), judge of the circuit court (1851–1854), judge of the state supreme court the
                    following year, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> district attorney (1856–1860). He fought in the Civil War with distinction
                    and attained the rank of major general. Following the war he served five years as <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> minister to Peru (1865–1870). He was elected to Congress in 1886 and
                    governor of Indiana in 1888. After serving three years, he died in office.</p>
            <p>Hovey's interest in the matter of Maclure's will began when he was a student in Judge Pitcher's
                    office. Anna and Alexander, though cared for generously in their brother's will, wanted more. They
                    had sought legal opinion regarding the provisions for libraries from judges John Pitcher of
                        <geogName>Mt. Vernon</geogName>, Horace Binney of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Samuel Judah of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, all of whom assured them that the bequest was invalid because the libraries for which
                    it was created were not yet in existence. In studying the will and the opinions Hovey became
                    convinced that the bequest to the workingmen's institutes was valid, and that Maclure's relatives,
                    who were blithely consuming the substance of the estate, had no legal right to do so.</p>
            <p>Finally, the situation became so egregious that the court intervened and appointed Hovey as
                    administrator in 1849. Alexander Maclure died some months later, and James Sampson, who had been his
                    agent and administrator of his estate, was handed a defeat by <list type="footnotes">

                    made by Alexander null and void.</p>
            <p>Hovey proceeded to carry Maclure's will into effect, the first order of business being repossession
                    of the land sold by the self-appointed heirs. By instituting over sixty lawsuits Hovey managed to
                    recover the properties for resale. It must be admitted that having to buy one's property twice
                    caused considerable hardship to some persons who had originally dealt with Alexander in good
                        faith.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> The court records, however, included new, lower appraisals that
                    took into account the improvements made by the former owners.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> As nearly as can
                    be judged, Hovey realized $75,619.99 from the sales of the land, an amount from which he
                    could begin allotting the gifts of money to aspiring libraries.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Maclure case provided Hovey with a good start on his financial career. By winning the supreme
                    court appeal, he gained a statewide reputation and was launched on his political career.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Quoted in a 1949 clipping, Indiana Justice Frank E. Gilkinson, speaking in
                        <geogName>Mt. Vernon</geogName> at a salute to Hovey, stated that from this lawsuit came
                    "an opinion and judgment that have become the foundation of such bequests."<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Hovey accumulated cash from the sale of the Maclure estate, library petitions began appearing. By
                    the time the money was distributed, 144 libraries in Indiana (eighty-nine of the ninety-two counties
                    applied) and 16 in <placeName>

                        expenses for the granary that he had acquired from Anna Maclure. The considerable money he had
                        spent repairing the structure saved him from paying a large sum for remuneration. Compensation
                        amounted to $3,592.50 for the granary, the Maclure House his family occupied, and the

            <p>It has been incorrectly stated, by persons usually quoting each other, that the books purchased with
                    the Maclure funds were largely works of a scientific or technical nature having little interest for
                    the class—workingmen—for whom the donor had intended them. Quite the contrary.
                    Even a brief reading of the above-mentioned sources proves the opposite: there were novels,
                    biographies and history, travel, science, government documents, agriculture. Here are a few
                    examples: <placeName>

            <p>Some groups did organize with the desire of acquiring the $500 gift but lacked all
                    requisites for a functioning library: no trained librarian and no quarters for the books. Many
                    societies used the homes of members or their places of business, as did the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Maclurian Institute, and the members served as librarians. Current works and popular
                    classics were "read to pieces," according to contemporary accounts. Scientific or
                    technical works were reserved for reference.</p>
            <p>The Civil War was crucial to the survival of these libraries. The men went to war and the women to
                    nursing. Reading interests focused on matters concerning the war. Many libraries at this time were
                    no longer viable even though the books themselves did not vanish.</p>

                    basis of the future school, society, public, and township libraries. These latter libraries were
                    proposed and introduced by Robert Dale Owen in an 1854 measure, thereby continuing to implant and

                        nothing else appealed, the life of Alexander the Great was worth re-reading. The library was
                        presided over by an old English shoe maker named Knibs and as long as he lived it was carefully
                        tended. Later it fell into uninterested hands and has no doubt long since disappeared from

            <p>An inevitable comparison between William Maclure and Andrew Carnegie comes to mind. Carnegie
                    (1835–1919), also a Scotsman, was born seventy-two years after Maclure. The world,
                    particularly the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, differed drastically between 1783, when Maclure first visited the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and 1848, when Carnegie's family arrived. Maclure's America was that of Jefferson and
                    the founding fathers, a land undergoing all the stresses and strains of a new nation seeking its
                    identity in a relatively "New World." Carnegie's America was well on its way, an
                    immigrant mecca experiencing rampant westward expansion, a nation propelled by "Manifest
                    Destiny" and an Industrial Revolution in full bloom.</p>
            <p>Both men were businessmen and philanthropists; each was wealthy, though not in the same proportion.
                    Maclure made his money in merchandising, farmlands, and town properties in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and abroad; Carnegie accumulated his wealth from railroads, telegraph companies, oil
                    lands, bridge building, and steel. Carnegie gave to construct schools, churches, and cultural
                    institutions; Maclure gave to sponsor education and social reform. Both men, however, thought
                    libraries were ideal vehicles for helping their fellowmen. Carnegie provided funds for library
                    buildings in his lifetime; Maclure provided for library books in his will. Each gave money to those
                    who would match the gifts with their own planning and generosity.</p>
            <p>One of Carnegie's goals in life was to avoid the sin of dying a millionaire. Maclure's main concerns
                    were for the men who worked with their hands—women, orphans, and slaves. Carnegie, the
                    less altruistic, is yet admired today. Maclure, except for the scientific world, is scarcely known.</p>
