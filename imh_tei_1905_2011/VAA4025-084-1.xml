            <head>EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>The articles that make up this thematic issue of the Indiana Magazine of History were delivered first
                    at a conference on the Northwest ordinances held at Indiana University, September 4-6, 1987. Over a
                    period of two days approximately three hundred par–ticipants, interested laymen,
                    students, and scholars, heard a series of papers analyzing the ordinances. The papers provoked much
                    discussion from the audience, confirming the organizers' conviction that serious meetings
                    of this sort can attract a varied gathering of people, many of whom are not involved professionally
                    in the scholarly world. The Indiana University History Department and the Alum–ni
                    Association sponsored the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> conference jointly.</p>
            <p>The conference formed part of a wider celebration of the ordi–nances that involved
                    activities in the five states of the Old North– west and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>. Besides the conference in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and similar proceedings held in the other states, one of the highlights of the
                    celebration was an exhibit of materials designed to illumi–nate the Constitution and the
                    ordinances and scheduled to appear at six major libraries and historical societies in the Midwest.
                    The initiative in organizing this celebration came from Frank B. Jones, former director of the
                    Indiana University Alumni Association. Funds for these activities were generously contributed by the
                    Na–tional Endowment for the Humanities, the Commission on the Bi–centennial of
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Constitution, Indiana University, the Lilly Endowment, the George and Frances Ball
                    Foundation, and the John W. Anderson Foundation.</p>
            <p>In this bicentennial year attention to the ordinances seemed particularly appropriate for the
                    Midwest. In a symbolic way the ordinances have long been seen, certainly in the states between the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, as documents of constitutional import, simi–lar if not equal to the
                    Constitution itself. Popular wisdom, of course, has been inclined to celebration rather than
                    critical examination and for good reason. If the ordinances proved to be ambiguous
                    doc–uments as the republic advanced across the continent, they estab–lished
                    general principles that have served well the American inclination to reach beyond itself. State
                    equality, partible inheri–tance, a wide distribution of land, public support for
                    education, and a preference for freedom over slavery were only some of the ideals that found
                    expression in the ordinances. Often at odds with the realities of American life and slow to
                    realization, they have in time become enduring testimony to the genius of the founding
                    genera–tion. Scholarly attention has been inclined to stress the distance that so often
                    persisted between principle and reality, though the point could not have been made if the principle
                    had not itself been part of the reality. Oddly the ordinances have been neglected <pb n="2" id="VAA4025-084-1-006"/> in the last generation. The articles printed in this issue, each by a
                    major scholar in the field, constitute an important effort to revital–ize a critical area
                    of American history.</p>
            <p>On the cover of the issue appears one of the Vaughan portraits of George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> painted by Gilbert Stuart. The painting, now owned by Indiana University, was the gift
                    of Eli Lilly and served as the centerpiece of the traveling exhibition. <placeName>

                    </placeName> took no direct part in the making of the ordinances, but the article by W. W. Abbot in
                    this issue will amply demonstrate his centrality in the opening of the West. As a frontispiece we
                    have reproduced a watercolor by Lefevre J. Cranstone, a mid–nineteenth century
                    art–ist, that offers a vivid glimpse of the water route followed by so many of the early
                    settlers.</p>

                    </placeName>'s interest in his country's advancing frontier was both personal and
                    political. Private interest and public advantage were for him seldom at odds as he extended or
                    developed his holdings in the West and at the same time promoted public measures that made for the
                    greater security and accessibility–and value–of such lands. A full review of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    </placeName> troops, he was again out on the <placeName>

                    surrender to a party of French soldiers and Indians, setting in motion, as it happened, a great war
                    for empire between Britain and <placeName>

                    Braddock's army was ambushed and routed as it approached Fort Duquesne, the fort that the

                    the future development of these western lands by involving himself in a public project that was to

                    public campaign to use the Potomac to develop better access to the West and tie it to the East. He
                    urged Harrison to mark his administration "as an important e r a in the Annals of this
                    Country" by taking two specific steps to promote inland navigation: first, Harrison should
                    arrange for the state to have the James and Potomac rivers surveyed "to their respective
                    sources" and to have the same done for those "Waters East &amp; West of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> expected this to be the case–he should induce it to pass a bill empowering
                    private citizens to set up a company for "extending the navigation of Potomac or James

            <p>In this letter to Harrison written on October 10, and in those he wrote to others later in the fall
                    of 1784 regarding the navigation of the Potomac, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> set out his enlarged views of the West. It becomes clear why inland navigation was the
                    one thing that could draw the hero of the Revolution back into the public arena so quickly and
                    unequivocally. He was convinced, as he wrote Harrison, that the <placeName>

                    </placeName> country would "settle faster than any other ever did, or any one would
                    imagine." The hordes of new settlers inevitably would demand outlets for their products.
                    Whoever provided the outlets–the Spanish to the south, the British to the north, or the
                    Americans to the east–would win their allegiance. It is a matter "of great

                    "the trade of that Country should flow through the Mississipi or St Lawrence…
                    they would in a few years be as unconnected with us, indeed more so, than we are with South

                    to the extension of the inland navigation of the rivers Potomac and James," he made his
                    point unmistakably clear, declaring that "if this Country … cannot, by any easy
                    communication be drawn this way… they will become a distinct people from

            <p>I have been teaching the survey course of American history for forty years; and from the beginning of
                    that long career I have always tried to underscore the importance and value of the Articles of
                    Confederation by pointing out that it was the Congress under the Articles that passed the Northwest
                    Ordinance, one of the most important, progressive, and far–reaching legislative acts in
                    our history. It is, in fact, difficult to come up with a piece of legislation passed by Congress
                    under the Constitution that is as significant. What is ironic is that the record of the vote on the
                    Northwest Ordinance shows only eighteen delegates present in Congress on July 13, 1787, when it was
                    passed, and most of the eighteen were supposedly second–rate in ability and relatively
                    unknown. The important men in the country at the time were attending the Constitutional Convention
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>–--or, like Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, were out of the country. A
                    number of years later, in 1830, Daniel Webster had occasion to invoke the Ordinance on the floor of
                    the Senate during his celebrated reply to Robert Y. Hayne. Said he: "we are accustomed,
                    sir, to praise the lawgivers of antiquity … but I doubt whether one single law of any
                    lawgiver, ancient or modern, has produced effects of more distinct, marked, and lasting character
                    than the ordinance of '87… . We see its consequences at this moment, and we
                    shall never cease to see them, perhaps, while the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

            <p>There is always the danger of indulging in hyperbole when speaking of the consequences of the
                    Ordinance; what was achieved, what was provided, things like "Free Schools, Free Churches,
                    Free Soil, Free Men," etc. What I should like to attempt here, however, is a discussion of
                    some of the more political ramifications of this extraordinary document, ramifications that
                    profoundly altered conceptions <list type="footnotes">

                    based on research not of the Northwest Territory itself but of the Southwest Territory, specifically
                    the early history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> and to a much lesser extent the early history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Lest this focus appear unrelated, I would remind you that although <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> were not territorially connected to the area of what became <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, <placeName>

               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, they fell under the Ordinance's principal provisions as they moved from
                    frontier to statehood, just as many other states thereafter. And they entered the Union before any
                    of those from the Northwest: <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> in 1792, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> in 1796. Except for the provisions concerning slavery, and perhaps those dealing with
                    the Indians, the remaining articles of the Ordinance had a tremendous impact on both <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, and perhaps the experience in these two states suggests some important conclusions
                    about what happened in the Northwest. I might also point out that between 1781 and 1802 the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> received over 400,000 square miles from states with western land claims, of which only
                    265,000 square miles fell within the Northwest Territory; yet, the Ordinance affected all of that
                    area.</p>
            <p>As is obvious, the Ordinance, in a number of specific and important ways, established a governmental
                    policy not only for the Northwest but for the entire public domain in the future.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is possibly unique and most important in the Ordinance, I believe, is that it successfully
                    prevented the republic from collapsing immediately into an empire, and this it did by providing (or,
                    rather, anticipating) a new concept of Union. I am not sure "collapsing" is the
                    appropriate operative word here, but I cannot think of a better one offhand. It has been my
                    experience in reading and studying history that all republics become empires sooner or later before
                    their ultimate decline and fall. Once they acquire territory beyond the original limits, of
                    necessity they evolve into empires. Note the Roman Republic; note the Venetian Republic; note the
                    French Republic. And there are many other examples.</p>
            <p>Certainly in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the 1780s there was a great deal of talk about empire, then and later. On the
                    frontier westerners worried about empire, about the imperial or colonial intentions of the East, and
                    they talked about it quite freely. Back east a t the seat of government they also talked about
                    empire—sometimes indirectly, such as how the West could best be exploited and controlled.
                    Later, Jefferson himself spoke of an "empire for liberty" when referring <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>, and it was not uncommon for others to think in imperial terms when discussing the
                    future of the West. Andrew Jackson, for example, had a dream of empire that included all Spanish
                    North America.</p>
            <p>What spared Americans from moving immediately and directly into a structure of imperialism was the
                    Northwest Ordinance, in that it decreeed the stages and means by which territories would become
                    states equal to all other states in the Union. Colonial status, or exploitation by the older
                    ("original") states, could not and did not happen. What is ironic, of course, is
                    that the North–west Ordinance did, in fact, impose colonial rule on the territory in its
                    initial stage. A governor, secretary, and judges were appointed by the central government in the
                    east to administer the territory. Even so, statehood was inevitable once the territory reached the
                    prescribed population; and that inevitability had a profound impact on the West—the
                    entire West, as it turned out—both within and without the Northwest Territory.</p>
            <p>I regard the Ordinance as the great bulwark of the republic because I believe a real threat existed
                    at the end of the eighteenth century that this country might so easily have taken the wrong turn
                    toward an imperialistic approach to the West and thereby have created for itself insuperable
                    problems that would have spelled its immediate doom. What exacerbated the situation was the constant
                    danger of treason against the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> by Westerners. The presence of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> and Great Britain always constituted a threat to the Union, and the presence of the
                    Indians added to the threat because they were the pawns in the international political game. It
                    seemed obvious that if the West were to remain in the hands of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> following the Revolution then something had to be done about the British and Spanish,
                    for they continued to retain considerable portions of land within the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, north and south.</p>
            <p>This external threat to the nation was matched by the internal threat to its safety; namely, the
                    anger and frustration Westerners felt toward the central government in failing to rid them of the
                    Indian problem or dealing effectively with foreign interference with their trade, such as the
                    Spanish interference from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Moreover, they were convinced that a conspiracy existed in the East to keep them out
                    of the confederacy except as dependent colonists.</p>
            <p>I can explain better what I mean by using the history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> as a case in point. During the Revolution Scotch–Irish from

                    </placeName> moved steadily westward and squatted on land both north and south of the <geogName>Ohio
                        River</geogName>. Years later, during the debate on preemption in 1841, Senator Willie P. Mangum
                    was accused of implying that squatters in the west were "a sort of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>

                    every peaceable man in the community."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Since such an opinion was
                    prevalent during the post–Revolutionary years as well, it is small wonder that the
                    Congress felt these ruffians needed a strong and stable government in the West. No doubt, these
                    brawling, browbeating monsters had two main concerns in migrating west: their economic livelihood
                    and the presence and danger of the Indian. To address these concerns they turned to all manner of
                    deception, intrigue, and conspiracy.</p>
            <p>The Scotch–Irish who came to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> were always described as "greedy after land." They were outside the
                    bounds of any organized government and so in 1772 took it upon themselves to establish the Watauga
                    Association, which provided for a sheriff, clerk, and a court with legislative and judicial powers.
                    They assumed that the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768 had settled the problem of land ownership
                    because the Iroquois (who had only a shadowy claim to the region) relinquished all the land south of
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>. Of course the Indians in the immediate area did not see it quite that way, especially
                    the Cherokees who carried out a fierce war against the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> settlers in 1776. There was the real danger a t this time that a British army would
                    march from West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> with Creeks, Chickasaws, and Cherokees to attack the entire frontier of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>. Fortunately, it did not happen, but the presence of the British and the Spanish
                    increasingly influenced the politics of the southwestern frontier. Eventually the Cherokees were
                    defeated and forced to sign treaties relinquishing their rights, but that did not end the raids,
                    especially from the Chickamauga towns.</p>

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>

                    </placeName> (and beyond that point on the west side), and concluded important treaties with the
                    Indians. Thus, at the conclusion of the Revolution the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was no more able to drive the Spanish from the southwest than it was to expel the

                    immediately ready for home rule; thus, when they heard of Jefferson's Ordinance of 1784,

                    Congress sat on its collective hands, and it did so, in part, because, as Robert F. Berkhofer has
                    pointed out, Jefferson's Ordinance of 1784 merely provided a framework of general rules for
                    establishing government in the West and was not intended to take effect immediately.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Naturally, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, for daring to initiate this treason against the state. Sevier responded by contacting

                    interesting is that this plunge into treasonable conspiracy does not occur in the Northwest as it
                    does in the Southwest.</p>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government could do nothing, the Cumberland settlement offered to secede and take an

                    wondered aloud how a rank outsider like Jackson could inject himself into the secret councils of

                    independent nation. There were, of course, problems with the Indians, and the British still remained
                    holed up in their forts along the Canadian border, which posts they were supposed to vacate
                    according to the terms of the peace treaty that ended the Revolution. Wilkinson went to <placeName>

            <p>What made the difference, what completely turned the situation around, was the passage of the
                    Northwest Ordinance. Now the West knew that Congress had a policy with respect to the territories
                    and that that policy meant colonial rule until such time as the settlers were prepared to take their
                    place as co–equals with the other states in the Union. The <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would expand, not as an empire with subject peoples and territory but by the addition
                    of new, sovereign states; and these states, in the words of the Ordinance, would be "on an
                    equal footing with the original States in all respects whatsoever."</p>
            <p>It was a new concept of Union. No longer was the <placeName>

                    </placeName> a static collection of independent states quarreling among themselves over vested
                    rights. This new concept was a dynamic expression of an expanding country controlled by a central
                    government in which new states would be added to the Union by its authority and action. Control
                    remained at the center and thereby strengthened the national government; and all the states were
                    absolutely equal, no matter when—how early or late—they entered the Union.</p>

                    wanted their own territorial legislature and then statehood as quickly as possible. What attracted
                    them, of course, as it did most other Westerners, was the new concept of Union as advanced by the
                    Northwest Ordinance, which granted them equality and full status as a sovereign state once they had
                    completed the three stages. The inevitability of statehood was clear to them, and that made all the
                    difference in the world. The Northwest Ordinance also provided (necessarily) a strengthened central
                    government that would soon win them, first, access to, and then, ownership of, the
                        <geogName>Mississippi valley</geogName> and its mouth at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This was not a concept of a Union indifferent to the needs of its newest partners;
                    this Union, in the words of Peter S. Onuf, became the "guarantor of collective
                        interests."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> As such, it strengthened the Republic and provided
                    the surest bulwark against those who would betray it or plunge it disastrously into empire building.
                    The moment this new concept of Union occurred–that is, the moment the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> moved from a static American state system to a dynamic form that allowed for national
                    expansion by the deliberate process of adding new states under the guidance of the central
                    authority—in that moment the states having entered this Union no longer retained the
                    right of secession. Or so Jackson argued. He strongly advocated states rights, and he always
                    believed that this new and dynamic concept of Union in no way eliminated states rights; still, he
                    maintained that secession as the right of any state to redress its grievances was forfeited even
                    before the Constitution went into effect. Perhaps under the old static system secession was a legal
                    instrument to protect state rights. Not so under the new system. And I think Jackson was right. Not
                    that I care particularly about fixing an exact time when secession was lost to the states, but I
                    frankly cannot think of a better moment. It has generally been supposed that secession vanished as a
                    right when this country became a Union of people, rather than a confederation of states. Perhaps. I
                    am more inclined to accept the position that secession was lost when the <hi rend="i">concept</hi>
                    of Union changed. And it visibly and perceptibly changed when eighteen relatively unknown and
                    unaccomplished men enacted the Northwest Ordinance of 1787.</p>

                    tradition the Northwest Ordinance enjoys today presumably has to do not only with democratic
                    self–government but with a social democracy of self–reliant, egalitarian
                    pioneer farmers living in a distinctively midwestern "open country

            <p>Sober historians, however, as early as Jacob Burnet's recollected Notes on the Early

                    </placeName> in 1947, have tended to dissent from this nostalgic tradition. Insofar as social
                    democracy did eventually develop in the Old Northwest, it was due to subsequent amendment of the
                    ordinances of the 1780s, especially to progressive easing of the original 640–acre
                    minimum purchase in the Ordinance of 1785 to, by 1820, the 80 acres that an ordinary farmer could
                    afford; to, still later, the Preemption Act of 1841 that gave the squatter first choice; and to the
                    Homestead Act of 1862 that offered 160–acre farms free. Only thus gradually, in
                    Burnet's traditional republican phrases, were "men of limited means"
                    enabled to become "freeholders, and independent cultivators of their own domain, who,

                        along.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The Ordinance of 1787 was never amended so explicitly, and a
                    generation ago the legal historian Francis S. Philbrick laboriously debunked it as not democratic at
                    all, labeling it instead "a true colonial system" that permitted less
                    self–government than under British rule before the Revolution.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> And
                    now Peter S. Onuf concludes that the two ordinances were little concerned with social arrangements,
                    democratic or undemocratic, but rather with economic development of the West and with land sales as
                    a steady source of revenue for the much–indebted federal government.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                    To the degree that Congress, then or later, did address itself to social ends, as Mary E. Young has
                    observed, it equated "the disposal of land to small holders with settlement, and settlement
                    with development."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Social policy was merged into economic policy.</p>
            <p>And yet however ill–founded in fact the popular sense of the ordinances of the 1780s may
                    be, that sense itself is a historical reality. It is above all a tradition of family farms and
                    independent small businesses, a tradition which is still compelling enough to command special
                    subsidies, tax advantages, and exemption from foreclosure for their proprietors—even
                    benefit pop–music concerts like those in aid of starving African children. Because it is
                    a libertarian tradition, Americans are apt to think first, when the Ordinance of 1787 comes to mind,
                    of its final clause, which forthrightly (it seemed) prohibited slavery everywhere northwest of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>—a clause so unlike the compromises and euphemisms in the Constitution that
                    was also drafted in the summer of 1787. And the opening clause, though less often remarked upon, was
                    no less remarkable, prescribing as it did equal inheritance by all siblings, daughters as well as
                    sons. For whatever reason, the place of the ordinances of the 1780s in the national tradition may be
                    as significant as all the factual niggling by historians.</p>
            <p>So deep–running a tradition certainly calls for more detailed research—which,

                    possible origins of the tradition. This view goes back not just to 1620 or 1607 but some thousands
                    of years, literally beyond tradition to that time so immemorial that even the memory of the folk
                    runneth not, to the long–forgotten but recently unearthed era of the first agricultural
                    settlement of northern Europe, especially, of course, of Britain. An American historian will be
                    struck by prefigurings of, if not exactly precedents for, settlement of the Old Northwest.
                    Archaeologists detect that the pre–Celtic aboriginals, two or three millennia B.C.,
                    carried out the first clearance of the forest cover in long rectangular swathes, regularly oriented
                    north–west to southeast, doggedly crossing streams and otherwise ignoring topography,
                    roughly in the manner of the federal survey system of 1785 which nineteenth century European critics
                    thought so unnatural. These clearances seem to have provided a "planned
                    frame–work within which individual fields were laid out"—small square
                    fields of less than an acre, the sort that farmers continued to use through the Celtic and Roman
                    eras and the first several hundred years of Anglo–Saxon occupation.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                    As the archaeologist P. J . Fowler observes, "fields in later prehistoric southern
                    Britain… were generally rectangular in shape, whatever the geology, with a tendency
                    towards squarishness."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The similarity to the later American pattern is
                    not surprising if, as the geographer Hildegarde Binder Johnson says of "colonial settlement
                    patterns of western and non–western … societies" alike,
                    "planners resort to rectangularity all over the world."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

                    penetrates a good many archaeological levels below that eighteenth century Enlightenment rationality

            <p>The whole picture of prehistoric Britain now looks oddly familiar: "an enormous
                    effort," Fowler concludes, "by a few million people during the last two millennia
                    BC to bring large tracts of country under systematic control, not only on the grand scale with their
                    field systems, but also in the detail of many thousands of kilometres of field boundary, every
                    single centimetre of which was constructed in a variety of ways from an imaginary line to major

            <p>There are other strikingly familiar touches in the prehistoric settlement of Britain. Trees were
                    cleared by the slash–and–burn method of girdling and burning and then
                    scratch–plowing around the stumps until the seasons rotted them away–that same
                    laborsaving but prodigally wasteful Brandwirtschaft which in nineteenth century America shocked so
                    many observers used to the long since tidied–up landscapes of Europe. It was a slow
                    process even so—perhaps a third of a square mile, about two hundred acres, could be
                    cleared by a family in the course of one hundred years. Sometimes the farmer's task was
                    eased by already existing clearances, the product, as in North America, of fires set by the previous
                    population of hunters, the first postglacial inhabitants of 5000–4000 B.C.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>Archaeology tells us next to nothing, however, about prehistoric social relations. The little that
                    can be inferred again prefigures the Old Northwest. As Stuart Piggott has observed, "in no
                    instance have the exiguous remains recovered in Britain been capable of interpretation as centres
                    larger than a farm or homestead," one, moreover, "of the
                    ‘natural’ or ‘nuclear’ family type, conventionally set
                    at about five persons… . The archaeological evidence, such as it is, favours a
                    predominance of settlements of Einzelhof type over larger aggregations of village

                    war band, the first part of the placename commemorating its chieftain. That would make them communal
                    settlements from the first. Now the eponymous Dark Age Beorma of Birmingham or Wassa of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    self–government had transatlantic roots–attributed a century ago to an
                    Anglo–Saxon or a Germanic racial trait, though suppressed for some hundreds of years by <placeName>

                    necessary for this self–government, especially in the cooperative open–field
                    villages, was no doubt arrived a t the more easily, in the High Middle Ages, because of the high
                    degree of social homogeneity—ethnic, religious, cultural—at least in any one
                    village by that time.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>English medievalists have been interested in two other phenomena: first, the remarkably free local
                    market for land and, second, the no less remarkably permissive customary pattern of inheritance. In
                    both cases the practical degree of personal liberty quite belied the legal technicalities of
                    manorial tenure with which medievalists used to be preoccupied. It turns out that law was one thing,
                    local custom quite another.</p>
            <p>The local land market—which consisted of one farmer's leasing odd acres from
                    another, less often the sale of one family's entire farm to another—was
                    determined by the ups and downs of individual and demographic circumstances, with little
                    interference from the lord, the legal proprietor of the manor. As long as the lord was paid the
                    fines due for such transfers, he seems (virtually everywhere that has been studied) to have found
                    this open land market as much to his advantage as to his tenants'. The farmer's
                    purpose in acquiring more land was not so much capitalistic—for the sake of accumulation
                    and self—gentrification-as it was simply to pass on to one son (more if possible) the
                    twelve to fifteen acres that would support the same self–reliant status that the father
                    had held. Only when the agrarian system was thrown into disarray—by the plague in the
                    late fourteenth century, ultimately by commercial modernization in the sixteenth and seventeenth
                    centuries and after—did some farmers find the opportunity for capitalistic accumulation
                    and aggrandizement.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inheritance likewise followed local custom, which varied from place to place but everywhere was far
                    more liberal than seigniorial. Technically, a tenant holding reverted to the lord on the
                    tenant's death, to be regranted to whomever the lord pleased; actually, the manor lord has
                    yet to be discovered who did not customarily prefer, of course on payment of the usual fine, the son
                    or sons or other relatives whom the deceased had named in his will. Sometimes, if the father lived
                    long enough, he conveyed the farm before his death but stipulated a sort of retirement contract for
                    his and his wife's maintenance as a condition of the son's holding the property.</p>

            <p>Daughters, and sons for whom there was not enough land for self–sustaining farms, received
                    personal property or cash or the assurance of some such support by the heir to the land. The purpose
                    of these inheritance customs was the same as that of the land market: to maintain, generation after
                    generation, the family on its holding. As Cicely Howell has summed it up, for one Leicestershire
                    village, the system "was expected to support all adult members [of a family], either by
                    supplying each with a share of land where possible, or [as was more usual] by supporting one nuclear
                    family and a number of celibate adults."<hi rend="sup">21</hi> If all these practices
                    foreshadowed the early days of the Old Northwest, so too, eventually, would the shift away from them

                    </placeName>. In social terms modernization involved no longer simply maintaining the family
                    securely on its traditional land but instead seeking to acquire and accumulate capital as
                    such—and much the same change occurred in the Old Northwest some two or three hundred
                    years later.</p>
            <p>Between <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and the Northwest, of course, lay colonial America in all its regional variety: the New <placeName>

                    </placeName> town, the open–country neighborhood of the Middle Colonies, and the farm and
                    plantation variant of the latter in the South. For all the regional differences, there seems to have
                    been a common underlying reason why the mass of English and other European settlers left the
                    homeland: to escape the effect of modernization, whether actually at hand or only threatened, on
                    their own social status. As the modern commercial economy grew, it offered less and less place for
                    self—reliant smallholding farmers or independent master artisans, or for the traditional
                    homogeneous community of such neighbors. Colonial emigration selected men and families of that
                    middling rural sort out of the much broader social spectrum throughout the colonial era and indeed
                    through the nineteeth century and into the twentieth. (If it be objected that by recent calculation
                    many or most indentured servants and other poor immigrants were from a lower social status, it would
                    be hard to demonstrate that they did not hope to gain, sometimes to regain, the middling level.)
                    This perennial characteristic of American immigration must have accentuated in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> a version of the traditional, premodern, quite archaic social mentality of the medieval
                    villager. Perhaps it is this, more than anything else, that has, ironically, made America
                    exceptional in the modern world.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

            <p>The undeveloped colonial economic environment naturally favored the less highly developed forms of
                    Old World local society—a throwback, so to speak, to the scattered farmsteads and
                    crossroads hamlets of prehistoric or unimproved, uncommercial medieval society. Those early New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> towns that deliberately laid out nucleated villages and open fields—too
                    labor–intensive in the circumstances—soon reverted to the more primitive
                        arrangements.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> It took the noneconomic purposes of the Puritans to keep up

                    German sectarians of the Middle Colonies. Elsewhere, something like the prehistoric settlement
                    pattern prevailed from the start: open–country neighborhoods of detached family
                    farmsteads—"plantations" of greater or smaller size—in a
                    landscape of forests that the aboriginal hunting population had burned off only here and there.
                    Since America reversed the mature European ratio of a short supply of land to an oversupply of
                    labor, closely settled communities were neither required nor even possible. Even so, communities
                    continued to be about as homogeneous as in the traditional Old World, especially in ethnic makeup:

                    servants and other poor newcomers failed to attain that ideal, most colonists did, whether they
                    were, on the one hand, well–established freeholders—sons succeeding
                    fathers—or, on the other, disreputable squatters trying to hold onto a piece of the
                    public land. There has been a flood of historical research on colonial

                    the progressive modernization—Yankeeization—that other recent historians have
                    pointed out in the commercial economy. The contrast with the southern tidewater regions is striking:
                    the mortality rate disrupted traditional family life among the malaria–defenseless
                    newcomers to the southern tidewater in the seventeenth century, and the relatively enormous estates
                    that some tobacco and then rice planters accumulated in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth
                    centuries made them, and their pattern of inheritance, more like the English gentlemen farmers who
                    were thriving in the early–modern commercial market than like their less fortunate
                    neighbors whose smallholdings they often engrossed. As the Chesapeake demography stabilized in the
                    eighteenth century, however, the family—indeed, great networks of
                    kinfolk—recovered to something like the patriarchal norm of premodern <placeName>

                    seen as another reversion to the primitive, even to the prehistoric. In the seventeenth century the
                    usual metes–and–bounds fashion of setting the boundaries of farms and other

            <p>The size of land purchases that would be available turns the question in the opposite, modern
                    direction. In 1774 the British government, as part of its stillborn attempt to reorganize colonial
                    administration, adopted a general system of prior survey and land–office auctions of lots
                    of from 100 to 1,000 acres. Although the Revolution intervened, independent <placeName>

                    traditional 50–acre headrights that Thomas Jefferson proposed to give to landless
                    families. If the sale of such large tracts was the "colossal mistake" that Thomas
                    Perkins Abernethy called it—a failure to secure "diffusion of small landholdings
                    among the people"—he, like Jefferson, was invoking an agrarian tradition closer

                    purchase—one square mile—was several times what an ordinary farmer needed or

                    the terms of sale, and historians have agreed that the original terms, in order to raise revenue,
                    had departed too far from the family–farm tradition of the prospective settlers.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> As one agricultural historian has observed, "The young Nation parted

                    over the ordinances of the 1780s was the classical fear that too large and scattered a society would
                    be unhomogeneous and hence unrepublican.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> That argument specifically pertained
                    to the size of future states, but the concern for social homogeneity echoed the practical experience
                    of most localities in both Europe and America as well as political theory. Unfortunately, even the
                    New Englanders who were still thought of as group migrants par excellence had not actually been
                    settling in that fashion for two or three generations, nor would many of them do so northwest of the <placeName>

            <p>If not homogeneous communities, then did the new system of survey and sale promote settlement by
                    individual families of the traditional sort? Toward that end the minimum purchase was reduced, by
                    1820, to 80 acres from the original 640. On the other hand objections raised by practical
                    agriculturists to the severely "rational" survey that so intrigued Jefferson and
                    other enlightened minds—after all, a less abstract Virginian remarked, nature had created
                    few parts of the country in squares—went almost entirely unheeded, then or later.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Prior survey was intended to enhance conveyancing, and square boundaries
                    contributed to certainty of title—both of course of real use to buyer as well as
                    seller—but they had little other use to farmers or communities of farmers. If, as the
                    agricultural historian Thomas LeDuc argued, the poor man who hoped to become an independent farmer
                    and respectable citizen needed credit more than anything, the four–year term for payment
                    of the purchase price that was offered between 1800 and 1820 was too short—no credit at
                    all was offered after 1820—and in any case federal loans to settlers, not simply delayed
                    payment, would have served a positive social policy as well as, for that matter, the economic policy
                    of rapid development of the West.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is to get as far ahead of the story as the notion of a federal loan program would have been
                    in nineteenth century America. To return to the ordinances of the 1780s: if they were indeed tilted
                    toward economic rather than social ends, what is the explanation for the two
                    clauses—those against slavery and for equal inheritance—that have cast much of

                    least, fully partible inheritance carried to its ultimate conclusion the direction in which
                    provincial law had been moving; exclusion of slavery before settlement of the new territory would
                    obviate there for all time the need to raise the question of its abolition, that question to which
                    only a few of the old states had yet responded and which would eventually embroil them all in the
                    Civil War.</p>
            <p>Although the symbolic value of these clauses is important, their practical effect has been
                    questioned. The inheritance clause, like most probate law, ruled only where the property owner left
                    no will; and of course the more property a man had, the likelier he was to make a will. Even as
                    moral example to will makers, the principle of equal shares to all would be apt to prevail only as
                    long as there was enough cheap land in a farmer's vicinity to enable him to provide each of
                    his children a competence to support a family—a situation unlikely to outlast the first

                    happier, if perhaps poorer, if slavery—black slavery—had never been introduced
                    into North America. The states-that is, the white citizens—that were quickest to abolish
                    slavery after the Revolution were those with the fewest blacks. To exclude slavery from the new
                    territories perhaps held out the prospect of excluding blacks almost altogether. The congressional
                    delegates were as silent about that as about the other considerations that historians have
                    suggested, but what is certain is that virtually no one in that age is known to have seen any

            <p>As long as historians evaluated community as the sum of individual successes, they seldom asked
                    whether the abstract rationality of the ordinances fostered or impeded community. The Old Northwest
                    seemed the quintessential home of democratic, egalitarian community, almost its birthplace (as it
                    was the birthplace of Frederick Jackson Turner), where settlements were united, not divided, by
                    their common individualism. Until recently only one major contrary tendency was recognized: the
                    scope which the absence of any limit to large–scale land speculation opened to
                    profiteering. "By 1855," Paul W. Gates has pointed out, "all the public
                    land in Indiana had been disposed of and yet [because so much of it was held by speculators] vast
                    stretches of the state were totally unimproved."<hi rend="sup">53</hi> The resulting gaps

                    </placeName> prairies in particular, somewhat delayed communal development.</p>
            <p>Ordinary farmers were also free to buy land beyond their farming needs; such investment evidently
                    seemed less contradictory to them than to the mid–twentieth century historians who
                    discovered they had done so much of it. Even the clubs that some squatters organized after the 1830s
                    to protect their claim to land they could not afford to buy now seem, in Allan G. Bogue's
                    words, to have been "a means of protecting [their speculative] trade in claims rather than
                    [as they asserted] a device to protect the home from the speculator… ."<hi rend="sup">54</hi> That confusion between home and investment came, however, a t a fairly late

                    cooperation of log–rollings, barn–raisings, and husking bees. (Frank L. Owsley
                    painted much the same picture of the same sort of people in the contemporary Old Southwest.)<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Such impressions seemed confirmed by the first of the quantitative local

                    </placeName> after 1850. Curti concluded that since the mixed Yankee and foreign settlers were
                    generally successful in attaining farm ownership, they did constitute the democratic
                    community—politically active, economically relatively equal, and socially
                    cooperative–of the frontier tradition. The individualistic urge to acquire land was
                    apparently quite compatible with egalitarian community; if anything, it was its essence.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Impediments to traditional community in the ordinances of the 1780s keep turning up, however. Some
                    are odd but not entirely incidental. The first roads, which often followed Indian trails along the
                    lie of the land—"angling" across the resolutely square sections of the
                    federal survey—had to be relocated, as the sections were occupied, into the
                    right–angled pattern that the present–day air traveler may still observe;
                    sometimes one of the correction lines of the survey forced the road to follow a still more abrupt
                    "offset." This seemed defensible to an engineer in the 1840s, who said that roads
                    should be laid out "on mathematical… [not] on social principles." (From
                    that point of view the mathematics of 1785 had been deficient only in leaving no space between the
                    sections for roads, so that it had to be taken from the property owners on either side.)<hi rend="sup">57</hi> In time, given the new engineering principles of the automobile age, many of
                    the corners would have to be rounded off and the survey sections angled through again.</p>
            <p>Profounder questions have been troubling historians recently, as they push the new local history from

                    settlers sought in the Old Northwest? If so, did they attain it, and when? What they sought was one
                    thing, predictable enough, given what is now known of their ancestry. Most of them were, like former
                    migrants, of a traditional mentality, concerned to "support by honest Industery,"

                    the dispossession of the Kickapoo in 1815 down to the second, Civil War–era generation.
                    The Sugar Creek settlement became a remarkably organic community, in spite of its mixed Yankee,
                    Southern Upland, and foreign population, bound together by a "web of common
                    obligations" into "multiple structures—of association and collective
                    action, of neighborhood and kinship, of belief and ritual," centering around mill and
                    schoolhouse, working together on the township roads, herding livestock on the unclaimed public
                    prairie, driving hogs or wagons to the Alton or <placeName>

                    "a collection of emigrant families into community, with all its attendant harmony and
                    strife"–a community reminiscent of those of Toby Ditz's <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Cicely Howell's Leicestershire.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> To be sure, it was a
                    hard–headed, unsentimental sort of community where each farm or artisan family kept
                    strict account of every pennyworth of goods and labor its neighbors owed it, not exactly the
                    selfless, voluntary cooperators of the romantic tradition which previous historians have echoed. (As
                    Faragher notes, Caroline Kirkland, on the <placeName>

                    say "thank you.")<hi rend="sup">60</hi> But then, there is no evidence that
                    traditional English or colonial neighbors had been any less hard–headed and
                    unsentimental.</p>
            <p>The Sugar Creek community was also limited—the same thing has been noted
                    elsewhere—to a core of families within the larger local population at any one time, a
                    minority who managed to take root and eventually to intermarry into a web of kinship, while

            <p>What, then, does this celebration of the ordinances of the 1780s commemorate? Were these documents
                    only a program for opening this vast new land to easy acquisition and capital-accumulation? If so,
                    they subverted the ancient ideal of self-reliant families in homogeneous community, to preserve
                    which so many men and women had come. And if there was some aspect of that social tradition that the
                    ordinances did effectively preserve through the nineteenth century, it was what was coming to stand
                    for social homogeneity—not ethnic homogeneity, since no limit was set on who, native or
                    foreign, might come, and not economic classlessness, since men were free to make what they could of
                    their opportunities—but white racial homogeneity. If the antislavery clause of 1787
                    ensured anything, it was—in spite of Governor Arthur Sinclair's loose
                    interpretation of it in the 1790s and efforts in Indiana after 1800 and <placeName>

            <p>The text for the relationship between the citizens of the Northwest Territory and the public domain
                    was set by Sir William Blackstone. "There is nothing which so generally strikes the
                    imagination and engages the affections of mankind," he wrote in his <hi rend="i">Commentaries,</hi> "as the right of property; or that sole and despotic dominion which
                    one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, to the total exclusion of the
                    right of any other individual in the universe." Blackstone and later others accepted the
                    idea that a "set of words upon parchment" should "convey dominion on
                        land."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> For the first Americans it did, and it still does.</p>
            <p>From the opening of the seventeenth century to the middle of the nineteenth, land was a central theme
                    in American life. For these two-and-one-half centuries, individuals and families in the colonies and
                    later in the independent American nation sought to acquire it; investors (or speculators if you
                    prefer) capitalized on its scarcity to make fortunes; society's values everywhere reflected
                    its influence. Land was simultaneously a commodity and a value system. As a commodity it was
                    symbolized by the search of generation after generation for a "freehold estate,"
                    the tangible form of permanent wealth that might be willed to subsequent generations, a universally
                    acknowledged symbol in most communities of achievement and permanence. Land as value system meant a
                    rural world in which land and land ownership were the dominant economic, social, and political
                    values to which all aspired and in which ownership of land became a bench mark of status, whether in
                    the colonies or, after 1776, in the new American nation.</p>

                    <pb n="47" id="VAA4025-084-1-051"/> one hundred fifty years and across half a continent,
                    politicians, military leaders, and bureaucrats in Whitehall established institutional forms to give
                    structure and direction to the search for land and to govern its distribution: Indian treaties to
                    extinguish the title of the original inhabitants; crown grants of land to individual court favorites
                    or stock companies; activities by speculators and people of influence in the several colonies; acts
                    and laws by Parliament to regulate land distribution; and numerous court decisions on the terms and
                    circumstances under which land in the colonies might be acquired and sold.</p>
            <p>In 1776 the new independent American nation took over many of these same forms, initially at least
                    with the substantial confusion attending a revolution and the uncertainty associated with
                    inexperience. Within this new proprietorship and responsibility the Ordinance of 1787, in
                    conjunction with the Ordinance of 1785, represented a significant bench mark in the attempt of those
                    who framed policy for the nation to affirm the importance of land in society and to establish the
                    principles that would govern its acquisition by the government and its distribution to the citizens
                    of the Republic. The Ordinance of 1787 also established a new framework of government for the West
                    that reflected much about the influence of land in the colonial world.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is this old colonial world that first captures attention, for it provides a context within which
                    to understand the significance and scope of the provisions of the Northwest Ordinance for government
                    and for land distribution west of the mountains. What the Congress and its leaders did in the West
                    reflected the experiences east of the mountains. The first <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> colony brought together many of the features that would become associated with land in
                    its many dimensions: a large stock company created for profit; the transition from corporate to
                    individual land ownership; energetic pursuit of freehold estates. The results of these experiences
                    were a dispersed, rural society. The development of tobacco culture as a commercial crop in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> and its rapid spread created a world with growing class distinctions based on land
                    ownership that within two short generations had intensified the rural nature of this world and
                    agrarian values. And these characteristics intensified with the addition of African slave labor. At
                    the same time, stretching toward the West on every hand lay a forested expanse of unclaimed land to
                    which the landless might have recourse in order to realize their own dreams of a freehold estate.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    one with its own values and directions; but it, too, rapidly became a world associated with the
                    possession of land. A community that spoke of itself as "a city on a hill" soon
                    evolved into a series of villages, moving out in ever widening concentric circles into the
                    wilderness. Land was the triggering impulse to settlement and, soon, to social and economic
                    influence. While some land was held in common, substantial portions were parcelled out to the
                    village families, in free tenure, as personal property, without obligations of continuing payment to
                    a landlord and with no quit rents.</p>

                    mechanisms that awarded some families more land than others and in the finite amount of available
                    land. Eventually it was all given out. The solution was the founding of a new town on
                    unclaimed—Indian claims were not considered real claims—lands, where the
                    process of distribution could be repeated with different beneficiaries. During the last years of the

            <p>Other systems of land allocation emerged in other colonies: the distribution of large tracts of land
                    to favorites, a system that prevailed along the Hudson and Mohawk rivers where millions of acres of
                    land were granted to men of influence; grants of princely domains to court favorites in the

                    William Penn, decided to distribute lands widely and cheaply with a small annual quit rent.
                    Thousands, eventually hundreds of thousands, accepted his offer and that of his heirs, although few
                    paid the annual rent. The Penns wanted compact settlements, and they believed that their generous
                    terms for distribution of land would allow them to set the settlement patterns of the colony. As a
                    practical matter, the regulations were impossible to enforce and soon ignored.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                    around agriculture, and much large-scale investment was associated with lands. Furthermore, lands
                    had become an important measure of social standing and political influence, for by tradition large
                    land owning families were the most prominent socially and only those with landed estates could vote
                    and hold office in most of the colonies.</p>
            <p>Throughout the colonies—on a lower level, far removed from the schemes of large landed
                    entrepreneurs-there was another group with its ambitions linked to land: much of colonial life
                    continued to revolve around the search for a "freehold estate." This was still the
                    symbol of independence and standing in colonial life, the ultimate reward for those who had left the
                    closed land system of the Old World for the universal opportunities for land ownership in the New.
                    It was a search pursued from the stony hills of the New <placeName>

                    </placeName> upcountry to the tidal marshes of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Indeed, by the middle of the eighteenth century this unending search was one of the
                    common qualities that bound together colonies otherwise separated by much increasing diversity. The
                    historian Wesley Frank Craven wrote of this world and this theme, "Surely, if there was one
                    thing which bound the colonists together in a common experience, it was the necessity they found,
                    most of them at least, to dig their livelihood out of the soil."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mixed in with the continuing search for lands was the astonishing growth of the colonies in the
                    generation from 1730 to 1760. Accompanying this growth was an enlarged perception of the scarcity of
                    land and the parallel rise in price and pressure to open up new land. For the first time some men
                    began to talk and others scheme about opening the lands west of the Appalachians. With the higher
                    prices more families settled illegally on lands—or squatted, as the term came to be used.
                    And with growing illegal settlement came clashes with authorities. The argument appeared that these
                    pioneer families by their presence risked their lives to provide a buffer between the established
                    settlements and the hostile Indian tribes. For the squatters the result was a conflict with
                    authorities and owners mixed with demands for compensation for their labors and special
                    consideration in purchasing their lands at a favorable rate. These were all issues and attitudes
                    that would emerge in vivid form in the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> in the 1780s and across most
                    of the trans-Appalachian frontier in the first half of the nineteenth century.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>The American Revolution did not represent a dramatic shift in the sense of priorities, for the
                    changes that emerged did not lessen the importance of land within the several American societies but
                    simply recast the rules for its acquisition and exploitation. The principles of the Revolution, no
                    easy thing to define, may be summarized with respect to land in a negative way: that it was no
                    crusade against private property. In its outbursts against those who were charged with having
                    unfairly monopolized lands (such as the Penns) or in the urge to confiscate the property of
                    loyalists, the revolutionaries confirmed the importance of land in American life, in this case, the
                    life of the new, independent American nation. Presumably, the close of the Revolution simply set the
                    stage for a resumption of the search for a "freehold estate," whether on a large
                    scale by planters or speculators or on a more modest scale by individual pioneer families across the
                    breadth of the colonies.</p>
            <p>Even before the close of the war, the Congress of the Confederation had begun a long struggle to come
                    to terms with the issues dividing the several states, of which one of the most prominent and bitter
                    was that of the western lands. The legacy of colonial charters threatened to divide the states into
                    two camps: those with great landed estates in the interior of the continent as a legacy of their
                    charters, and those without such landed riches. The latter found themselves imprisoned on one side
                    by the Atlantic Ocean and on the other by inflexible boundaries in such a way as to restrict their
                    expansion and so, in a nation of landowners, their growth. In their own minds this restriction
                    condemned them forever to second class status as partners in a shaky union of supposedly equal
                    states.</p>
            <p>The Congress of the Confederation moved to allay these concerns and give the nation a princely legacy
                    by providing for the cession of these western claims. The resolution of October 10, 1780, laid out
                    three principles: first, that the "unappropriated lands" of the states should be
                    "ceded or relinquished"; second, that such cessions should be used "for
                    the common benefit of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>"; third, that the lands so settled shall be "formed into distinct
                    republican states, which shall become members of the federal union, and have the same rights of
                    sovereignty, freedom and independence, as the other states."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Along with the struggle to establish a public domain, which proceeded by fits and starts until the

                    </placeName>'s claims in 1784 provided a crowning success, the Confederation Congress had
                    to consider several other influences in dealing with the West in the 1780s. Some of these were long
                    standing; others more immediate.</p>

                    the mountains would be a peculiar breed of semicivilized, barbarous individuals and families who had
                    long pioneered in the remote reaches of the forests. During the War of the Revolution the physical
                    presence and fighting services of these families were welcomed as buffers against the Indian menace
                    and the incursions of the Catholic French; in peace time their reputations were of a much different
                    kind. Then they were known for their irresponsibility in economic matters, especially for fleeing
                    debts and ignoring tax agents, for defying the collector of quit rents, for trespassing on private
                    lands without payment or apology, for collectively defying the law and the courts, for disdaining
                    the church and other "civilizing" influences. In the eyes of responsible,
                    sober-minded observers, these people were barbarous and uncivilized. The most common analogy was to
                    the Indian tribes with whom they shared the forest domain.</p>
            <p>It was these frontier people who formed the cast of characters in Conrad Richter's novel,
                        <hi rend="i">The Trees.</hi> Richter's characters called themselves
                    "woodsies," and their presence and character are important, for the Ordinance of
                    1787 had to come to terms with them. Of course, there would be appointed officials with great
                    authority; but these frontier people would form the basis of the society that would emerge in the
                    Old Northwest, and provision must be made to bring them by stages along the road to civilization and
                    responsibility. And presumably by the time of statehood this first generation of frontier people
                    would have recognized and come to respect the law and order in society, or alternatively, they would
                    have been replaced by subsequent generations who would have these desirable characteristics.</p>
            <p>To the character of the people in the West must be added the need to make provision for the orderly
                    disposal of the new public domain and to do it before the pressure of population across the
                    mountains became so large that it could not be controlled and directed. George <placeName>

                    the Government of the Territory of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    </placeName>." Richard Henry Lee announced the adoption of the Northwest Ordinance to
                    George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> with an explicit reference to the connection between the two when he wrote that the
                    Ordinance was enacted "preparatory to the sale of the lands. It seemed necessary, for the
                    security of property among uninformed, and perhaps licentious people as the greater part of those
                    who go to there are, that a strong toned government should exist, and the rights of property be
                    clearly defined."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a third consideration. The economic condition of the new, independent nation was weak. The
                    states were struggling under substantial debts and burdened in many places by the spreading disease
                    of paper money. The national government was without funds and without prospects except for the asset
                    of the new public domain. This weakened financial condition helped to shape the time of the passage
                    of the ordinances. Suffice it to say that the Congress of the Confederation had to keep two separate
                    objects in mind: orderly provisions must be made for the sale of these public lands in order to
                    realize a substantial revenue from them; and the public domain should be used to help shape a
                    responsible and orderly society.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the Congress of the Confederation proposed in the Northwest Ordinance was a colonial system that
                    raised awkward questions for a nation emerging from a colonial experience. But the colonial aspects
                    of the system, e.g., the supreme authority of the governor and the weak and long-delayed voice of
                    the elected legislature, were muted by a declaration of rights that preserved fundamental freedoms,
                    including trial by jury, noninterference with religion, the right to bail, habeas corpus, and no
                    cruel or unusual punishment. And finally, there was the ultimate prize: admission to the union of
                    states on the basis of equality.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>The specific provisions of the Northwest Ordinance relating to land and its distribution influenced
                    the nature of the emerging western society and was in turn influenced by it. The first paragraph of
                    the Ordinance was significant in this regard: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Be it ordained by the authority aforesaid, that the estates both of resident and non resident
                            proprietors in the said territory dying intestate shall descend to and be distributed among
                            their children and the descendants of a deceased child in equal parts; the descendants of a
                            deceased child or grand child to take the share of their deceased parent in equal parts
                            among them; and where there shall be no children or descendants then in equal parts to the
                            next of kin in equal degree—and among collaterals the children of a deceased
                            brother or sister of the intestate shall have in equal parts among them their deceased
                            parents share [&amp; there shall in no case be a distinction between kindred of the

                  </p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>In this passage for "estate" read "land," for this was the most
                    common article of property that might be willed to heirs. The Ordinance, even before enumerating the
                    provisions of the government to be established (presumably its object), took up the question of the
                    inheritance of estates. And what is the judgment? That the estates should be divided equally among
                    all the children. The doctrine of primogeniture, the inheritance of the estate by the eldest in
                    order to preserve the estate as a single economic unit, this legal and social device (and it was
                    both) was ignored in favor of the doctrine of equality.</p>
            <p>Next, the framers of the Ordinance enumerated the officials who would exercise almost dictatorial
                    powers over the citizens of the new American empire—at least during the first formative
                    years before any kind of popular representation. To the appointed governor went powers worthy of any
                    British colonial administrator (whether in America, <placeName>
                        <country reg="at">Australia</country>
                    </placeName>, or <placeName>
                        <country reg="ii">India</country>
                    </placeName>): to rule by decree; to serve as commander of the militia and appoint other militia
                    officers up to and including the rank of colonel; to lay off counties and townships and appoint
                    necessary officials; and to play a leading role (with three appointed judges) in selecting and
                    publishing such laws as might fit the needs of the infant territory. And preceding this recitation
                    of authority and responsibility was a statement of the governor's new position as landed
                    aristocrat: "he shall reside in the district and have a free-hold estate therein, in one
                    thousand acres of land while in the exercise of this office." For the secretary and the
                    three territorial judges the freehold estate would be five hundred acres under the same terms and
                        circumstances.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The provisions for these landed estates were pointed reminders of the connection between a
                    "freehold estate" and political and economic power. Here, as elsewhere in the
                    American nation, land would symbolize the political, economic, and social standing of the <list type="footnotes">

                    life and property of the new western world, a landed estate to dilute the sense of an alien and
                    arbitrary appointee arrived among the local citizens to command them in imperial fashion; it would
                    provide a place where the governor could establish the kind of physical presence that would lend
                    honor and authority to the office. And a thousand acres was a substantial estate in the view of the
                    members of the Congress of the Confederation, albeit scarcely a pin-point in the wilderness of the
                    Territory Northwest of the <placeName>

            <p>Other congressional actions at about the same time suggest both confusion and ambivalence about the
                    estates of the appointed officials of the Northwest Territory. While on the one hand Congress
                    endowed territorial officials with landed estates of five hundred and one thousand acres, with the
                    other it sold landed estates of one-and-one-half millions of acres to a corporate entity known as
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Company of Associates, another one-and-one-half million to the Scioto Company, and a
                    third sale of one million acres to a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName> entrepreneur named John Cleves Symmes. In taking such action the Congress intended to
                    fulfill another desirable quality of the Northwest Territory, namely to use its landed resources to
                    relieve the financial embarrassments of the national government. Thus, almost simultaneously, the
                    Northwest Ordinance gave its territorial officials a landed estate, and the officials found their
                    estates dwarfed by estates offered to giant land companies and individual land speculators.</p>
            <p>The sale of large tracts to land companies raised attendant issues that related to land in the

                    </placeName> Varnum, and John Cleves Symmes himself, had substantial connection with land companies,
                    so much so that in conjunction with the secretary, Winthrop Sargent, the territory was really ruled
                    by a landed oligarchy. An ironic twist of the relationship between political and judicial authority
                    on the one hand and land on the other was that the governor, Arthur St. Clair, who was to become the
                    symbol of authoritarian (even tyrannical) rule, was probably the only person of rank in the
                    territory who was not interested in estate building. As a military man and public
                    servant—he had served a term as president of the Congress of the
                    Confederation—he thought himself above such pedestrian money-grubbing activities. It is
                    curious that his model as public servant and military leader, General George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was actively involved in land speculation for many years. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> always thought of the West in the most practical terms: as a place to make a fortune in
                    land. St. Clair had a large landed estate in western <placeName>

            <p>Other political and economic leaders in the Northwest Territory did not share St. Clair's
                    indifference to land and landed estates. Whatever their views on representative government and on
                    executive and judicial authority, the most prominent political figures in the territory were large
                    landholders. Foremost among them was Thomas Worthington, late of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, who would become the leader of the opposition faction. Even as Worthington and St.
                    Clair clashed over issues of representation, republican values, economic development, and executive
                    authority, Worthington's large landed estate would sharply contrast with the
                    governor's spartan lifestyle.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>Another aspect of the Ordinance that
                    relates to the public domain was the issue of property qualifications for officeholders and voters.
                    The Ordinance laid out three stages from territory to statehood. In the first stage the appointed
                    governor ruled by decree. In the second stage, when the district had five thousand free male
                    inhabitants over the age of twenty-one (presumably a category to assess the militia under arms),
                    then "free male inhabitants… [might] elect representatives from their counties
                    or townships to represent them in the general assembly … ."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ordinance next established specific requirements for participation in this political process,
                    either as voter or as officeholder. The document read: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>provided that no person be eligible or qualified to act as a representative unless he shall
                            have been a citizen of one of the <placeName>
                                <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                            </placeName> three years and be a resident in the district or unless he shall have resided
                            in the district three years and in either case shall likewise hold in his own right in fee
                            simple two hundred acres of land within the same; provided also that a freehold in fifty
                            acres of land in the district… shall be necessary to qualify a man as an elector
                            of a representative.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> These requirements looked back to a widely held principle of the colonial period, namely,
                    that only property holders should stand for office and exercise the franchise, and the commonly
                    accepted form of property to establish eligibility for political participation in society was landed
                    property.</p>
            <p>The property requirement stamped the Northwest Ordinance as a traditional document, traditional in
                    the sense that it perpetuated landed property requirements of the colonial period. Although the
                    reasoning is not specific here, the drafters of the document might have been swayed by the widely
                    held views of the irresponsible character of the western people, those barbarians and savages (men
                    and women) who lived across the mountains in a state of nature. <list type="footnotes">

                    laws or courts or property, was not a recommendation to exercise the vote.</p>
            <p>The practical results of this property requirement were not clear, but such qualifications surely
                    reduced the numbers eligible to exercise the franchise, perhaps by as many as half. And aside from
                    the issue of whether the requirement was stringently enforced, there was always the question of how
                    the prospective voter came into possession of a freehold estate of fifty acres and could prove
                    possession in such a manner as to satisfy the law. In the Territory Northwest of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> settlers who proposed to purchase land might do so from one of the three private land
                    companies or from the national government under terms laid down in the Ordinance of 1785. Titles
                    from land companies were uncertain. This was especially so in the case of Symmes, a kind and
                    good-hearted man who nonetheless sold much land to which he did not have clear title. Congress
                    eventually passed a law to redress some of his worst lapses.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the case of the federal government the effective operation of the Ordinance of 1785, delayed at
                    best, required much additional tinkering before an orderly system evolved under which settlers might
                    find their way to a convenient land office and make practical arrangements under easily understood
                    rules that would bring them a clear title. And when Governor St. Clair finally permitted the
                    territory to move to the second stage of government, he had to modify the fifty-acre freehold
                    requirement, for many frontiersmen did not hold a clear title to their lands. In the end St. Clair
                    permitted adult males with town lots or houses worth fifty acres of land t o exercise the franchise,
                    but he upheld the principle of the Ordinance that property and the franchise went hand in hand.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>Finally, there was the question of the powers of the district, territory, and state (admitted under
                    the provisions of the Ordinance) over the public lands. The Ordinance was quite precise about this
                    question. After declaring that the legislature of the district might levy and collect taxes, the
                    text continued: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    government. Thus, new states had achieved a measure of political equality with the old under the
                    terms of the Ordinance, but even with statehood they were still at the mercy of the national
                    government in the disposal of their lands. In short, the new states lost the right to make vital
                    decisions about what might be a substantial portion of their own landed territory, areas that they
                    might have offered at a reduced price or simply given away in the interest of putting settlers on
                    the lands. This provision was a reaffirmation of the idea accepted as national policy, namely, that
                    the public lands were a great national resource the sale of which would alleviate present debts and
                    future expenditures. It was an attitude that persisted until well after the Civil War. The
                    provisions that prohibited the states and territories from taxing the public domain was a further
                    statement of this policy, one that enriched the nation at the expense of the new territory or state.
                    And, finally, the declaration that non-resident proprietors might be taxed at no higher rate than
                    residents confirmed the public domain as an investment for distant entrepreneurs.</p>
            <p>Taken together, these principles severely handicapped some of the first public land states such as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName> where settlement was exceptionally slow because of their physical isolation off the
                    routes of immigration and the greater attraction of public lands elsewhere. And this issue assumed
                    something of a crisis proportion in the late nineteenth century, when the rise of the conservation
                    movement led to the establishment in several western states of vast public reserves that could not
                    be sold and, by thus restricting settlement and economic development, doomed these states to remain
                    only partially settled. The modern antecedents of the hostility to this provision are alive in the
                    "sage brush rebellion," a movement for the cession of the public land reserves to
                    the states wherein they lie or, at the very least, the opening of these reserves for economic
                        development.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But these results lay in the future. In expectations and realities the Ordinance of 1787 (taken in
                    conjunction with the Ordinance of 1785) opened opportunities for a "freehold
                    estate" or economic opportunity to both settlers and speculators. Numerous families of this
                    first generation of American independence pursued the "freehold estate" with the
                    same intensity as had their parents and grandparents as the avenue to economic independence and
                    social advantage. Later, their children would search for lands in <placeName>

                    </placeName> offered a variety of terms and a wide range of settings. There were three land

                    </placeName>) was a museum of schemes for land distribution. What the Northwest Ordinance gave to
                    those settlers who wished to purchase was the assurance of a stable and orderly government, with
                    townships and counties, set in the context of guarantees of certain fundamental rights such as
                    habeas corpus and trial by jury. Finally, the provision for admission to the Union on the basis of
                    equality meant that settlers would not be part of a permanent colonial system-although those who
                    lived in the territories of <placeName>

                    status was a well-nigh permanent one.</p>
            <p>To speculators the Ordinance offered assurances through legal institutions for the safety of their
                    investment and the prospect of security and growth to the settlers who purchased from them. For the
                    entrepreneurs the western country in 1787 must have seemed a golden opportunity. When the American
                    government had made good its claims of sovereignty against the English and quieted Indian claims,
                    the opportunities for judicious investment stretched forth on every hand. For this group the
                    "freehold estate" was an opportunity to make a fortune through investment. The
                    Ordinance was a mark of government support in their enterprises. Beyond settlers and speculators a
                    third group demands attention. The American Indian might have found in the Ordinance a firebell in
                    the night (to borrow Thomas Jefferson's phrase), for this document represented a statement
                    of cultural confidence that assumed that the Indians would be brushed aside. In the aftermath of the
                    American Revolution the Native Americans now found themselves enmeshed in the world of American
                    legal doctrines. True, the Ordinance declared in its third article: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>the utmost good faith shall always be observed towards the Indians; their land and property
                            shall never be taken from them without their consent; and in their property, rights and
                            liberty, they never shall be invaded or disturbed, unless in just and lawful wars authorised
                            by Congress; but laws founded in justice and humanity shall from time to time be made, for

                    </quote> Yet the future outlined for them was a chilling one. The Ordinance was a blueprint for an

                    unroll from east to west. Indeed, the Ordinance was based on the premise of Anglo-American
                    settlement in the interior of the continent. Whatever the pious declarations of the Ordinance, the
                    assumptions were plainly laid out: it was that Americans would take the land and organize it
                    according to the model described therein for the benefit of its citizens.</p>
            <p>In looking forward from 1787 through the nineteenth century and into the twentieth at the
                    relationship of the Northwest Ordinance to the public domain and the expansion of the American
                    continental empire, two separate questions attract attention. The first is the influence of land and
                    land titles in territories with substantial foreign antecedents. It is striking how many of these
                    there are. For the first half of the nineteenth century <placeName>

                    grants, to balance justice against the clear examples of human greed, to try to bridge the confusion
                    of different cultural and alien legal systems (in the case of the French and Spanish). In the Far
                    West in the period after the Civil War, the territory of <placeName>

                    </placeName> was especially noteworthy for the systematic looting of its lands by public officials.
                    This story is a reminder that the Ordinance became the law of the land for a variety of
                    non-Anglo-American peoples, who had not read or who did not subscribe to the doctrines of Sir
                    William Blackstone.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>In the final analysis the Northwest Ordinance established the ground rules for an American empire in
                    the West. It was an empire based on land: land seized from the Indians, surveyed, and parcelled out
                    to the citizens of the Republic, that they might learn responsibility through land ownership, that
                    they might participate in the political process, that they might continue the search for a
                    "freehold estate" that had occupied so much of their time since the opening of the

            <p>The Northwest ordinances have long been regarded as the founding documents of public education in the
                    Old Northwest. Two clauses account for this reputation, one in the 1785 ordinance and the other in
                    the 1787 ordinance. The fist specified the ways in which the settlers should support education, and
                    the second defined the purposes of education in a republic. The 1785 ordinance declared that one
                    section in each township had to be set aside for the support of public schools. The land was to be
                    rented to a settler, and the proceeds used to pay for schools. (Thus, the school lands were not
                    necessarily the land on which the school was built.) The 1787 ordinance reinforced that commitment
                    to education by including the now-famous clause explaining the purposes of education in the new
                    territory: "Religion, morality and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the
                    happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These clauses have a time-honored place in books about the history of education. Ellwood P.
                    Cubberley's immensely popular 1919 textbook quotes the 1787 clause and then explains:

                    "These gifts by Congress… of national lands for the endowment of public
                    education, though begun in large part as a land-selling proposition, helped greatly in the early

            <p>When historians got down to the ground level and examined how the settlers managed the school lands,
                    however, they found that the system did not work very well. Consequently, alongside the adoring
                    references to the ordinances as the cornerstone of public education are seemingly contradictory
                    accounts about their failure. There were several problems with the school land system. In an area of
                    abundant cheap land there were few customers for rental property. At the outset the land was
                    unimproved, so it was often rented at no charge simply on the agreement that the occupant would
                    improve the land over the years. For example, a contract for the school land in Ames, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1801 specified that Hugh Boyle would have the land rent free for seven years on
                    condition that he clear eighteen acres, including some for orchard, some for meadow, and some for
                        pasture.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Such arrangements were often poorly enforced; much of the land
                    went unrented; and territorial legislatures pressed Congress for permission to sell school lands
                    instead of renting them. Congress granted such permission in 1826, but this procedure did not work
                    much better than the rental system. Often the lands sold very cheaply, and the modest profits
                    languished in state school funds that were prone to collapse in economic crises. These funds were
                    also vulnerable to fraud and diversion, which occurred frequently in a region where people were
                    starved for investment capital and eager to construct expensive canals and railroads.</p>
            <p>As the echoes of the Northwest Ordinance's ringing statement about education became fainter,
                    school advocates realized that the modest funds from the school lands would have little impact on
                    local schools. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> the legislature sold the school lands to the existing tenants at cheap rates and
                    frequently forgave towns found guilty of misappropriating school funds. The exasperated state
                    auditor said in 1843, "There seems to be no end to the plunder upon this fund."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> A history of the school land grants written in 1885 cites embezzlements, hasty

                    big story of the Northwest ordinances' education policy is one of continual neglect and
                    misappropriation.</p>
            <p>Thus the story begins with a seeming paradox: the education provisions of the Northwest ordinances
                    were immensely important but had almost no effect on education in the Old Northwest. Traditional
                    historians of education have argued in considerable detail, on the one hand, that the ideas of the
                    Northwest ordinances provided the impetus for public education in the region and, on the other hand,
                    that the particular system of support through school lands was bedeviled by indifference, fraud, and
                    delay.</p>
            <p>When writing about education and the Northwest ordinances, recent historians have reacted variously
                    to these contrasting themes. Some, like Dennis Denenberg, writing in 1979, ignore the difficulties
                    with the school lands and merely assert that the ordinances were immensely important and effective.
                    Citing a 1916 textbook, Denenberg endorses the view that because of the North-west ordinances
                    "no other newly occupied country in the whole world's history has ever seen
                    schools established so nearly coincident to the first settlements, nor schools of so high an order
                    in so short a time."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A more accurate and sophisticated view, one that could be called neotraditional, is held by David
                    Tyack, Thomas James, and Aaron Benavot, who emphasize that Congress attempted to use land grants to
                    support common public schools throughout the nineteenth century. Whether the system was effective or
                    not in the early national period, Congress continued to use such leverage to try to persuade new
                    states to provide elementary education. This common tactic reflected a consensus for widespread
                    education that found its way into state constitutions. There were endless disagreements over <hi rend="i">how</hi> public schools should be provided, "but," say Tyack, James,
                    and Benavot, "on the value of diffusing knowledge through public schools there was
                    substantial agreement… ."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Tyack also emphasizes that after
                    the Civil War the new territories of the Far West implemented the same system with a good deal more
                    effectiveness, receiving as much as 10 percent of their local school monies from land-grant
                        funds.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> And surely a similar land-grant tactic worked even more successfully
                    with the land-grant colleges.</p>

            <p>Another historical point of view is provided by social historians, who try to get beyond the rhetoric
                    of the ordinances to discover what kind of education was actually provided by families, local
                    communities, and churches during the first three generations of settlement, when the land ordinances
                    and other state efforts had very little effect. They turn to local records and memoirs to try to
                    find out what schools were like, how they were supported, what was taught, and what the local
                    participants thought about them.</p>
            <p>There are, then, two histories of education in the Old North-west, one about the gradual development
                    of laws that provided free schools—that is, the political history of
                    education—and the other about the actual education of children during the seventy years
                    or so that passed without free public schools—that is, the social history of education. I
                    would like to illustrate these two histories by looking briefly at six people who were involved in
                    common school education, three advocates of state action and three teachers.</p>
            <p>Manasseh Cutler of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> was a founder of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Company and its main agent to Congress in 1787. In the 1785 land ordinance proposed by
                    Jefferson, Congress had already established the system of orderly, rectangular townships, with one
                    section reserved for the support of education. This occurred before Cutler got involved, but the New
                    Englander is widely credited with the statement about the purposes of education in the 1787
                    ordinance. Some historians view the education provisions of the Northwest ordinances as mere sales
                    features, thrown in to attract potential buyers by a Congress eager to sell federal lands on the
                    frontier, but Cutler illustrates the way in which those commercial motives were woven together with
                    concerns about how to recreate republican society on the frontier. In addition to his activities on
                    behalf of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Company, Cutler was a minister, a schoolteacher, a physician, and an amateur botanist.
                    He was a capitalist and a scholar, a land speculator and a renaissance man, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>'s answer to Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It is fair to say that the education clause was not mere window dressing to Cutler; he
                    was not just a land speculator but also the keeper of a n academy for boys in Ipswich, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, and a n assiduous member of the town's school inspection committee. As such,
                    he was minutely involved in the evaluation of textbooks and the examination of teachers.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not surprising, then, that Cutler, like Jefferson, saw an important role for education in the
                    orderly settlement of the West and in the transplanting of republican politics across the
                    Appalachians. One could not just send people into the wilderness; one had to send institutions, a
                    government, a plan. As Cutler explained in <list type="footnotes">

                    rather than the fear of punishment."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> As a scientist, Cutler also said
                    that he welcomed "the opportunity of opening a new and unexplored region for the range of
                    natural history, botany, and the medical science … ."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cutler embodies two tensions. First, the quest for private gain through speculation could conflict
                    with the public interest in an expanding republic. Like many leaders of territorial expansion,
                    however, Cutler saw private gain and the public interest as complementary. The leading landholders
                    would serve the public interest by developing the region and by establishing necessary institutions.
                    Second, Cutler's educational thought contained the contrasting ideals of liberty and order.
                    Nonetheless, like many educational leaders of the Revolutionary generation, Cutler saw discipline
                    and knowledge as prerequisites for virtue, and he believed that republicanism could only work in a
                    nation of virtuous citizens. Although easterners shared a negative image of the brutalizing
                    tendencies of the frontier, they also expressed, in theory at least, the optimistic vision of an
                    unspoiled civilization starting over again in a new environment. Thus, Cutler ventured,
                    "there will be an advantage which no other part of the earth can boast, and which probably
                    will never occur again; that, in order to begin <hi rend="i">right,</hi> there will be no <hi rend="i">wrong</hi> habits to combat, and no inveterate systems to overturn—there is
                    no rubbish to remove before laying the foundation.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Thus, it was extremely
                    important to leap in and educate youth properly from the start.</p>
            <p>It is interesting that Jefferson shares credit with Cutler for the education policy of the Northwest
                    ordinances—Jefferson for creating the school lands and Cutler for stating the purposes of
                    education—because, of course, although their politics differed in other regards, both men
                    were prominent supporters of state involvement in common school education. Neither in
                    Jefferson's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> nor in Cutler's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, however, did state school systems gain much support in legislatures or among the
                    public in the early national period. Nowhere in the East were common schools entirely free from
                    tuition charges, and nowhere did state governments regulate local public schools. Thus, although the
                    Northwest ordinances' school land scheme was based on the old English idea of devoting land
                    rents to educational purposes, it was quite innovative in the context <list type="footnotes">

                    then, schools sprang up through local initiative, without dependence on any proceeds from the school
                    lands.</p>
            <p>But not all communities had an Ephraim Cutler, or available schoolteachers, or sufficient population
                    to support a school; and when Cutler joined with others to try to press school development
                    throughout the territory, he ran into an endless string of obstacles. At first he was appointed one
                    of seven commissioners of the school lands in the whole territory. These men started optimistically
                    enough but found that rental arrangements were very irregular from one town to the next, and, in any
                    case, profits were insufficient for any substantial support of common schools. By 1818 Ephraim
                    Cutler was on a committee in the state legislature to devise a general school system, but efforts at
                    reform resulted only in an ineffective, non-mandatory bill for common schools in 1821. Although
                    there was resistance to taxation of individual property, reformers decided they had to move in that
                    direction because, as Rufus <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Putnam</settlement>
                    </placeName> wrote to Cutler in 1822, it had "been said again and again, that these public
                    [school] lands were of no real value, that the time expended in legislating upon them cost the state
                    more than they were worth."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Caleb Atwater complained that
                    "scarcely a dollar" had been generated for schools, and an 1824 report to the
                    legislature called the land-renting scheme "wholly unavailing."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> After working to get a general property tax plan through the legislature in 1824, Cutler
                    and Nathan Guilford managed to get a mandatory school law passed in 1825. It was imperfect and weak,
                    but a start. Twenty-three years had elapsed since Ephraim Cutler had inserted his father's
                    words about education into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s first constitution. Standing next to Guilford in the legislature after the
                    passage of the 1825 law, Cutler said, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,
                    according to thy word, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation."<hi rend="sup">21</hi> But
                    even this law had loopholes and went largely unenforced. It remained for reformers in the 1830s,
                    1840s, and 1850s to construct state laws that actually guaranteed the establishment of public
                    schools in every part of the state.</p>
            <p>The fate of the school land system was similar in other states of the territory, and legislation
                    designed to create state systems of schools followed a similar pattern everywhere. First, there were

            <p>Caleb Mills of Indiana belongs to the generation of school reformers who forged these first state
                    systems by persuading their legislatures to adopt mandatory property taxation for free common
                    schooling and to appoint state school superintendents to recommend legislation and monitor
                    educational developments. Like many of the school reformers of the 1840s, Mills was a minister by
                    training, a New Englander by birth, and a Whig in politics. He was first sent to the West as a
                    missionary for the American Sunday School Union. He moved to Indiana in 1833 and became professor of
                    languages and head of the normal school at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His campaign for an improved common school bill in Indiana began in 1846 when he wrote
                    an open letter to the legislature bemoaning the high rate of illiteracy in the state and urging
                    Indiana to adopt a tax-based free school system like those in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, which he held up as models. How much had Indiana taxed its people for schools, Mills
                    asked; and he answered his own question, "I will state it in <hi rend="i">round</hi>
                    numbers, $0.000.00." <hi rend="sup">23</hi> There was resistance elsewhere to
                    taxation for schooling, he argued, but legislatures went ahead anyway. If they waited for a
                    "harmony of views and sentiments" among the voters, he said, they "would
                    never effect anything great and noble." <hi rend="sup">24</hi> Mills's letter was
                    sent anonymously; he signed it only as "One of the People." Published in the
                    newspapers at the same time that it was delivered to the legislature, the letter received much
                    attention, but it got no immediate concrete results. Consequently, Mills submitted another anonymous
                    letter the next year. In the meantime, activists in the cause of education began to hold annual
                    conventions, which also pressured the legislature. The next General Assembly responded by putting
                    the question to the people of the state in a referendum. About 56 percent of the voters favored a
                    free school system. In 1848, in his third message to the legislature, Mills argued that many of the
                    negative votes came from areas where residents were below the general average in adult literacy and
                    thus probably did not understand the issue very well. This argument was typical of free-school <list type="footnotes">

                    ignorant or mean-spirited. Textbook writers took up this theme in the early twentieth century,
                    portraying opponents of school reform in the 1840s and 1850s as selfish, bigoted, and undemocratic.
                    Recently, however, a somewhat more sympathetic view of the opponents to free public schools has
                    emerged. Some of the opposition may have resulted from simple unwillingness to pay taxes, but it
                    must be remembered that most people at the time considered education to be the responsibility of
                    parents, churches, and local town meetings. There was some opposition in principle to central
                    authority. State-regulated, free public school systems did cost something in terms of diversity and
                    local control, and some people in the nineteenth century could see it coming. (Personally, I believe
                    that it was worth the price, on balance; but to read present-day policy preferences backward in time
                    and to take sides in policy debates of over a century ago on the basis of today's values is
                    to risk misunderstanding what was going on.)</p>
            <p>The Indiana legislature responded to the narrow referendum victory for common schools with another
                    weak law in 1849. Then, in 1852, after some more prodding by Mills and yet another statewide
                    referendum, as well as a new constitution that mandated attention t o education, legislators
                    expanded and bolstered the education law, finally providing free schools supported by taxes and
                    supervised by a state superintendent of schools. Mills even served as state superintendent of common
                    schools from 1854 to 1857, only to see the state supreme court rule in 1854 that the property tax
                    support for schools was unconstitutional. The taxing power was not restored until 1867. By then
                    Mills had retired from the field, leaving further system-building to younger men, while he built up
                    the library at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College. One wonders whether he often recalled the remark he made in a letter in 1833,
                    before he even moved to Indiana: "public sentiment must be changed in regard to free
                    schools… . Though it is the work of years, yet it must and can be done."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Mills's career demonstrates the difficulty in devising a system to

                    generations to overcome the pervasive resistance to state-sponsored schooling, and in this regard
                    the Old Northwest was no different from the Northeast. Anyone who believes that opposition to
                    publicly funded free schooling was found only among southerners and Catholics misunderstands the
                    origins of public education. The controversy also involved fights between localists and centralists,
                    between Democrats and Whigs, <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>, Sarah Pratt and her five sisters got enough education in the local schools to become
                    school-teachers themselves. Their parents, though of modest means, valued education. When Pratt was
                    twenty-five, she and her sister Susannah traveled to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> to spend some time with an older sister who had married and moved there. As it turned
                    out, Pratt spent a few years in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, teaching in neighborhood schools in order to support herself. She kept a diary, a
                    transcript of which is in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>

                    </placeName>. If one is interested in what went on inside district schoolhouses, one is struck by
                    how little Sarah Pratt said about it in her diary. She wrote matter-of-factly about school from day
                    to day—how many scholars showed up, when the weather interrupted, when inspectors
                    came—but she displayed no anxiety about school and rarely elaborated on the details of
                    her pedagogy or her relationships with students. She apparently took this part of her life for
                    granted and wrote with more fervor about religion, loneliness, and natural beauty. Schooling on the
                    frontier was a mundane activity, subject to cancellation due to the lack of a teacher, the illness
                    of a teacher, bad weather, parents' lack of money, or parents' need for their
                    children's labor—all of which Pratt recorded from time to time. She mentioned
                    with pleasure visits by parents or her sister at her school, said she kept an extra spelling school
                    after school or in the evening occasionally, and occasionally expressed her satisfaction with her
                    students, usually near the beginning or end of a term. "I have an excellent
                    school," she wrote in February, 1845. "They all strive to make me but little
                    trouble and the progress they are making in their studies is a satisfaction to me as well as to
                    their parents." <hi rend="sup">26</hi> In June of 1847 she admitted that she thought she
                    might be lonely in a new summer school situation with only twelve younger scholars: "I had
                    fancied myself much loneliness in the employment this summer in teaching a school so small and not
                    very far advanced in science. But I … think they progress fast and the anticipations that
                    I have of seeing them finely advanced at the close of the term are quite pleasing to me."

                    school as a sort of home, writing letters there before school would start. Her diary makes it clear
                    that she moved frequently and sometimes did not know on a given day where she would be staying the
                    next night. Nonetheless, except for the long distance she sometimes had to walk to school, she made
                    no complaints about the boarding arrangements.</p>
            <p>Pratt's diary includes names of individual students who were out occasionally for illness or
                    work. At one point no one showed up because of rain and mud; at another she dismissed her school
                    because most of the students were out picking strawberries.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Still, there were
                    two terms per year of several weeks each, one in summer and one in winter, and the attendance was

                    concerned, a person who took great pleasure in reading herself and worked hard to be a competent
                    teacher. In 1847 Sarah Pratt died in <placeName>

            <p>Mary Roper, another teacher who emigrated to the West, was part of an organized effort to civilize
                    the frontier through training and exporting young women from New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> to areas that needed district schoolteachers. Some residents of the Northwest welcomed
                    this effort; others resented and resisted it. Roper unfortunately ran into lots of the folks who
                    resisted. She was recruited and trained at <placeName>

                    Education Board, a missionary group founded by Catharine Beecher in the 1840s. In 1852 she was
                    assigned to Mill Point, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, a community of four hundred composed largely of immigrants who worked at a steam mill.
                    Roper wrote back to <placeName>

                    families possess influence but are bad men." The town was divided, it seems. Some wanted
                    another pious eastern teacher to replace the one they had had the previous year; but, commented
                    Roper, "the other party said ‘they had had a pious teacher long
                    enough… ." A rival school was begun, and, according to Roper, "a lady,
                    destitute of religious principle was hired to teach the children of the dissatisfied ones."
                    "No effort," she complained, "was left untried to injure my
                    school… . They cautiously circulated suspicions of my good character," then,
                    with more boldness, asserted "the most indecent stories." Furthermore, she stated,
                    "Attempts have been made repeatedly upon members of my school, to induce them to find fault
                    with school, and leave it for the other, but never have they in but one instance succeeded, and that
                    was the case of two Dutch [German] <list type="footnotes">

                    the school committee, and his efforts to fend off assaults on his own character. Nonetheless, she
                    said, "I am firmly attached to my scholars, and I think I can say that they are to

            <p>By June of the following year, however, things had taken a turn for the worse. Roper's
                    enrollment was down to half its original size, though the only fault she then said her opponents
                    attributed to her was that she loved her scholars too much and hit them too little. Still, the
                    opposition had become so "violent" that Mr. Smith decided not to hire her back,
                    and, on top of that, her strength had been sapped by the ague. She wrote to her sponsors in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hartford</settlement>
                    </placeName> for advice. <hi rend="sup">30</hi> They apparently told her to give up and return to
                    the East, because the next year, in July of 1854, she wrote from her home in Templeton, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, saying "my health is now reestablished and my desire to be active somewhere
                    brings home the question, where I can best labor?" She asked to be assigned again to the
                    West. <hi rend="sup">31</hi> Plucky and pious, Mary Roper was just what the National Popular
                    Education Board wanted, and perhaps her next assignment was more successful. Unfortunately, she
                    disappears from the record with this request that she be returned t o the frontier.</p>

                    </placeName>, Russel attended common schools in West Newton, Indiana, until she was fourteen. She
                    then enrolled a t higher schools in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Beech Grove</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Valley Mills, and the preparatory department of Earlham College. After a
                    year's teaching in Spring Valley, she taught a year in her home town of West Newton, where
                    her father was a school trustee. It was during this year, 1860--1861, that she kept a diary, a diary
                    that reveals much more about classroom practices than does Sarah Pratt's. Russel writes
                    about guest lecturers, about the games the children played, about grammar seminars after regular
                    school hours, about spelling bees, about parents at school exhibitions, and about her attempts to
                    maintain discipline without corporal punishment—one of the reforms women helped bring to
                    the district classrooms of America. Still, not all was harmony. One parent complained that <list type="footnotes">

                        part."<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Gentle discipline could have its ups and downs too. One
                    boy was "affronted" at something her assistant said, and another girl stalked out

            </p>
            <p>By the time Russel taught, in the late 1850s, public schooling was somewhat more organized than in
                    Pratt's day. Russel had to pass an examination to get a license. She recorded in her diary
                    that the night before her examination she studied grammar, geography, arithmetic, and spelling and
                    that her performance the next day was sufficient to qualify her for a two-year certificate. She had
                    state-approved textbooks, such as McGuffey's <hi rend="i">Reader, Webster's
                        Dictionary,</hi> and <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s <hi rend="i">Geography.</hi> The early trappings of professionalization show
                    up in her diary too. She subscribed to the <hi rend="i">Indiana School Journal,</hi> which in turn
                    recommended such professional books as <hi rend="i">The Teacher's Friend,</hi> which she
                    also read. And she was active in the local teachers' association, which met monthly and
                    discussed such matters as discipline.</p>
            <p>Russel had over sixty students, with an assistant to help while she listened to the recitations of
                    groups in rapid succession: the "abecedarians" (as the beginning readers were
                    called) and three higher reading groups, the four spelling classes, the grammar group, and three
                    arithmetic groups, some of them more than once a day, adding up to twenty-three recitation meetings.
                    Bible reading was also a regular part of her curriculum, although by 1860 many <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> schools in Indiana had given up their practice of bringing all the students to a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> morning meeting in the middle of the week. Attendance at midweek religious services had
                    been universal in many local schools organized in predominantly <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> communities by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> quarterly meetings earlier in the century. Even when they received public money, these
                    local, religious, quasi-public schools required all their students to attend midweek <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> meeting. The education law of 1834 explicitly recognized the legitimacy of state aid to
                    such schools, endorsing the early nineteenth century approach to common schooling—more
                    local, more diverse, without such a strong dividing line between public and private or between
                    religious and nonreligious schools. By the 1860s most of these schools were controlled by public
                    school trustees, and the practice of midweek services faded. But not the practice of Bible reading.
                    Caleb Mills said that "the Bible is too deeply enthroned in the hearts of the people, to be
                    excluded from our common schools."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> As Rebecca Russel said one Sunday

            <p>By 1860, then, Rebecca Russel's school was emerging from its distinctive <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> past and becoming part of the state network of public schools; it was funded partly by
                    tax money raised by the town and partly by tuition payments subscribed by parents. Attendance was
                    voluntary and control was largely local, but the school was being drawn into a rudimentary set of
                    state regulations with county-level supervision. Thus, by 1860, the two strands of the history of
                    education came together: the social history of local schooling came into real contact with the
                    system that resulted from the political struggle to create and supervise free public schools.
                    Seventy years after the Northwest ordinances the schemes of the educational reformers and the
                    conduct of local schools began to intertwine.</p>
            <p>What does the experience of these six people reveal about education in the Old Northwest? First, if
                    historians of education are interested in how children got educated, they must move behind the
                    political scene to the local level, where much education was going on that was neither inspired nor
                    supported by the state. Second, because schooling was locally initiated and unregulated, it was very
                    uneven. In some communities sparse population, poor resources, lack of leadership, or general
                    indifference led to meager provision for schools. Elsewhere, local school development was quite
                    impressive long before the state got into the act. Third, because the lines between public and
                    private and between church and state were fuzzy, both in funding arrangements and in content, local
                    schooling was quite diverse. All schools taught the three R's, but districts differed
                    drastically, not only in the length of school terms, the qualifications of teachers, the quality of
                    schoolhouses, and the number of students in the district school and in whether men or women were
                    hired, but also in the treatment of religion and even in the use of foreign languages for
                    instruction.</p>
            <p>This diversity, unevenness, and lack of state supervision was not what had been envisioned by the
                    education advocates of the 1790s—Jefferson or Cutler, for example—but it was
                    what a majority of the people wanted. Local citizens fought to retain this unregulated diversity up
                    through the 1840s and 1850s. Only then did the balance tip toward the advocates of regulation, state
                    involvement, and fully tax-supported common schools. Because the Northwest ordinances provided some
                    stirring language and a stab at systematic public support of schools, people often think that they
                    laid down <list type="footnotes">

                    in a way, they did. The ordinances stated an ideal of education for orderly progress and responsible
                    liberty, an ideal that presumed an activist government promoting popular education; they also
                    provided a modicum of support through land grants, a system that reformers could bemoan, react
                    against, and strive to improve.But the creation of state-regulated, free, public schools awaited
                    more than a half-century of political and cultural developments, not just on the frontier but in the
                    East as well. School supporters had to overcome opponents' indifference, parsimony, and
                    preoccupation with other priorities; they also had to overcome much principled opposition to
                    taxation and state regulation. Consensus about the value of universal elementary education was there
                    from the beginning. Consensus about the state's role had to be built. By 1860 a majority of
                    Americans favored a single, tax-supported, free school system, and this belief is one of the
                    enduring legacies of the nineteenth century. But the sources of dissent continued; thus, the
                    dialogue continues, even in our own day.</p>

            <p>Fifty-two years before Congress enacted the Northwest Ordinance, the British government excluded
                    slaves from the colony of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Although this precedent has been conspicuously ignored in debates
                    over the meaning of Article VI of the Northwest Ordinance, the parallels are intriguing. In both
                    cases the prohibition of slavery was adopted as part of a separate legislative act and not
                    incorporated in a founding charter or national Constitution. While the intentions of the
                    Confederation Congress are more obscure than those of James Oglethorpe and the trustees of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, it is clear that neither measure was expected to endanger slavery in adjacent
                    territories or challenge the legitimacy of slaveholding in general. The 1735 prohibition allowed
                    Carolinians to reclaim blacks who escaped into <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, just as Article VI provided for the return of fugitives "to the person
                    claiming his or her labor or service."</p>
            <p>The advocates of a free-soil <placeName>

                    </placeName> were anything but abolitionists. Oglethorpe was deputy governor of the slave-trading
                    Royal African Company and also owned slaves on a Carolina plantation. The prohibition act provided
                    for the sale of any unclaimed blacks found in the colony. The trustees were to receive the proceeds.
                    In 1787, as far as is known, no southern members of the Congress of the Confederation voiced the
                    slightest disapproval of Article VI, which a committee of five, including a South Carolinian and two
                    Virginians, suddenly added a t the last minute to the finished text of the Northwest Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Staughton Lynd and Paul Finkelman, in their masterly studies of Article VI, have underscored the

                    in the House of Representatives. A few northerners objected that allowing representation for slaves
                    would encourage further slave importation from Africa. Delegates from <placeName>

                    </placeName> demanded constitutional protection for slavery as the price for union. Subsequent
                    conflicts in the convention and in the First Congress under the new Constitution showed how
                    explosive the South would become in the face of any perceived threat to its most valuable form of
                    property. Yet on July 13, the day after the Constitutional Convention provisionally accepted the
                    three-fifths compromise, the Continental Congress, chaired by a southerner, adopted the Northwest
                    Ordinance with its newly added Article VI, which had not appeared in the draft of July 11. A
                    northerner cast the single dissenting vote. When the First Congress reenacted the Ordinance in 1789,
                    the southerners who would soon become so outraged by cautiously worded antislavery petitions seem
                    not to have sensed an abolitionist Trojan Horse or entering wedge.</p>
            <p>Parallels between the slavery exclusions of 1735 and 1787 extend beyond slaveholder concurrence. Both
                    the British and American governments hoped to attract enterprising white migrants who would rapidly
                    settle a territory that reached toward a Spanish frontier. Some of the planners, at least, sought
                    white settlers from a social class that could not afford to buy slaves—settlers who, as
                    experience had shown, had been deterred from emigrating to the more prosperous plantation regions.
                    Oglethorpe and his philanthropic supporters were thinking of British debtors and German peasants who
                    could contribute to imperial self-sufficiency by producing such commodities as silk and wine. The
                    later American developers were thinking of a less debased class of yeoman farmers who would clear
                    the land of Indians and trees, cultivate grains, build roads, towns, churches, and schools, and
                    eventually be capable of self-government. Despite this difference, both blueprints envisioned a
                    fusion of individual opportunity and national interest that depended on maintaining the dignity of
                    physical labor. One of <list type="footnotes">

                    period of settlement, was the fear that whites would be demoralized and corrupted by the presence of
                    black slave competitors.</p>
            <p>Far more important, in the case of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, was the need for a secure buffer zone between <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The British were alarmed by the Spaniards' success in encouraging black
                    resistance in Carolina and offering a refuge for fugitive slaves. This anxiety deepened when
                    Oglethorpe failed to capture St. Augustine and when the slave unrest exploded in the Stono
                    Rebellion. The Spanish borderlands had a different but no less significant bearing on the Northwest
                    Ordinance. Robert V. Remini, in his inaugural address to this conference, has graphically described
                    the dangers of the mid-l780s, when southwestern settlers were prepared to transfer their allegiance
                    to <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> if Congress refused to recognize their vital need for water transport to the Gulf of

                    </placeName> the right to free navigation of the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>. Whatever
                    tradeoffs led to the acceptance of Article VI, it seems likely that southerners expected the bargain
                    to quiet most northern opposition to rapid westward expansion, including the demand for access to
                    the <placeName>

                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> soon discovered, an act prohibiting slavery is not self-enforcing. In 1735 slavery was
                    universally sanctioned by the law of nations, and black slaves were openly sold and traded in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> as well as in every New World colony. Petitions from white settlers in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, including illiterates who could not sign their names, predicted that the colony would
                    sink into ruin unless quickly supplied with black slaves. A few antislavery petitioners spoke of the
                    Africans' natural right to freedom. They also argued that slaves would deprive white
                    laborers and craftsmen of work and endanger the colony with bloody insurrections. But meanwhile, no
                    institutions were effective in preventing Carolina planters from crossing the Savannah River with
                    their slaves or even slave ships from landing their cargoes in Savannah. In 1749 the trustees
                    finally capitulated and asked Parliament to repeal the prohibition.</p>
            <p>Paul Finkelman has recently analyzed the ambiguities of the Northwest Ordinance with respect to
                    slavery and has emphasized the failure of Congress to enact any enforcement legislation. As early as
                    July, 1788, the Franco-American slaveholders residing in the territory petitioned Congress to secure
                    their slave property from the effects of what they considered an "Ex post facto
                    law" that seemed to violate the terms of the Treaty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> of 1763 and the <placeName>

                    </placeName> land cession of 1784. Like some of the earlier Georgian petitioners, the French
                    settlers contended that the obnoxious law would depopulate parts of the territory. And, in
                    actuality, some of <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-084-1-082"/> the more affluent French slaveholders sought
                    security in the Spanish territory across the <placeName>

                    Northwest before 1787, Finkelman points out that the report of a three-member congressional

                    the same reassuring message to the inhabitants of the territory; namely, that Article VI pertained
                    to the future introduction of slaves and was not intended to deprive present inhabitants of property
                    they possessed at the time the Ordinance was passed. As Finkelman and other historians have shown,
                    settlers continued to petition Congress to repeal or modify Article VI, while the territorial
                    governments of Indiana and <placeName>

                    </placeName> tried to attract slaveholders by giving sanction to various forms of involuntary
                    servitude. Until the well-known electoral struggle of 1823-1824, there was a genuine possibility
                    that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> would become a slave state. As in colonial <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, the issue turned on local conditions and demography. Fortunately, the Northwest was
                    not adjacent to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Atlantic. From Finkelman's forceful arguments it might well be
                    concluded that the Northwest Ordinance was no more significant as an antislavery measure than the
                    British law of 1735 "for rendering the Colony of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> more Defencible."</p>
            <p>But such a verdict would ignore the extraordinary power of antislavery ideology, which must be
                    distinguished from Garrisonian immediatism. The principle that slavery should be excluded from the
                    virgin West became the core of an antislavery and Republican party ideology that obscured the
                    economic benefits of coerced labor and transformed the moral meaning of national interest. To
                    develop this point I must first review recent reevaluations of slavery as part of a global
                    capitalist economy. I will then turn to the misapprehensions that arise when immediatist standards
                    and expectations are imposed on such measures as the Northwest Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Historians have only begun to free themselves from the antislavery assumptions that permeated
                    political economy from the time of Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Adam Smith. They still find it difficult to believe that an immoral and flagrantly
                    unjust system of labor could be congruent with long-term economic and material progress. They
                    intuitively reject the claims of Robert W. Fogel and other economists that slave labor was
                    efficient, productive, adaptable, and immensely profitable. Whatever the short-term rewards, in the
                    moral economy of history the sin of slaveholding surely led to soil exhaustion, indebtedness,

                    But this conventional imagery merges many independent variables and confuses the symptoms of an
                    imbalanced economy with economic decline. It also obscures the crucial contributions of black slaves
                    to the growth of a larger, interdependent Atlantic economy. The recent research of David Eltis,
                    Seymour Drescher, Stanley Engerman, Rebecca J. Scott, and other scholars has moved beyond the now
                    conventional view that black slave labor provided the foundation for the wealthiest and most dynamic
                    New World economies before 1800; there is now impressive evidence that the economic importance of
                    slavery <hi rend="i">increased</hi> in the nineteenth century along with the soaring global demand
                    for such consumer goods as sugar, coffee, and cotton textiles. This demand could only be met by
                    plantation production and coerced labor, including the hundreds of thousands of indentured Asian
                    workers who eventually replaced many of the emancipated West Indian blacks.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Contrary to traditional dogma, under most circumstances free labor was not cheaper or more productive
                    than slave labor. In most of the New World, in any event, a sufficient supply of free labor was
                    never available. And as the British learned to their dismay after emancipating nearly 800,000
                    colonial slaves, free laborers were unwilling to accept the plantation discipline and working
                    conditions that made sugar production a highly profitable investment. The British West Indian
                    colonies did not decline in their value to the British economy until the 1820s, when the effects of
                    slave-trade abolition finally began to counteract rising worker productivity. Britain's
                    suicidal, or as Drescher would have it, "econocidal" destruction of the
                    world's leading producers of sugar and coffee provided an extra stimulus to the plantations

                        Trade,</hi> finds a symbiotic relationship between New World slavery and industrial capitalism.
                    Slave labor produced most of the first luxury goods that reached a mass consumer market,
                    particularly in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, and that therefore contributed to the labor incentives needed for English industrial
                    work discipline. The dramatic drop in price for British manufactured goods reduced the cost of
                    buying slaves on the African coast. While the price of slaves remained low and relatively stable in
                    Africa during much of the nineteenth century, the price of slaves continued to rise in the New
                    World, with minor fluctuations, as landowners sought to meet the mounting world demand for sugar,
                    coffee, cocoa, tobacco, rice, and cotton. As Eltis convincingly argues, "for the Americas
                    as well as for Britain at the outset of industrialization, there was a profound incompatibility
                    between economic self-interest and antislavery policy."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite Britain's vigorous and expensive efforts to suppress the Atlantic slave trade,
                    approximately two-and-one-quarter million African slaves were imported into the Americas between
                    1811 and 1860. As Eltis has shown, it was not until the 1840s, a decade of massive European
                    migration to the Americas, that the flow of free immigrants exceeded the flow of African slaves,
                    even though the importation of slaves was by then almost entirely confined to <placeName>
                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> The symbiosis between slavery and industrial capitalism is
                    perhaps most vividly indicated by the fact that the illicit Atlantic slave trade depended on British
                    capital, credit, insurance, and the manufactured goods, including firearms, that were exchanged in
                    Africa for slaves.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One concludes from Eltis's iconoclastic study that British capitalism, as a source of human
                    exploitation and suffering in the early industrial era, could have been even worse than it proved to
                    be. Economic growth would probably have increased a t a faster rate if Britain had not outlawed the
                    slave trade and curbed the development of the rich plantation lands in Trinidad and <placeName>

                    that Eltis's neoclassical economic analysis exposes the pathological consequences of a
                    world view that subordinates all human relationships to free-market choices and the supreme goal of
                    achieving the largest national product.</p>
            <p>But when the vitality and flexibility of nineteenth century slavery are considered, the exclusion of
                    the institution from any territory seems all the more remarkable. Before 1787 the single attempt to
                    exclude slavery from a New World colony proved to be a hopeless failure. In 1790, when Britain
                    sought to encourage white immigration to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>

                    </placeName> and Bermuda, the Imperial Act allowed the introduction of black slaves as a matter of
                        course.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Britain failed to respect the French Convention's
                    emancipation decree of 1794, which applied to territories that fell under British control. In 1802
                    Napoleon restored slavery in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gp">Guadeloupe</country>
                    </placeName> and in the following year legalized both slavery and the slave trade. It is true that
                    when the North American colonies had earlier begun to resist British taxation and to assert their
                    own right to self-determination, they suspended or permanently prohibited the further importation of
                    slaves; but unlike the other plantation societies of the New World, the southern colonies could rely
                    on the rapid natural increase of their slave populations. Although the American Revolution
                    encouraged genuine moral misgivings over the justice of human slavery, the state laws suspending or
                    prohibiting the slave trade arose from a variety of motives. These included the desire of some
                    southerners to maintain high slave prices and to dominate labor markets in the West; the fear of
                    many northerners that slave competition would undermine the livelihood of white workers; and the
                    more widely shared conviction that the Republic's security and welfare required greater
                    racial homogeneity.</p>
            <p>Whatever the legacy of the Revolution, in 1787 slavery was supported by the laws of every state

            <p>When historians ponder the mystery of Article VI, they customarily quote a revealing passage from
                    William Grayson's letter of August 8, 1787, to James <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName>. Grayson, the Virginian who had presided over Congress when the Ordinance was approved,
                    explained, "The clause respecting slavery was agreed to by the Southern members for the
                    purpose of preventing Tobacco and Indigo from being made on the N.W. side of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> as well for sev'l other political reasons." While we have no reason
                    to doubt the accuracy of this report, aside from a mistake in copying "indigo"
                    instead of "hemp," it is not immediately clear why southerners feared competition
                    more from the Northwest than from the Southwest.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> In 1787 tobacco exports were
                    rising. If western expansion threatened to lower the price of certain slave-grown staples, it would
                    also raise the price of slaves and offer new opportunities to slaveholders who were willing to
                    migrate. It is true that Grayson and other Virginians had a personal interest in developing the
                    lands of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    </placeName> and that by 1787 many observers assumed the Northwest would be settled by New
                    Englanders. But the exclusion of slavery would still appear to be a costly surrender of principle,
                    especially for the Deep South.</p>
            <p>Representatives from the Deep South, who fought so bitterly to protect their constitutional right to
                    import slaves from Africa, might well have seen Article VI as a restriction that would limit the
                    future demand for slave labor and thus reinforce arguments for a constitutional or congressional
                    prohibition of the slave trade. On July 13 the Constitutional Convention had not yet faced the
                    extremely divisive question of the Atlantic slave trade, and of course no one could predict the
                    outcome of the Constitutional Convention or assume that a new constitution would be adopted.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> However one interprets the evidence, excluding slavery from such a n immense
                    territory appears to be a dangerous precedent and a drastic means either for limiting competition or
                    for the contradictory goal of ensuring that slavery could expand into the southwest. In any event,
                    the latter objective would be virtually guaranteed by the terms of the land cessions of the southern
                    seaboard states.</p>

            <p>It is possible, of course, that the southern congressmen never expected the prohibition to be
                    effective or permanent. Or Staughton Lynd may well be right when he offers the hypothesis of a
                    secret compromise in which southerners accepted Article VI as a low price for the three-fifths
                    clause and the fugitive slave clause in the federal Constitution.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> But
                    regardless of the varying views on this question, the intentions of the framers are of minor
                    significance when compared with the ideological consequences of creating free soil.</p>
            <p>An instructive analogy can be drawn between Article VI and Lord Mansfield's famed <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Somerset</settlement>
                    </placeName> decision of 1772. Like the Continental congressmen, Lord Mansfield had no intention of
                    endangering the institution of slavery. The question he faced was whether the law of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> allowed Charles Stuart, a resident Virginian, to seize his runaway slave, James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Somerset</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and lock him in chains aboard a ship scheduled to sail to <placeName>
                        <country reg="jm">Jamaica</country>
                    </placeName>. After granting a writ of <hi rend="i">habeas corpus,</hi> ordering the ship's
                    captain to bring <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Somerset</settlement>
                    </placeName> to court, Mansfield first sought an out-of-court settlement. Fearing the effects of a
                    judicial opinion on the status of ten thousand or more black slaves held in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, he advised resident planters to appeal to Parliament for appropriate legislation. In
                    an earlier trial Mansfield had announced, "I would have all masters think them free, and
                    all Negroes think they were not, because then they would both behave better." After hearing
                    the opposing arguments of counsel, which would either have legitimated or abolished slavery on
                    English soil, the chief justice searched for the narrowest possible ground on which to base his
                    decision. He affirmed that slavery must be based on positive law and could not be
                    "introduced by courts of justice upon mere reasoning or inferences from any principles,
                    natural or political." In discharging <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Somerset</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Mansfield went no farther than to say English law did not permit a master to seize his
                    servant and forcibly transport him out of the country.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

                    miles from the nearest plantation economy can hardly be compared with an American frontier. Yet both

                    </placeName> Abolition Society had limited its purpose to eradicting the slave trade. Individual
                    members might look forward to slave emancipation, he said, but this objective could be obtained only
                    by "such gradual and temperate means as the colonial assemblies may adopt." This
                    extreme caution, it appears in retrospect, sprang from the very values that led to the condemnation
                    of slavery. Slavery could not be tolerated as a necessary and permanent evil because it deprived
                    human beings of the responsibilities of free choice and of the recompense for labor, including
                    private property, on which freedom depended. This meant that the ultimate goal of freedom could not
                    be achieved by coercive means that destroyed the very fabric of law, consent, and property.</p>
            <p>Even the Quakers, who established the first model of collective emancipation, proceeded gradually and
                    with great caution as they dealt with the symptoms of "slavery withdrawal."
                    Beginning in the late 1750s they investigated the problem of members who were actively engaged in
                    the slave trade; in <placeName>

                    years for the Society of Friends to disengage itself from slaveholding even in the northern states;

            <p>Paul Finkelman seems surprised and somewhat outraged by his discovery that "whatever it was
                    supposed to accomplish, Article VI had little immediate impact on the legal status of slaves in the
                    area that would become the states of Indiana and <placeName>

                    </placeName>, where the bulk of the slaves in the territory lived." He suggests that
                    "had there been a full-fledged debate over Article VI a clearer sense of its meaning might
                    have emerged."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Apart from the fact that a full-fledged debate would
                    have destroyed, in all probability, any chance of agreement on an antislavery provision, what I find
                    surprising is the absence of any formal exemption of the Franco-American slaveholders from the
                    effects of Article VI. In 1798, when Congress debated a motion to extend the exclusion clause of the
                    Northwest Ordinance to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Territory, the advocates of slave exclusion acknowledged that the present settlers who
                    had arrived under the laws of <placeName>
                  <country reg="enk">England</country>, <country reg="sp">Spain</country>

                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> could not with justice be deprived of their property.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> The same
                    presumption prevailed in 1804 when Congress considered various proposals for restricting slavery and
                    the slave trade in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>. Yet despite the contradictions between Article VI and a section of the Northwest
                    Ordinance promising that Franco-Americans could retain the laws and customs then in force among them
                    "relative to the descent and conveyance of property," the new federal Congress did
                    nothing to clarify the issue and refused to comply with petitions requesting sanction for even the
                    kind of age-limited servitude found in the gradual emancipation acts of the northern states.
                    Although Congress also failed to veto territorial laws allowing indentured servitude and barring the
                    residence of free blacks, the principle of prohibiting slavery remained intact.</p>
            <p>Finkelman is surely right when he points to the discrepancy between the later abolitionist image of
                    the Northwest Ordinance and the continuing vitality of slavery in the region. But one need <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Finkelman voices skepticism about the claims of the aging Coles, who was born seven months before the
                    Northwest Ordinance was enacted. Finkelman presents a brilliant but bleak account of the persistence
                    of slavery in parts of the Old Northwest during sixty-one years of Coles's life. But these
                    statistics must also be put in perspective. In 1820 there were still over 10,000 slaves in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

            <p>Finkelman might logically reply that the language of Article VI did not imply gradual emancipation.
                    But as he carefully demonstrates, the Northwest Ordinance said nothing about enforcement and failed
                    to clarify the options open to new states. This very ambiguity was probably essential for the
                    initial congressional consensus; it also converted the Ordinance into a charter document, as Andrew
                    R. L. Cayton and Peter S. Onuf have argued, which was subject to conflicting interpretations.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> The resulting uncertainty had one striking and incontrovertible consequence:
                    it deterred slaveholders from moving across the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. The Northwest
                    Ordinance, reinforced by flagrantly racist legislation and public opinion, maintained a preserve for
                    whites until there was no possibility that states created from the Northwest Territory would
                    legalize black slavery.</p>

            <p>This dramatic polarity, however deceptive in terms of wealth and economic growth, was a legacy of the
                    Northwest Ordinance. It provided the core of the Republican party's ideology, an ideology
                    that seemed convincing to millions of northerners who had no sympathy for the abolitionist cause. At
                    the end of the Civil War, Charles Sumner contended that the Confederate states had neither seceded
                    nor become conquered provinces. Having forfeited their rights by an act of rebellion, he claimed,
                    they had in effect reverted to the status of territories temporarily subject to congressional
                    control. Since the Constitution provided no guidelines for Reconstruction, Sumner turned
                    instinctively to the precedent of new beginnings, the precedent that had supposedly made the Old
                    Northwest a model republican society.</p>

            <p>The Northwest Ordinance is celebrated as one of the great documents of American history because it
                    envisaged an empire based upon principles novel at the time. By allowing what started in effect as
                    colonies to achieve full statehood in the Union, the Confederation Congress in one of its last acts
                    provided an innovative solution to the governance of the area north and west of the <geogName>Ohio
                        River</geogName>. Through recapitulating the hypothetical history of the original states, new
                    and yet-to-be-created territories were to gain eventually the rights and responsibilities of the
                    original states.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>Through such a novel solution the Confederation Congress brought yet another American institution

                    </placeName> posed problems concerning national identity, however, as leading Americans consciously
                    created an ideology of Americanism to measure the loyalty of new citizens and t o understand their
                    own place in history. On one hand the new ideals and institutions were presumed universally good for
                    all human beings and therefore the wave of the future. What the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    become in succeeding centuries. On the other hand America's new ideals and
                    institutions—be they political, social, or religious—seemed unique to the new <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> at the time. The fact that America's good fortune appeared an exception to the
                    world's normal condition seemed to demand the special nurture of its ideals and
                    institutions.</p>
            <p>Under such impressions Americans then and subsequently were ambivalent about receiving foreign
                    peoples into their society for fear they might contaminate, if not subvert, American life. Could
                    alien "others" appreciate American ideals or contribute toward social arrangements

                    </placeName> if they had lived under laws and institutions presumed completely opposite? Concern
                    about the effects of foreign peoples and their alien "otherness" on American
                    values and institutions went hand in hand, therefore, with proclaiming the higher ideals of the
                    American way of life as appropriate for the whole world.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The paradox of Americanism as ideology and in practice lay in this contradiction between proclaiming
                    American arrangements as good for all human beings but restricting their benevolence to a favored
                    few peoples among the world's societies. Dominant Americans' efforts to bound
                    their heterogeneous society excluded certain peoples as others and included themselves as true
                    Americans on grounds composed equally of an ideology of ideal institutions and an ideology of
                    peoplehood based upon ethnicity or race. As a result American leaders, intellectuals, and ordinary

                    represented opposite ways of living and behaving. For these white Americans the very concept of the
                    Indian denied middle-class proprieties, private property, and proper governance. Whether attempting
                    to understand Indian morals or economy, housing or government, family life or religion, most white
                    Americans measured the First Americans as a general image against those values, customs, and
                    institutions they most cherished in themselves. So alien was the Indian considered to the ideal
                    American way of life that native Americans were long denied citizenship in the nation in which they
                    were born.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>What Indians required in line with this imagery of their deficiency was drastic transformation to
                    approved American ways through the example of the very institutions they presumably lacked: small
                    private farms, formal churches and schools, and republican government. Through peaceful exhortation
                    and model institutions preferably but by annuity and force if necessary, leading Americans tried to
                    change Indian ways to conform to approved American ways of religion, economy, government, education,
                    family, and manners. Indians to become proper Americans were supposed to give up tribal government,
                    communal land ownership, and supposedly loose morals and marriage customs for bourgeois farming,
                    Christian religion, elective government, and the middle-class family. Public policies and private
                    philanthropy aimed to convert Indians into Americans by giving them what other Americans possessed
                    according to the ideology of Americanism. The Indian would thus be eliminated in favor of the
                    American, to paraphrase a slogan popular later among the self-designated (white) Friends of the

            <p>At the same time many, maybe most, whites believed that the Indian was congenitally incapable of
                    adopting civilized ways. A Senate Report in 1836 recapitulated briefly the "peculiarities
                    of constitution" attributed by so many whites to the Indian (in order to refute them):
                    "lst, An irresistable thirst for ardent spirits. 2d, An unnatural predilection for war. 3d,
                    An inordinate fondness for the hunter state; and, 4th, An unconquerable aversion to the improvement
                    of condition."<hi rend="sup">10</hi> For those whites who believed these attributes innate
                    to the Indian character, only the transfer of Indian lands to white hands, if not also the
                    elimination of the Indian through death or assimilation, would solve the problem of the Indian and
                    the Americanization of the West.</p>
            <p>American goals of transforming the Indians into good Americans conflicted with the drive to people
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> with good white Americans. Whether conceived of as noble or savage, the Indian stood in
                    the way of American progress according to the ideology of Americanism. The anomaly of the Indian was
                    resolved all too often in favor of white interests and advance over native residence and
                    civilizational transformation. In the competition for natural resources and lands, native lands were
                    claimed and often expropriated for supposedly higher white uses in the name of private property. The
                    goal of acculturation and assimilation was often superseded in favor of removal to the frontier and
                    continued segregation. Even Christianity and civilization were conceived as leading to reduced
                    Indian lands in native terms as well as a better Indian life in white terms. When the Cherokee,
                    Choctaw, and other southern tribes adopted white ways of farming, government, and religion in the
                    first three decades of the nineteenth century, they still found themselves forced to remove in the
                    name of progress and Americanism during the fourth decade.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>No matter what whites did to the Indian peoples, whether judged today as bad or good, altruistic or
                    crass, all was clone in the name of bettering their existence according to the ideals of
                    Americanism. White ideals therefore marched alongside material interests in the spread of the
                    American empire of liberty. In the end white policy was geared to help the Indian only in terms of
                    white conceptions of what the Indian needed. What the Indian needed was shaped by the long-standing
                    image of the Indian as alien to the American way of life.</p>

                    successful native resistance combined with English and Spanish interference, the new federal
                    government under President George <placeName>

                    treasury, and the seemingly inevitable expansion of white settlement. National honor was to be
                    preserved through the purchase of the lands occupied by Indian tribes who presumably would sell

                    assumed at its foundation that Indians possessed more lands than they could or would use by accepted
                    white standards and that therefore they would readily cede those lands to the government for small
                    sums of money and gifts. The policy also presumed that settlers on the frontier could be restrained
                    from occupying tribal lands even though they considered all Indian lands underutilized by white
                    standards of resource usage. If the policy were to succeed as publicly espoused, then the same fate
                    that decreed the increase of the white population on former Indian lands must also doom the Indians
                    to disappearance through death or acculturation.</p>
            <p>The policy rested, therefore, upon certain common white images of the Indians' ultimate fate
                    and their lack of attachment to home turf. To most white Americans the Indian appeared doomed to
                    extinction through disease as had been the case during earlier periods of contact. The Indian had
                    always seemed to vanish before white advance and would presumably continue to disappear as white
                    America expanded.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Moreover, whites assumed the remainder could and would
                    continue to remove westward according to the standard imagery of native migratory habits. Westward
                    migration like decimation from disease opened tribal lands to white occupation.</p>
            <p>What disease and migration did not achieve, acculturation would finish under this view.
                    Civilizational transformation of the Indian through acculturation would not only convert the
                    "savage" to a bourgeois lifestyle but would also reduce the need for extensive
                    tribal holdings because the land would be farmed American style. This supposedly more intensive use
                    of the soil would release large areas of surplus tribal lands for white acquisition. White policy at
                    its most philanthropic envisaged the exchange of white civilization for native resources and souls
                    to the ultimate benefit of both whites and Indians according to white understanding. Until the
                    Indians wanted to part with their lands, the federal government would prevent, by force if
                    necessary, the illegal intrusion of greedy white settlers into the legally separate Indian country.</p>
            <p>All in all, the basic policy of expansion with honor rested upon the assumption that the Indians need
                    not cede lands faster than their changing status encouraged or required and that whites would not
                    demand more land than the orderly advance of their frontier necessitated or stimulated them to
                    require. The policy always presumed that cessions would be obtained before too much white expansion
                    overwhelmed nearby tribes. Under this policy whatever was good for white Americans was also assumed
                    desirable for Indians, <list type="footnotes">

                    inclinations for the larger good of all as whites judged those higher ends.Since white expansion was
                    presumed not only unpreventable but as desirable as it was ultimately inevitable, policies for
                    western lands and Indians contained a fundamental contradiction. In the end white policymakers like
                    their frontier followers favored white progress through expansion of white settlement in the near
                    future over the preservation of Indians on their native lands for the approbation of an abstract
                    posterity. The Land Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance applied to areas that needed to be
                    vacated of Indian title before the two acts could become effective in practice. The Land Ordinance,
                    for example, presumed cession of tribal lands in the Old Northwest from the very beginning of
                        survey.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Likewise, the Northwest Ordinance could only operate in areas in
                    which <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> sovereignty had replaced tribal authority in actuality as well as in legal theory. The
                    territorial system, in fact, by creating new states in the West only added in practice to the
                    demands for faster Indian removal and land sales as the new representatives joined Congress. The
                    fight between the East and the West over Indian policy was not over the replacement of Indians by
                    Americans but over how soon and by what methods this was t o be accomplished.</p>
            <p>The anomaly built into the territorial system is conveyed well by the conflicting interests the
                    territorial governor was to serve. As Indian superintendent of his territory he was to protect the
                    Indians of his jurisdiction from white intrusion. As governor of the territory he was to aid whites
                    in their endeavors to bring the area under cultivation and progress. As commander of the
                    white-manned militia he was to order the enforcement of Indian regulations against local white
                    inhabitants as well as the protection of his white constituents against resentful Indians.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>Some politicians, officials, and missionaries thought that the establishment of an exclusively Indian
                    territory would eliminate or at least mitigate the contradictions between white expansion and Indian

                    the Choctaws, Cherokees, and Creeks must consent. The annual general council should contain no fewer
                    than twenty-four men elected by the tribes or selected from the chiefs. As soon as possible all the
                    council members should be elected in line with the preferred American mode of representation. The
                    governor possessed absolute power to veto legislation and to convene and adjourn the council. The
                    confederated tribes could elect a delegate to Congress by a method prescribed by the council
                    "in order t o encourage the said tribes, and to promote their advancement in the arts of

                    members, as with all arbitrary territorial governments, were strictly under the control of the

                    to what was considered the Five Civilized Tribes' stage of acculturated progress.</p>

                    passage in the House of Representatives. Later, in both 1837 and 1839, the Senate passed an Indian
                    territorial bill by a large majority, but each time it died in the House. Modifications demanded in
                    the series of bills suggest some of the specific issues: the territory should be allowed only an
                    agent in the capital, not a delegate to sit in Congress; the title of governor disappears in favor
                    of superintendent of Indian affairs; the method of selection and the number of tribal council
                    members varies; the official journal of proceedings must be kept in English; all laws passed by the
                    council must be accepted by the president. Throughout the decade of the 1830s, however, all versions
                    of the bills looked forward to the creation of a single consolidated political entity premised upon
                    the supercession if not also the destruction of the tribal governments and the continual
                    intervention of a paternalistic federal government.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>As with the establishment of other territories, the creation of an Indian one raised questions over
                    the extension of slavery, sectional balance in Congress, and partisan opposition to executive
                    control over the temporary government. Congressmen, however, wondered in this instance whether the <placeName>

                    </placeName> should encourage the consolidation of Indian enemies or foster an Indian state. Still

                    stage of political progress in their own governments that warranted the equality conferred by
                    full-fledged statehood in the Union. In the end racist fears of fostering continued Indian
                    "otherness" by permitting an ethnically based territory won out over the American

            <p>Of course, all the plans always aimed a t creating an Indian government on the American model
                    complete with elections and representation proportional to population as opposed to either
                    traditional or acculturated Indian ways. The dilemma for officials, missionaries, and other whites
                    supporting the creation of an Indian territory was always how to permit a tribe's control
                    of its own affairs as so often guaranteed in the treaties of removal and yet direct the various
                    tribes into a new intertribal consolidated confederacy and council. The ultimate goal of all the
                    plans reduced to the idea advanced by the Baptist missionary Isaac McCoy, who so indefatigably
                    throughout the 1830s lobbied for such a territory and who hoped to preside over any Indian territory
                    created. Following McCoy's ideas, Thomas L. McKenney believed that the Indians should
                    "be placed under a Government, of which they shall form part, and in a Colonial relation to
                    the <placeName>

                    </placeName>.… In a Colony of course, the existing divisions among the Tribes would be
                    superseded by a General Gov't for the whole… ."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
                    Surely such colonization through confederation sought a cheaper and more efficient mode of
                    controlling the tribes, as the government Indian agents in the field told their charges, but it also
                    hoped to destroy tribal institutions and solidarity in favor of American ways.</p>
            <p>The Cherokee, Choctaw, and Creek of the so-called Civilized Tribes opposed all these efforts to
                    consolidate their governance and to supercede their own acculturated forms of government through
                    some political entity not controlled by themselves as violating the long-term treaty obligations of
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. After all, their members had adopted in the 1820s white models of government complete
                    with constitutions and law codes, two-house legislatures, chief executives, courts and judges, and
                    the other trappings of the American way of governance at the behest of the federal government and
                    missionaries, and still the southern states demanded their removal. The <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> authorities even used the Cherokees' new republican form of government to
                    justify their removal on the grounds that under the federal Constitution a new state could not be
                    formed within the boundaries of an older one without its consent. Thus a temporary government for an

                    the opinion of some congressmen.</p>
            <p>The idea of an Indian territory based on customary American principles violated the Indians'
                    right to their own form of acculturated self-government as they had adapted to American

                    to erect an Indian territory according to the usual territorial model of arbitrary government as
                    destructive of their own forms of government and the supposed sovereignty they possessed. To them it
                    smacked of the customary paternalism and efforts to erode Indian rights if not to steal their lands
                    as well through allotment in severalty, which was so often part of the package. That other tribes
                    were to gain equal or even proportional representation in the territorial council with the Civilized
                    Tribes only further convinced the latter of the nefarious purposes of the territorial scheme.</p>
            <p>What the federal government was not able to achieve in consolidation of the Five Civilized Tribes on
                    their new lands and the imposition of a unified intertribal government before the Civil War, it
                    tried again after the ostensible defeat of the those tribes as allies of the Confederacy. The peace
                    treaties generally specified participation in an elected general council of the Indian tribes
                    presided over by a governor or superintendent of Indian affairs and the establishment of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> courts and marshals as well as land cessions for other tribes still to be removed,
                    emancipation of Indian-owned slaves, and railroad rights of way across remaining tribal lands.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> For the following two decades numerous bills were presented for the formation
                    of a government for the tribes in the Indian territory, but none was enacted into law.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Most of the bills provided for a system of government modified and elaborated from the
                    second stage as defined in the Northwest Ordinance with a two-house legislature with members usually
                    elected proportionally to tribal populations; a presidentially appointed governor (with veto),
                    attorneys and marshals, judges of supreme and district courts; and a delegate to the House of
                    Representatives elected by the council or the voters. Often these officers were required to take an
                    oath of loyalty to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and its laws. Sometimes the bills specified that the legislators and others be of
                    Indian descent, and one bill proposed creating a territorial government staffed and elected by
                    American citizens of African descent. Many of the bills establishing territorial government also
                    provided for allotment in severalty and sales of the residual lands.</p>

            <p>Once again it was a clash of sovereignty, and in the long run the Five Civilized Tribes lost in favor
                    of American-defined progress. Congressmen seemed to believe, as one Senate Report of 1870 argued,
                    that the Fifteenth Amendment obligated Indian assimilation: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It is in consonance with the new policy of the government, born of the war and matured by the

            <p>With the economic development of the states around the Indian Territory, white demands for lands and
                    resources of the native inhabitants of the territory increased in Congress as well as in tribal
                    councils. The policy of allotment in severalty offered in the eyes of the self-denominated Friends
                    of the Indians opportunities for the final Americanization of the Indians through their
                    detribalization. Forced settlement upon small farms patented to their owners eventually would
                    destroy the communal foundations of tribal society in favor of American individualism. Other white
                    but crasser citizens saw only the surplus lands being sold to good capitalists of their own kind.</p>
            <p>The devastating General Allotment Act of 1886, which forced the breakup of tribal lands into
                    individually owned homesteads according to the American way of property holding, excluded the Five
                    Civilized Tribes from its provisions because of their adamant opposition. After 1889, however, the
                    lands of other tribes in the western half of the Indian Territory rapidly opened to white settlement
                    in the famous series of land rushes. Congress established the territory of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName> with a second-stage government to embrace these areas as they opened to white
                    settlement, once again demonstrating the relationship between ethnicity and territory making.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although the Five Civilized Tribes sought to organize the Indian Territory as a separate state with
                    the continuation of their own tribal governments and land tenure customs, Congress had other plans.
                    Those tribes' lands were brought under special allotment in the early years of the
                    twentieth century; thus, the tribes and their land patterns were prepared eventually to enter the
                    union as Americanized people. When the land basis of the tribal societies was dispersed as
                    homesteads, the legal basis for the tribal governments was considered dissolved in the view of
                    official <placeName>

                    Albert J. Beveridge, chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories, favored the admission of the

                    predominated even in the Indian territory.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> When tribal authority and
                    institutions disappeared in 1906 in the area traditionally governed by the Five Civilized Tribes,
                    Congress was persuaded finally to pass an act enabling a constitutional convention to draw up a
                    constitution for the unified state of <placeName>

                    citizens were Indian, and its new state constitution, by requirement of Congress, forbade the sale
                    of alcohol to them.</p>
            <p>Did Congress ever intend the Indian Territory to become an Indian state equal to other states in the
                    Union? Congress never created a government for the territory when Indians predominated and never
                    permitted a delegate to Congress from those tribes that were allowed one by treaty. Clearly tribal
                    Indian and American citizen were considered opposing roles. Only through allotment and
                    detribalization were Indians made citizens and permitted to become part of an American state. To the
                    extent that Congress considered establishing a n Indian territorial government, it was usually a
                    device for acculturation and assimilation of aboriginal inhabitants according to the ideals of
                    Americanism.</p>
            <p>Congressional efforts to create an ethnically Indian territory revealed the fundamental contradiction
                    between the ideology of Americanism as a set of supposedly universal ideals and their ethnic biases
                    as applied t o the Indian. That Congress considered so many bills establishing an ethnic Indian
                    territory and that the Senate even passed two of them speaks to the ideal of incorporating Indians
                    into <placeName>

                    </placeName> society as self-governing peoples on the model of other territories. That no one bill
                    ever passed both houses speaks to the ethnic prejudices of Americanism vis-á-vis the
                    Indian. Partisan opposition and sectional balance played their role in the failure of these bills to
                    become laws, but the debates over the nature of the proposed governments as well as the actual
                    administration employed provide evidence of the usual ambivalence <list type="footnotes">

                            outlined the criteria for granting statehood: "The advancement of the people, their

                    Un-Americans into their society. The lesson of this Indian territorial history would seem to be that
                    the erection of a new territory, like the admission of a new state, depended upon the prevalence of
                    an ethnically acceptable—that is, "American"—population as
                    well as the predominance of the same kind of Americans in running the government.</p>
            <p>Alaskan history under American jurisdiction offers further proof of this hypothesis for Indian
                    peoples. Article three of the treaty of purchase exempted the "uncivilized native
                    tribes" from its provision for granting the residents of Alaska the rights, advantages, and
                    immunities of <placeName>

                    after cession, in so far as it could be said to be governed at all, before Congress designated
                    Alaska in 1884 not even a territory but a "civil and judicial district." This
                    novel government resembled a highly arbitrary first stage of territorial government under the rule
                    of a governor, district judge, clerk of court, marshal and four deputy marshals, and four
                    commissioners who acted like justices of the peace. With the administration of Alaska under far
                    greater federal control than was usual in early territorial government at the time, Congress refused
                    to extend the Constitution to Alaskans and prohibited, as in other areas defined as Indian country,
                    the importation of liquor.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

                    the early twentieth century the whole issue of Alaskan governance had become entwined with

                    politics, stalled statehood. Only in 1958 did Alaska finally become the forty-ninth state. Sparse as
                    the population appeared to the eyes of many congressmen, "Americans" outnumbered
                    the natives by six to one in accord with the history of previous territories. By that time, however,

                    modeled on its provisions. In the end the territorial system presumed governments elected and run by
                    white Americans, for those dominant in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> denied as an ideal and refused to recognize in practice the plural society the nation
                    was. As a consequence, Indian peoples were long refused citizenship in the nation of their birth and
                    treated as problems to be solved rather than as cultures to be accepted. The ideological basis of
                    Americanism demanded that all other peoples adopt American ideals in order to be fully accepted in
                    the national society, but the ethnic bias of Americans if not Americanism itself classified certain
                    peoples as "others" too un-American to be assimilated.</p>
            <p>No peoples proved the paradox inherent in Americanism more than those collectively designated <hi rend="i">Indian</hi> by the white populace. That American colonies were known as territories
                    further concealed the nature of the native peoples' plight as the result of an ambivalent,
                    but imperial, Americanism. Americanism in its best interpretation—as a code of high
                    ideals—blinded most politicians, intellectuals, and other citizens to the continued
                    efforts of native peoples to maintain separate societies and cultures. The American territorial
                    system provided and demanded but one kind of governmental model for all peoples. If America was
                    plural in ethnicity and Americanism was ambivalent in ideal, the history of Indian relations in
                    general and the history of Indian territory making in specific shows that the motto of <hi rend="i">e pluribus unum</hi> applied both to ethnicity and government in the American way of doing
                    things for (and to) Indians.</p>

            <p>Between July, 1987, and June, 1988, a remarkable exhibit will tour each of the six states of the Old
                    Northwest, offering visitors an opportunity to observe a significant collection of documents and
                    illustrations connected with the bicentennial of two great texts of freedom: the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Constitution and the Northwest Ordinance. The exhibit is a collaborative effort
                    sponsored by the alumni associations of the nine Big Ten universities located within the Old
                    Northwest and six libraries and historical societies within those states. Commencing a t the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Minneapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Relying upon materials drawn exclusively from the collections of these six host
                    institutions, and particularly from the Clements and the Lilly libraries, the exhibit is, like its
                    subjects, of both regional and national significance.</p>
            <p>The exhibition contains 122 items, 63 of which deal with the Ordinance and 59 with the Constitution,
                    testifying to the richness and variety of source materials available within the Midwest. Materials
                    from the Clements Library dominate the treatment of the Northwest Ordinance, while the Lilly
                    Library's collections are paramount in the treatment of the Constitution. The exhibit,
                    however, approaches the two documents in very different ways. Items dealing with the Constitution
                    focus upon the critical years from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Annapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> convention in 1786 to the tardy ratification by Rhode <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="110" id="VAA4025-084-1-114"/> Island in 1790 and explore in detail the process of writing and
                    approving the document. Items dealing with the Ordinance on the other hand range over more than a
                    century from the dawning concern for western issues in the 1750s to the admission of the last of the
                    Old Northwest states, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1859. The treatment of the Constitution—relying almost exclusively upon
                    contemporary newspapers, pamphlets, and manuscripts—attests to the current significance
                    of the study and the interpretation of basic texts by both academic and public figures. Four-fifths
                    of the Constitutional entries focus upon the process of ratification, stressing the remarkable
                    variety of arguments and viewpoints that emerged in the months immediately following the adjournment
                    of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> convention. Announcements of ratification parades stand next to heated denunciations by
                    critics later termed Anti-Federalist, a vivid preface to the range of celebration and analysis that
                    the planners of the exhibit undoubtedly hoped to encourage. The particular selection of pamphlet and
                    newspaper articles further suggests that the exhibit's organizers were often influenced by
                    the current emphasis upon the ideology of republicanism as a shaping force in explaining and
                    producing the constitutional system.</p>
            <p>The materials dealing with the Northwest Ordinance on the other hand show a special concern for the
                    visual representation of the West by cartographers, engravers, and popular cartoonists, whose varied
                    products represent fully half the items in this portion of the exhibit. Here the emphasis is upon
                    image rather than upon text, with planners of the exhibit striving to trace the progress and
                    accomplishments of the Northwest Ordinance within the larger context of the progress of settlement
                    and comprehension of the trans-Appalachian West. Some viewers may question the comparatively heavy
                    emphasis upon the Indian wars and treaties of the period between 1790 and 1815. All will be
                    impressed, however, by the remarkable contributions of geographers and mapmakers to both official
                    and public understanding of the background and implications of the survey and settlement provisions
                    of the Ordinance. The exhibit is both a tribute and an invitation to interdisciplinary study.</p>
            <p>Considerations of space in six very different host facilities imposed severe limitations upon the
                    designers of the display itself and tended to separate the more visually striking maps and prints
                    from the rows of printed materials. Combined with the subdued lighting necessary to preserve ink and
                    paper, the display cases are sometimes more a feast for mind than for eye. Yet many items retain
                    their inherent fascination: Thomas Jefferson's copy of <hi rend="i">The Federalist</hi>
                    papers with his handwritten attributions of authorship, Rufus <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s letter accepting the presidency in 1789 are among the gems of the
                    collection. The midwestern sense <pb n="111" id="VAA4025-084-1-115"/> of place shines through the
                    exhibition, from Lord Shelburne's detailed manuscript map of the deployment of British
                    forces in the 1760s, through Thomas Hutchinson's map of the River <placeName>

            <p>Those unable to visit the exhibition may still capture an excellent sense of both its content and its
                    design through the attractive catalog prepared to accompany the tour.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    <hi rend="i">Liberty's Legacy</hi>contains specific citations to each of the exhibit
                    entries together with explanatory notes that are in most cases more detailed than the descriptive
                    cards in the display itself. Accompanying the text are illustrations of sixty-two of the exhibit
                    entries, fourteen of which are presented in full color. Browsers will enjoy many of the colorful and
                    insightful details of the individual entries, although at times the link between particular items
                    and the overall theme of the exhibit is not clearly developed. The entries properly focus upon the
                    historical background and significance of the material in the exhibition. Quite apparent, however,
                    is the obvious care and consideration that the donors and curators of the host institutions have
                    shown in assembling and preserving these significant and sometimes unique materials.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Liberty's Legacy</hi> also contains two informed popular introductions to the
                    ideas and themes raised by the documents in the exhibit. Pauline Maier's essay on the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Constitution focuses upon the traditional theme of the critical period in American
                    history and upon the attempts of young men of the American Revolution t o find a system of
                    government that could indeed balance order with liberty. Unlike the ratification-focused materials
                    of the exhibition, she concentrates upon the central issues that were raised in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> convention itself, striving to lay a foundation within which the later debates in the
                    state conventions can be placed and understood. Maier is particularly concerned with the definition
                    of federalism and with the complicated theoretical plans and practical compromises that resulted in,
                    as she styles it, "a new form of government."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Her attached

                    and the contemporary importance of Gordon S. Wood.</p>
            <p>In "The Importance of the Northwest Ordinance," Peter S. Onuf summarizes many of
                    the themes and insights that he has ably developed in his recent writings. The essay will be of
                    particular interest to midwestern readers. Here the focus is upon union, upon the desire of eastern
                    political leaders to incorporate the West within the American system of government, but to
                    incorporate it under terms and conditions that would support, rather than threaten, the established
                    political order. Onuf concentrates upon the theme of responsibility within the Ordinance, noting
                    that its provisions for education, secure land title, and gradual development of self-government
                    were consistent with a desire to attract settlers of substance and judgment to the Old Northwest. He
                    is careful to point out a close link between the Ordinance adopted in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> in July of 1787 and the Constitution being framed a t the same time in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At the same time he recognizes the fact that while the authors of the Ordinance
                    envisioned the expansion of the American system, they also envisioned the document's own
                    extinction as it was gradually replaced by the constitutions of the new states of the Northwest
                    Territory. Onuf effectively suggests that the Ordinance has played both real and symbolic functions
                    within the American Midwest and that it is best understood through appreciation of "the
                    challenges facing earlier generations" in the process of settlement.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                    He is deeply impressed by the irony inherent in a document designed to promote union and yet, in its
                    antislavery provisions, ultimately capable of contributing to a sense of sectionalism.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Liberty's Legacy</hi> is, in short, public programming of a high order. In its
                    blend of analytic interest, archival attention, and celebratory display, it suggests the rich range
                    of approaches available to students of both national and regional culture in 1988. Just as the
                    Revolutionary bicentennial of 1976 provided springboards to subsequent study and programming, so the
                    Big Ten traveling exhibit invites Americans to explore and probe the role played by the great texts
                    of 1787 in understanding both past and present in Indiana and the nation.</p>
