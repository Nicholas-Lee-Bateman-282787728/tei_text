					<head rend="b center">Definition of<lb/> The "City Manager Plan"</head>

					<list type="simple">
						<item rend="i">1. Unification of Powers:</item>
						<item>All corporate powers to be vested in a single group of elective officers,
							constituting a Council or Commission.</item>
						<item>[The unification of powers is essential in order to avoid confusion of
							responsibility. There should be no other elected officers in the city government.
							Every power of the city should be possessed by the council. This makes it impossible
							for the council to lay the blame on any other officer if things go wrong. If there is
							no one who can hinder the council in its work the council is robbed of every possible
							excuse and is obliged to "face the music" in times of public criticism.</item>
						<item>Unification of powers is a basic merit of the commission plan and must not be
							departed from in the city manager plan.]</item>
						<item rend="i">2. The Short Ballot.</item>
						<item>The Council to be elected in one of the following ways:</item>
						<item>(a) at large (if the number of members to be chosen at any one time is five or
							less).</item>
						<item>(b) by wards.</item>
						<item>(c) by proportional representation.</item>
						<item>[The need for the Short Ballot is based on the familiar psychological difficulty
							which the average voter will have in remembering more than a short list of candidates.
							Experience with non-partisan ballots and party primary elections has demonstrated that
							when the number of offices is five or less, each voter will pick out his own ticket to
							suit himself and thus express a genuine personal opinion with every mark of his
							pencil. On the other hand, if the number to be chosen exceeds five, the average voter
							will accept some ready made ticket devised for him by a civic club or a party machine,
							which has been promoted and advertised en bloc. The real selection and control of
							public officers then shifts from the voters to the makers of the tickets, who thus
							acquire an influence that is capable of great abuse.</item>
						<item>In a large city of upwards of 150,000, the mere size of the electoral unit acts as
							a discouragement to independent candidates of moderate means and gives advantage to
							organize standing political organizations, inasmuch as the task of improvising an
							equally effective impromptu vote-getting organization is too much for the resources of
							the individual candidate. In large cities, therefore, ward election or proportional
							representation is advised, as a genuinely free and open competition for office is more
							likely to ensue. Ward election's have a bad name in this country, yet they are highly
							successful in England, the difference being that ward offices in this country have
							been characteristically unimportant and obscure. In the city manager plan, however, a
							member of council elected from the ward will be an exceedingly important officer, one
							of the supreme directors of the city, in fact, and not overshadowed by a mayor or any
							other city officer in the campaign. A ward election under these circumstances will be
							a different matter than in the past.</item>
						<item>Proportional representation on the so-called Hare plan is in successful operation
							abroad, although it is as yet unfamiliar to Americans. It is undoubtedly the most
							scientific method for electing a truly representative board. A city which under the
							ordinary system might elect a board of nine Republicans would, under proportional <pb
								id="VAB8218-004" n="4"/> representation, elect a board of four Republicans, two
							Democrats, two Progressives and one Socialist, each party securing the election of its
							favorite candidates in the order of their strength with their party voters, each party
							having just the proportion of members that it is entitled to.</item>
						<item>The advantage of proportional representation is its fairness to all hands and the
							stability which it gives to the city government by preventing sharp changes in control
							due to mere fluctuating majorities. Proportional representation is impracticable in
							the commission plan, but the city manager plan which makes the council a
							representative body opens the way for it in America. It is a favorite proposal of the
							Socialists, who see that under this system they would poll their fullest strength
							without losing the support of those sympathizers who now hate to waste their vote on a
							party that now has no immediate chance of victory.]</item>
						<item rend="i">3. Executive Organization:</item>
						<item><hi rend="b">Non-political</hi> executive functions delegated to an official
							appointed by the Commission to serve during their pleasure, to be known as the "City
							Manager" or by other appropriate title; position of city manager to be open to
							non-residents; salary of city manager to be determined by the Council and variable
							from time to time; the city manager's executive powers to include appointment and
							removal and general control of all subordinates, subject to such restrictions (e.g.,
							civil service regulation and audit) as may be necessary to prevent abuses of power
							without diffusing responsibility.</item>
						<item>[The general advantages of creating the new office of city manager are treated at
							length elsewhere in this pamphlet.</item>
						<item>The city manager must be strictly the servant of the council, with no
							independence. The council must have absolute control of him and not be able to say "it
							is the city manager's fault and we can't overrule him." The city manager must not have
							any fixed tenure or any protection against swift removal, save possibly the right to
							an explanation of the reasons for his discharge and an opportunity to present his
							defense.</item>
						<item>While the manager will be expected to make all the subordinate appointments, there
							is no safe way of preventing the council from having and exercising an opinion
							regarding appointments. On the other hand, in the hope of keeping questions of
							patronage away from the council, it would be advisable not to require confirmation of
							appointments by the council, or in fact demand in the charter any specific action by
							the council in such matters. The feature of the Dayton plan which provides that the
							manager may be recalled by the people is of dubious value, since it interferes with
							the accountability of the council and gives opportunity for public hostility to be
							directed at the manager rather than at the elected board. The council should not be
							given this opportunity to let the manager be the scapegoat. Neither should the council
							be given this opportunity to justify their retention of an unsatisfactory manager by
							saying that the people must have approved this attitude, since they did not recall the
							manager.] <hi rend="right">R. S. C.</hi></item>

					<milestone unit="typography" n="____________" rend="center"/>

					<p>In December, 1910, the Board of Trade at Lockport, N.Y., began to grow weary of the way
						municipal affairs had been run in their town under the familiar and complicated mayor
						and council plan of organization. Like hundreds of other bodies, they turned
						instinctively to commission government. But there was no optional law on the statute
						books which they could adopt, as is now the case in many states, by which the only
						proceeding necessary to put the law into effect is to secure a local referendum. </p>
					<p>Unxpectedly there was presented to the board a bill whose purpose was to put a form of
						commission government within the reach of every third-class city in the state. The Board
						of Trade accepted this as their own and had it introduced in the legislature of 1911;
						hence the term "the Lockport bill."</p>
					<p>The form of government set forth in this measure has now come to be widely known as the
						"city manager plan." It is built upon certain conspicuous essentials of the simple type
						now in use in Galveston, Des Moines and nearly three hundred American cities: the
						unification of all the local powers of government in the hands elective body, and the
						Short Ballot. But here the similarity ends. It is true that in most of the applications
						of the city manager plan thus far, other features of commission government have been
						borrowed --election at large, non-partisan elections and the Initiative, Referendum and
						Recall. But none of these things is in itself essential to the definition of this new
						form of city government.</p>
					<p>It is on the administrative and executive side that the city manager plan introduces a
						radical change. The more familiar type of commission government makes each member of the
						council (usually five in all) the head of an operating department, either in an active
						or a supervisory capacity. Every member of the council or commission is expected to
						devote all, or at least a large part, of his time to the service of the city, and is
						paid a substantial salary. No single member of the commission, under most of the
						charters, could be called its executive head. The Mayor is such, in theory, but the
						other commissioners, as a rule, do not take him seriously as their superior, as well
						might be inferred from the fact that they stand with him on an equal basis of popular
						election.</p>
					<p>Commission government in the old sense, then, is a five-headed affair. It is not always
						intended to be such, but it is so regarded by the average citizen, and so it works out
						so in practie.</p>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">A SINGLE-HEADED ADMINISTRATION.</head>

						<p>The city manager plan does away with this five-headedness of municipal administration
							and substitutes a single head, not with advisory powers merely, but, with certain
							safeguards, with the powers of administrative "life and death," through actual control
							of appointments and removals.</p>
						<p>The chief executive or city manager is not an elective officer, but is appointed by
							the council; he therefore does not divide responsibility with the council, but is
							subordinate to it; he need not be, at the time of his appointment, a resident of the
							city, but may be chosen rom anywhere in the country; he is not chosen for a definite
							term, but holds office so long as he gives satisfaction to his superiors.</p>
						<p>There are, however, certain exceptions to the executive powers to be exercised by the
							city manager. A city is not altogether a business affair; it is, in certain respects,
							a political agency, and there are some occasions on which it has been thought suitable
							that the official head of the city should be an elective one. There come in the
							history of many cities times of great public danger, when it is necessary that the
							ordinary machinery of government be set aside in favor of a single person who can get
							quickly on his own initiative--occasions, for example, such as those which beset the
							Ohio cities in the floods of March, 1913.</p>
						<p>To meet such contingencies the Lockport bill, and most of its successors, have
							provided that the Mayor should be the head of the city for the purposes of the
							military law, under which he has power, when necessity arises, to govern the city by
							proclamation. Also, it was thought fitting that on ceremonial occasions, as when the
							President is to be welcomed to the town, that the "head of the city" should be its
							first citizen. And so for such purposes and for the service of legal process in civil
							actions to which the city is a party, the Lockport bill provided that the Mayer should
							be the head of the city; not that <note id="note_001"><ref target="ref_001"
								>*</ref>October 15, 1913.</note>
							<pb id="VAB8218-006" n="6"/> he should be elected as such, but should be "that member
							of the city council who at the regular election of city officers shall have received
							the highest number of votes cast." By not diverting the attention to the Mayor, the
							bill aimed to focus the whole scrutiny of the voters on the council, to the end that
							the highest possible type of citizens would be chosen for that body.</p>

						<head rend="center">SUMTER, S. C.</head>

						<p>Lockport never came under the influence of such a charter, much as the people of that
							city are desirous of coming out from under boss rule and putting their public affairs
							on the business basis. The legislature of 1911 did not see Lockport conditions in
							quite the same light. It remained for the little city of Sumter, S. C. (population
							8,109), to pick up the general idea, influenced partly by the example of Staunton,
							Va., which had a general manager with functions somewhat different from those of the
							proposed city manager of Lockport. Sumter voted, on June 12, 1912, on an option
							between an old-line commission form and a new city manager plan, which carried out the
							Lockport idea in every essential. The latter was adopted by a majority of three to
							one. Early in the fall the first commission was elected, and there appeared at once
							one of the advantages of the new system over the old: The commission of three men
							which was elected was, according to all reports, composed of the strongest and ablest
							of men that could be brought together. They were not attracted to public office by the
							salary, which was only $200 a year. Nor, on the other hand, were they deterred from
							seeking the office by the prospect of having to perform detailed administrative
							duties, which, under the regular commission plan, would have been imposed upon them.
							They accepted the responsibility of running the government as a Board of Directors,
							knowing that under the charter it was not only possible, but required of them, to
							delegate the details of administration to a competent, trained man who would spend all
							his time on the job. They set out to secure such a man by sending this advertisement
							broadcast throughout the country:</p>
						<q rend="blockquote">
							<p rend="right">"October 14, 1912.</p>
							<p>"The City of Sumter hereby announces that applications will be received from now
								till December the first for the office of City Manager of Sumter.</p>
							<p>"This is a rapidly growing manufacturing city of 10,000 population, and the
								applicant should be competent to oversee public works, such as paving, lighting,
								water supply, etc.</p>
							<p>"An engineer of standing and ability would be preferred.</p>
							<p>"State salary desired and previous experience in municipal work.</p>
							<p>"The City Manager will hold office as long as he gives satisfaction to the
								commission. He will have complete administrative control of the city, subject to the
								approval of the board of three elected commissioners.</p>
							<p>"There will be no politics in the job; the work will be purely that of an
								expert.</p>
							<p>"Local citizenship is not necessary, although a knowledge of local conditions and
								traditions will of course be taken into consideration.</p>
							<p>"A splendid opportunity for the right man to make a record in a new and coming
								profession, as this is the first time that a permanent charter position of this sort
								has been created in the United States.</p>
							<p>"At the request of the City Commissioners these applications will be filed with the
								Chamber of Commerce of Sumter, A. V. Snell, Secretary."</p>
						</q>

						<p>This attracted nation-wide attention. Every engineering journal of any prominence
							published it as news. Replies to the number of 150 came in, nearly all from trained
							civil engineers, the greater proportion of whom had had municipal experience.</p>
						<p>Thus did Sumter emulate the practice of German cities, which never select their
							Burgomasters for political reasons, but solely for ability--a practice which has
							resulted in the growth of a distinct profession of municipal administration. In
							January, 1913, the first city manager was selected--Mr. M. M. Worthington, a former
							civil engineer, a resident of Virginia, in the employ of the Southern Railway. Mr.
							Worthington immediatel showed the advantages of his training by putting into effect a
							cost system by which he saved more than ha his first year's salary on one or two items
							of expenditure By keeping proper account of the cart service in the public works
							department, he will save the city near $5,000 a year.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">SPREAD OF THE MOVEMENT.</head>

						<p>Sumter had not been operating long under the system when the town of Hickory, N. C.
							(population 3,716), became interested in a new city charter. One of her leading
							citizens discovered the Lockport law and preceeded to adapt it to his town. A charter
							was drawn up which followed the Lockport provisions <hi rend="i">verbatim</hi>, except
							that the city manager was charged with certain specific engineering duties, and that
							the council, instead of being chosen at large, was to be selected by wards. <pb
								id="VAB8218-007" n="7"/> The people accepted the charter in April, 1913, andr as in
							the case of Sumter, the city manager was chosen from the outside.</p>
						<p>The Hickory charter was picked up by the commission in Morganton, N. C. (population
							2,713). Making a few very slight changes in the Hickory charter, the citizens of this
							town took it up to the Capitol and had it enacted as their basic local law.</p>
						<p>At this point the city manager plan ceases to be an exclusive Southern institution.
							In September, 1912, the cities of Ohio were emancipated from the state legislature by
							constitutional amendment. They were henceforth no longer required to go down to
							Columbus whenever they wanted to issue a bond for street improvement or to hire a new
							clerk. They could now do what Anglo-Saxon towns could do a thousand years ago: run
							their own local affairs as their local consciences and good sense dictated, instead of
							having to appeal to the wisdom of the up-state farmers.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">DAYTON, O.</head>

						<p>Immediately after the adoption of the home-rule movement, the Ohio cities began to
							talk of the charter revision, and if any one of them was more eager for
							self-government than another, it was Dayton (population 116,577). This city has a
							large number of civic and improvement societies which are constantly on the lookout
							for the "best things going" for their city. Sumter had recently adopted the new plan
							and the Chamber of Commerce was sending out pamphlets broadcast. Some of these fell
							into good hands in Dayton, and it was but a very short time before the Chamber of
							Commerce and the Bureau of Municipal Research and a variety of o organizations had
							decided to insist upon the city manager idea as the starting point for a new charter.
							After an interruption on account of the flood, the local campaign was brought to its
							conclusion. By this time the city manager sentiment was so overwhelming that the
							ticket of charter freeholders nominated by the Citizens' Committee and committed to
							the new plan was elected on May 20, 1913, by a more than two to one majority. The
							commission fulfilled its obligations and produced what is perhaps the most advanced
							city charter ever drawn for a large American city. The original Lockport law was
							followed closely, with the single incidental variation that the city, manager may be
							recalled by popular election in the same manner as an elective officer.</p>
						<p>At about the same time as the Dayton movement, there sprung up a very strong interest
							in the plan in Youngstown and Elyria. In both these cities, before the charter
							revision commissioners had proceeded far with their deliberations, they became
							convinced of the virtues of the city manager plan, and both of them drafted charters
							along this line, again sticking close to the Lockport law. The Youngstown charter,
							however, provided that the members of the council should be nine in number, and that
							they should be nominated from wards but elected at large, thus emphasizing the fact
							that the Short Ballot does not require the abolition of local representation. Another
							and more serious deviation from the model charter was the provision that the city
							manager, at the time of his appointment, must be a resident of Youngstown for a period
							of five years. The reason for this was not a scientific one, but had its genesis in a
							certain local prejudice against giving such an important public office to a
							non-resident.</p>
						<p>The only deviation in the Elyria charter was the provision which made the solicitor,
							city clerk, auditor and treasurer direct employees of the commission instead of the
							city manager, as the Lockport law provided. In the case of the solicitor and the
							clerk, it was pointed out that these officers had a very intimate and direct
							relationship to the council or commission in the shaping of its policies and the
							keeping of its records. The auditor and treasurer, so it was thought, should act as
							administrative checks upon the city manager.</p>
						<p>Both the Youngstown and Elyria charters were defeated by the people. This was due on
							the one hand to the very vigorous opposition of the politicians, and on the other to
							the insufficient publicity given to the charter provisions.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">OTHER OHIO CITIES</head>

						<p>Success, however, again met the city manager plan in Springfield (population 46,921),
							which adopted its new charter on August 26, 1913. The Springfield charter follows
							closely the one drawn up in Dayton, except that, like the Elyria charter, it takes
							certain of the general officers out of the control of the city manager and puts them
							under the commission.</p>
						<p>The next Ohio city to be influenced was Sandusky, where at the present writing a
							charter commission is in session, which is committed to the city manager plan. It is
							also possible in Ohio still to amend the municipal code so as to permit the cities,
							without the somewhat troublesome procedure of electing a charter convention and
							framing a charter, to adopt ready-made forms of city government. Accordingly, there
							was passed in the session of 1913 a law which permits any city to come under one of
							three forms of government--the federal, the <pb id="VAB8218-008" n="8"/> comission and
							the city manager plans. It was a distinct gain for this radically new type of city
							government to get recognition like this in a large state like Ohio.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">THE MOVEMENT IN THE WEST.</head>

						<p>Going back to March, 1913, we find that the city manager idea took root in a small
							city in California--Whittier (population 4,550). The charter framers in this town,
							which enjoys home rule privileges like the Ohio cities, got hold of the Lockport law
							and proceeded to draft a charter with that as a basis. As in some other communities, a
							considerable opposition was developed on the part of the politicians and the
							ill-informed, and owing to these facts and to certain incidental features of the
							charter, it went down to defeat.</p>
						<p>La Grande, Ore. (population 4,843), adopted the plan on October 1.</p>
						<p>In Arizona three towns have become actively interested in the city manager plan,
							Douglas, Phoenix and Bisbee.</p>
						<p>In Douglas (population 6,437) a city manager charter of what may now be referred to
							as the conventional type was drawn up, but for reasons not unlike those operative in
							Whittier, was defeated. This result, however, did not deter the charter forces in
							Phoenix (population 11,134), for they drew up a charter on very much the same lines
							which was adopted by a three to one majority on October 11, 1913. The Phoenix charter
							departed from its precedent in fixing a definite salary for the city manager, and
							stipulating that he must be a resident of Phoenix at the time of his appointment. Most
							of the advocates of the plan regard both these provisions as serious departures from
							the type. As to the salary stipulation, the charter commissioners felt that the figure
							they set was high enough so as not to interfere with the responsibility of the
							governing body. The residence requirement, however, was put in on account of certain
							provisions of the state constitution.</p>
						<p>Another very active field of operation is Minnesota. At the last session of the
							legislature one of the representatives dropped into the legislative hopper a copy of
							the original Lockport bill with practically no changes. This bill passed the lower
							house, but in the rush of business was not reported out of the Senate. Later on,
							several cities in the state (which is in the home rule class) were introduced to the
							city manager idea; Little Falls (population 6,078) votes on Oct. 28, 1913, Brainerd
							(population 8,526) has a city manager charter ready and a vote will soon be taken upon
							it.</p>
						<p>Another southern city which voted on the plan October was Waycross, Ga. (population
							14,485) election here was adverse.</p>

						<head rend="center">POTENTIAL PROGRESS.</head>

						<p>Such is the obvious progress of the movement, but its real growth is not measured by
							these limits. The Clark act, providing for commission government for all third class
							cities in "Pennsylvania, was drawn in such a way that it will be possible after the
							terms of the first commission expire, to reduce the salaries of the commissioners. The
							president of the Allied Civic Bodies, who is largely responsible for the adoption of
							this act, makes no secret of the fact that the bill was so drawn that the second
							commission in any of these cities might elect to cut their own salaries down to a
							nominal figure and devote the amount thus saved to the salary of a city manager.
							Already there is a great deal of talk in favor of such a step in several of the
							Pennsylvania cities.</p>
						<p>The adoption of the new plan by Dayton has attracted more attention than the
							Galveston or Des Moines charters.</p>
						<p>As this article is written a most significant event has just taken place. Tacoma,
							Wash., has for four years been under a charter of the Des Moines type. It has not
							fulfilled expectations. To quote the Mayor: "In my opinion, the commission form of
							government as adopted in Tacoma has not been a success. There is too much log-rolling
							and trading. Instead of one government have five, each one objecting to the control of
							the council itself." The Mayor definitely comes out in favor of change to the city
							manager plan, and the Public Advancement League in the same city supports him in
							stand.</p>
						<p>Dallas is revising her charter, and there is a body of citizens there who are
							urgently advising a change to the Lockport system.</p>
						<p>There is a great likelihood that in the near future the National Socialist party, the
							members of which in their localities have usually been opposed to commission
							government, will endorse the city manager plan as the most democratic and best suited
							to carry out the objects which their large social program involves. They will insist
							however, on a more representative form of council than is provided in the Lockport
							plan. By the terms of the model charter, which has been prepared by Mr. Carl Thompson,
							head of the National Information Bureau of the party, the members of the council would
							be chosen by the Hare plan of proportional representation, which insures a voice for
							minorities and preserves the principles of the Short Ballot.</p>

					<milestone unit="typography" n="____________" rend="center"/>

					<p>The recent adoption by Sumter, S. C., of a new type of commission plan of government
						with the appointive City manager, is important. It is the first time in the United
						States that a municipal chief executive has been made appointive and put under
						continuous control instead of independent and under intermittent control. Pending the
						appearance in America of this principle, the short ballot movement was headed for a
						stone wall. For in demanding the reduction of the mischievous multiplicity of elective
						offices, we are met by the question "what offices would you make appointive and who
						would appoint them?" The natural and easy answer is to follow the tendency of the times
						and advocate casting all appointive power on the nearest chief executive. In New York
						state, for example, the New York Short Ballot Organization has presented constitutional
						amendments to the legislature, the effect of which is to give the governor control by
						appointment over the rest of the state ticket, namely, the secretary of state, state
						treasurer, attorney general, comptroller and state engineer and surveyor. It is easy to
						point to the parallel of the United States government for justification, or to the state
						of New Jersey.</p>
					<p>The matter of safeguards on the appointing power is brought up. The politician takes it
						for granted that the state senate will have power to confirm or reject the appointments
						of the governor. The New York amendment, however, recognized the fact that the senate
						habitually utilizes the power of confirmation to accomplish a theft of the whole power
						of appointment. Forthwith, the responsibility of the governor for the appointments
						becomes something of a myth, and public control is baffled by the inability of the
						people to know whether it was the governor who made a given appointment, or some
						senator. For while the number of rejections by a senate may apparently not be large, the
						real number of rejections is very large indeed. The governor may not even informally ask
						the senators, or the boss who rules them, if this or that nomination will be acceptable,
						knowing well the limitations which the politicians will set upon him.</p>
					<p>The history of the president's appointive power and its constriction by "senatorial
						courtesy" shows evils similar to those in New York state.</p>
					<p>Likewise, in cities where the council must confirm the <note id="note_002"><ref
								target="ref_002">*</ref>Reprinted from the "National Municipal Review," January,
							1913.</note> appointments of the mayor, an interchange of authority occurs and the
						council soon controls the patronage without the corresponding responsibility.</p>
					<p>With such cases in mind, the New York Short Ballot Organization drafted its amendment
						so as to give the governor power to appoint these minor state officers, without
						confirmation, and with power to dismiss at pleasure. The amendment, consistent with this
						principle, went beyond the offices which are now elective and made the governor's power
						of unconfirmed appointment complete throughout the whole administration, so far as the
						constitution was concerned.</p>
					<p>The mayor of New York City has similar power over all the department heads. He may
						appoint and remove without oversight by anybody, and this is considered one of the most
						modern and progressive features of the charter.</p>
					<p>The National Municipal League's model charter conferred this absolute power on the
						mayor.</p>
					<p>This is the present orthodox principle among reformers. The purpose is to clear the
						lines of responsibility from all entanglements; to make it impossible for an official
						charged with neglect to say "It wasn't my fault;" to get single-headed government
						instead of many-headed. The opposition promptly complains that this is
						over-concentration of power. The politicians, fearful of the appearance of any machine
						except their own, argue that the chief executive would use his enlarged patronage to
						build up a new machine. Of course, we answer that a new machine once in a while by way
						of variety, might be a good thing and that we would have the boss of the new machine
						right where we could hit him full and square.</p>
					<p>Nevertheless, it is my belief that there is a measure of soundness in the opposition to
						uncontrolled appointive power and that we must eventually give to the opponents of it a
						better answer than to say that it is at least better and safer than the confirmation
						plan.</p>
					<p>In no other democratic country do the people subject themselves so to the mercies of
						individual caprice as we already do. And, as I have shown, reformers are ready to carry
						it still further. In many of our cities it may fairly be said that the mayor holds half
						the city power within his personal grasp. Certainly if we take into account his ability
						to misuse patronage and veto like chessmen, the mayor comes pretty near being a majority
						in <pb id="VAB8218-010" n="10"/> many of our city governments. In this matter we are
						unique among the nations, and it is curious that a country which appears most afraid of
						a strong government, and in which the Jeffersonian idea appears dominant, should be the
						one in which single individuals are entrusted with greater uncontrolled power than
						anywhere else in Christendom.</p>
					<p>An instance of the dangers involved is New York City, where the mayor recently had it
						within his power to upset the subway situation whenever he pleased, and frequently it
						seemed to the people of the town that he was likely to do so. He expressed opposition to
						what he called "cornfield routes" for subways and wanted the new tubes built where there
						was already the greatest number of passengers. If that one man had happened to be
						impervious to argument, future generations in New York City might have been condemned to
						live upon an insignificant fraction of the land which lay within a few miles of city
						hall, with congestion piled on congestion, instead of congestion being relieved by the
						opening up of new spaces.</p>
					<p>Similarly, the mayor of New York was charged with responsibility for an epidemic of
						crime, by reason of his causing sharp punishment of policemen who ventured to use their
						clubs. Matters reached a point where a gang of toughs could successfully forbid
						policemen to pass beyond the corner of a certain carbarn.</p>
					<p>After the terrible Asch factory fire in New York, two important bills, aiming at fire
						prevention, came before the mayor for acceptance. One represented the best thought of
						the public-spirited citizens of the town and the most careful draftsmanship. The mayor,
						without giving anybody a chance to explain, rejected it because he thought his pet
						enemy, Hearst, had prepared it, and proceeded to sign the inferior measure.</p>
					<p>Whether my statements are just to the mayor or not, it is obvious that things fully as
						serious as this are easily conceivable, and a plan of government which permits the whims
						or failings of a single man to swing such vast interests, even temporarily, is not
						thoroughly sound.</p>
					<p>The chief ground for complaint against the uncontrolled-executive plan is, however, not
						its perilous strength, but the fact that the presence of these obvious perils compels us
						to withhold from our administrators the powers they need. They need not only complete
						undivided appointive power, but power to use their own discretion, power to make new
						rules, as they go along, to fit new situations, power to be agents instead of dummies of
						the law's minutiæ.</p>
					<p>Our municipal, state and national legislatures now must undertake to control by
						continuous and detailed legislation a multitude of highly technical matters which ought
						to be left to empowered administrative experts. The legislatures cannot safely delegate
						their powers to administrators because they cannot hold the administrators answerable
						for results and subject to punishment.</p>
					<p>The New York City government undertakes to prevent such holocausts as the Asch fire.
						There is a new fire prevention bureau, placed according to current orthodox theories,
						under the mayor's single control. The fact that the mayor is independent and
						uncontrolled makes it impossible to confer the vast necessary powers upon the fire
						prevention bureau without running the risk that those vast powers may be used improperly
						under a weak or opinionated executive, in which case there would be no appeal and all
						hope of reform must be hazarded upon the personality of the next mayor.</p>
					<p>Another great and vital feature of local legislation in New York City is the building
						code. At present the aldermen make it and the mayor approves and administers it. The
						present method has developed great scandals and the code is chronically out of date and
						unfair to business and costly to the people. The right method would be to have an
						appointive administrative building code board, served by an expert bureau and empowered
						to enact the code and keep it up to date and enforce it. If we attempt this at present
						we have three unhappy alternatives: (1) To let the mayor have the whole responsibility
						for the building code board with right to dismiss the members and appoint new ones at
						pleasure. This overstrains our willingness to depend on the wisdom of one man. (2) To
						let the mayor appoint, subject to confirmation by the council. This forks the line of
						responsibility and the principle has proven mischievous in practice. (3) To let the
						mayor appoint the building code board, but give the members long terms in rotation so
						that no one may or can alter a majority of the board in his term. This puts power beyond
						prompt popular control, prevents the retrieving of mistakes in appointment, and delays
						and baffles attempts at improvements as well as attempts at corruption. Thus Governor
						Wilson has been almost impotent in certain important matters which he was elected to
						carry through in New Jersey, because certain of his so-called subordinates have
						protected tenures and silently defy his efforts to install new methods. The people
						cannot be expected to analyze his excuses and duly hold him blameless. He has no redress
						and neither have the people, and there is nothing to do but wait for the years to roll
						round before reform can be effected. Power ought not thus to be delegated beyond control
						of responsible representatives of the people.</p>



					<pb id="VAB8218-011" n="11"/>


					<p>The recall puts a touch of flexibility into the plan of electing independent chief
						executives. So far as the recall goes, I favor it. But it is at best, clumsy, unwieldy
						and expensive. The horse needs a hand on the rein. It is not always wise to give him his
						head and then unhitch him and buy another horse if he turns off the road to nibble the
						grass.</p>
					<p>Upon a state legislature or a city legislature, i.e., a <hi rend="i">group</hi> of men
						who act in group, we willingly confer greater powers than we dare give one man, and all
						these large powers can, without diminution, be boldly and flexibly administered through
						a <hi rend="i">controlled</hi> chief executive.</p>
					<p>Such is the new office which has just been created in Sumter, S. C. The new charter of
						this little city (10,000 population) modifies the commission plan by making the
						commissioners act as a board, never singly, and perform all executive work through an
						appointive city manager, who holds office subject to their pleasure. The city manager
						may be hired from out of town and is simply the expert servant of the commission.</p>
					<p>Suppose New York adopted this plan by enlarging its present board of estimate and
						making it a supreme board of directors with no other elective officers to detract from
						its authority. That board of directors could hire a chief executive to carry out all its
						orders in proper co-ordination. There could be under this continuously controlled
						executive a building code board and a fire prevention board, for instance, to which
						could be safely sublet all the powers necessary to the proper regulation of buildings
						and the prevention of conflagrations. Then the public would have the right to disregard
						all details and simply hold the directors responsible for results.</p>
					<p>After the Asch fire nobody suffered politically except George McAneny, the borough
						president, and he was not responsible at all. But if a building burned and people died
						in it the public could with perfect justice demand of our proposed board of
						directors--"What did you let this happen for? You had plenty of power to prevent it!"
						And the directors, apologizing, would turn privately to their city manager and repeat,
						"What is the reason? Did you appoint real experts or amateurs on that fire prevention
						board? Didn't you have inspectors enough? Or money enough? What do you need to prevent
						another fire?" And the manager, fearing lest he lose his job for having thus gotten his
						superiors into trouble, will tear things loose in the fire board to locate and punish
						the cause of the inefficiency and see that proper new provisions are made to prevent
						forever the repetition of any such disaster.</p>

					<p>We cannot secure such a condition now because we dare not give to an uncontrolled
						executive such vast administrative discretion.</p>
					<p>The controlled-executive plan filters everything through a group. It reduces the
						personal equation. Without loss of administrative unity, it abolishes one-man power. A
						single man may have his ups and downs, his freaks and fancies, his militant points and
						his passive ones, his natural bents and moods, his pet departments and projects. A
						board, or commission, or council, or parliament, has none of these things--to a group
						such excesses are relatively impossible. Even if all the members were cranks, their
						combined judgment would be reliable--they would neutralize each other.</p>
					<p>This plan corresponds to the general manager under the board of directors in a business
						corporation. It gives the stability of the combined judgment of many men on matters of
						policy, but leaves execution to a single-headed controlled executive establishment.</p>
					<p>The controlled-executive plan goes far beyond the recall of the mayor. Its executive
						can be bounced out of office in less time than it takes to print the blanks for a recall
						petition.</p>
					<p>There are many other weaknesses of the independent-executive plan of government, all of
						which are corrected by the controlled-executive idea. I will simply name them.</p>
					<list type="simple">
						<item>1. The independence of the executive destroys continuity of the administrative
							policy. One mayor is a crank on finance and taxes, and devotes his attention to
							improving those matters, to the neglect of other departments which do not interest
							him. His successor leaves the financial reforms uncompleted and follows his own hobby
							of parks and schools.</item>
						<item>2. Election of administrators is unsound in principle, for the choice of an
							administrator is no more a natural popular function than the choice of an engineer or
							a landscape architect. Administration of modern cities is an expert's job and the best
							experts are not necessarily good vote-getters.</item>
						<item>3. The independent executive constitutes a separate city government and the
							attempt to compel him to work in harmony with the other "city governments" creates a
							costly and cumbersome mass of red tape. The council, for instance, in appropriating
							funds for the mayor to spend, will try to regulate the details of the expenditure,
							thus perhaps compelling what later in the course of the expenditure may be found to be
							extravagance or unwise economies or misdirected work.</item>
						<item>4. The independence of the executive destroys unity <pb id="VAB8218-012" n="12"/>
							in the government. A city ought to have one government, not several. Pulling and
							hauling, deadlocks, friction and delays, trading of influence and the need of a boss
							to hold the ramshackle together and make it progress--all result from two-headed
							government.</item>
					</list>
					<p>Putting a chief executive under continuous control of a responsible group of men
						abolishes these evils. A moment's reflection will show that it is the universal plan in
						corporations and in all associations employing paid servants. It is likewise a standard
						plan in governments outside of the United States.</p>

					<p>In foreign countries the parliament elects and controls the prime minister, who in turn
						controls the administration. The <hi rend="i">magistrat</hi> of a German city, with
						general power of appointment over the whole administration, is hired by the council and
						subject to continuous control by it.</p>
					<p>I believe the best way to go about getting this idea into practice is by giving
						encouragement to the widespread adoption of the Sumter plan. This plan, if successful in
						cities, will in time, spread to counties and even to states.</p>

					<milestone unit="typography" n="____________" rend="center"/>

					<p>The City Manager Plan itself and its advantages over the ordinary Commission Plan have
						been set forth by Mr. Childs and Mr. Gilbertson. Proportional reresentation has been
						briefly explained by Mr. Tyson. What I have to say is on the combination of the two into
						what, in my work for the P. R. League, I have been calling, for short, the
						Representative Council Plan.</p>
					<p>It will help, perhaps, to clear up the confusion in many people's minds to admit at the
						outset that under the Commission Plan in its original form, that is, where the
						commissioners are the actual heads of administrative departments, instead of the
						responsible supervisors of a manager to whom all purely administrative work is
						delegated, the "block vote"--that is, the present system, under which every voter votes
						for all the commissioners--is actually preferable to the proportional system. For under
						the Commission Plan the administrative functions of the commissioners are more important
						than their deliberative functions; and to make five <hi rend="i">administrative</hi>
						officials representative of the various interests and opinions of the community would be
						an absurdity. Under the City Manager Plan, however, which provides for the delegation of
						administrative work by the commission or council to the city manager, there is not only
						no objection to electing the council so as to make it reflect truly the community's
						various interests and opinions but every advantage in doing so. The City Manager Plan
						with proportional representation, then, seems to be just what we have been looking for
						so long in this country, the plan that combines with the highest efficiency genuine
						democracy.</p>
					<p>For the highest efficiency we must put the chief administrative official, as well as
						subordinate officials of the same sort, on a professional basis, which means simply that
						we must leave his selection and his indefinite retention to some person or body that is
						in a position to examine his work closely and therefore judge of it intelligently, and
						that we must also take the matter out of politics not by incessantly harping on the
						desirability of doing so but by <hi rend="i">relieving him of all except purely
						administrative duties</hi>. That is not saying, you will notice, or even implying,
						that "the people cannot be trusted to choose" the chief administrator: it is implying
						merely that they are <hi rend="i">not in a position</hi> to do so to advantage, and that
						if the official in question is given the veto and other policy-determining functions,
						neither the people nor anybody else can be expected, no matter how well they realize the
						advantage of experience in administrative work, to do anything but oust him as often as
						his <hi rend="i">opinions</hi> are not in conformity with those of the majority. We can
						have the highest efficiency in city government as soon as we are ready to take the steps
						obviously necessary to get it.</p>
					<p>It may be asked why, if the city manager is to be appointed, he should not be appointed
						by the mayor? Well, if what is mean by the term "mayor" here is a chief official having
						both deliberative and executive powers, and elected at the polls, it may be answered
						that he should not exist. In so far as such a mayor is a mere administrator, he should
						be supplanted, as Mr. Childs has shown, by the city manager himself. And in so far as he
						is a deliberative or policy-determining official, he should be supplanted by the council
						as soon as that body has been made, by the application of proportional representation to
						its election, truly representative of all the voters.</p>
					<p>Moreover, quite aside from the fact that there should be no mayor of the old-fashioned
						sort to whom the appointment of the city manager could be entrusted, there is every
						advantage in giving the responsibility for his appointment and his retention to the
						council. Instead of changing completely with the turn-over of a few votes at any
						election, as would frequently happen in the case of a mayor elected at the polls, the
						council will change in complexion only as fast as, and to the degree that, the whole
						body of voters changes. Thus the council is the most stable basis for the managership to
						rest on. Moreover, if the manager is not to be elected by all the voters, and if he is
						to be kept in office indefinitely so long as he is satisfactory to those who appoint
						him, as is required in the interest of efficiency, it is obviously important, in the
						interest of democracy, to entrust his appointment and his retention to the one <pb
							id="VAB8218-014" n="14"/> body in the government that can be made truly representative
						of the whole electorate.</p>
					<p>Efficiency and democracy, then--the two fundamental requirements of the ideal city
						government--are satisfied by the City Manager Plan with proportional representation,
						provided only that proportional representation itself can accomplish all that its
						advocates maintain. In undertaking now to settle that question I shall assume that the
						particular system of proportional representation in question is the Hare. That is the
						system successfully in use for the election of the Parliament of Tasmania and the Senate
						of South Africa; it has recently been approved by the British Parliament for the Senate
						and the House proposed for Ireland; and it is now receiving powerful support for the
						election of the councils of British municipalities. I shall assume also that in our
						cities that system would be carried out under the provisions recommended in the
						publications of the American P. R. League, which are printed in full at the end of this
						article.</p>
					<p>That the Hare system focuses the voters of a community into a representative body
						almost as perfectly as a burning-glass focuses the rays of a sunbeam into a point is
						pretty clear to anybody who fully grasps the fundamental difference between the Hare or
						any other proportional system and our present one. That difference concerns simply the
						nature of a "constituency." Under our present system a member's constituency is defined
						arbitrarily as all the voters who happen to live within a certain district--in spite of
						the fact that from thirty to seventy per cent. of them may actually have voted against
						him either in the final election'or in the primaries. Under a proportional system a
						member's constituency is defined as <hi rend="i">enough voters, unanimous in his
						support, to deserve to send him in</hi>. This fundamental difference is like the
						difference between the two sides of a barn the ridge-pole of which happens to form the
						continental divide. Turn a pailful of water down one side of the barn, and it flows into
						the Pacific; turn it down the other, and it flows into the Gulf of Mexico. Define the
						constituency of a member of a deliberative body as all the voters who happen to live
						inside of a certain line, and you have no choice but to give the entire representation
						of the district to one person in spite of the fact that he may, and often does, more or
						less flagrantly misrepresent from thirty to seventy per cent. of the voters in the
						constituency thus defined; and the aggregate of such misrepresentation in all the
						districts may well be sufficient, in the absence of unusual good luck, to confound the
						very basis of the government. Define a constituency, on the other hand, in terms of <hi
							rend="i"> unanimity of will</hi> instead of in those of mere <hi rend="i">proximity of
							home</hi>, and the result, provided only that the means of attaining it are adequate,
						is the elimination of misrepresentation and the consequent establishment of a basis of
						government that inspired John Stuart Mill "with new and more sanguine hopes respecting
						the future of human society."<ref id="ref_003" target="note_003">*</ref></p>
					<p>The Hare system--or any other good system of proportional representation--is nothing
						but a form of ballot, and a set of rules for counting ballots, that make it easy for the
						voters to build up at a single election--without any primaries whatever--approximately
						equal constituencies each of which is unanimous, under the actual circumstances
						existing, in the desire to support a certain candidate. The specific means
						employed--under the Hare system--are covered by the provisions following this article.
						How effectively they work out can be realized best by seeing an actual election carried
						out and the ballots counted. It is interesting, when the results of such an election
						have been reached, to take up and go over, one by one, the pile of ballots that elects
						any member. Such an examination shows that every ballot in the pile is that of a voter
						who preferred, under the actual circumstances existing, and considering how all the
						other electors had voted, to have his vote go to the support of the member it has
						actually helped to elect.</p>
					<p>This is "effective voting" as applied to the election of representative bodies, and it
						is utterly different from our present system of voting for such bodies by arbitrarily
						defined single-member districts. It provides a basis for government as scientific,
						stable, and democratic as our present representative system--so called--is crude,
						unstable, and conducive to political trickery and corruption. To make a specific
						comparison, at the municipal election of 1909 in Cape Town, South Africa, where our
						present system was used, only 42 per cent. of the votes cast were effective in electing
						members of the council, whereas at the elections of the same year in Johannesburg and
						Pretoria, where the Hare system was used, 96 per cent. and 99 per cent. respectively of
						the ballots cast were effective in electing members.</p>

						<p>To elect a councilman corruptly under the single-member district or ward system it is
							necessary to corrupt only the few voters necessary to turn the scale in a close ward.
							To elect one corruptly under the Hare system it is necessary to corrupt approximately
							as many voters as there would be in a whole ward.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">JUSTICE</head>

						<p>The ward system may be very unjust, for under it the seats in the council are often
							won not by force of voting power but by the tricks of politics: experienced
							politicians can often make of no avail thousands of votes cast by their opponents
							simply by pitting faction against faction in close wards and then swinging the small
							vote necessary to control each. It is only under a system by which each voter's ballot
							is insured its full weight of one when marked in accordance with the real will of the
							voter that we can expect the council to reflect the will of the voters truly. Under
							the ward system a small minority of the voters of the city may control a majority of
							the council. Under the Hare system a majority of the people is sure to elect a
							majority of the council, and yet at the same time every minority group large enough to
							deserve representation gets it.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">CONTINUITY OF POLICY</head>

						<p>Under the ward system the personnel of the council may be changed considerably by the
							change of a few voters in a few close wards. Under that system, therefore, there is no
							assurance that the complexion of the council will not change abruptly when there is no
							marked change of opinion on the part of the voters of the city generally. Under the
							Hare system each councilman is sure of his seat so long as he remains the candidate
							really preferred by one of the full constituencies of the city. If a councilman is not
							re-elected, it is only because those who elected him formerly now really prefer some
							one else. The complexion of the council changes, in other words, only as fast as the
							interests and opinions of the community change, or as fast as councilmen are found to
							be other than they were thought to be when formerly elected. The Hare system makes
							possible, therefore, that continuity of policy whch is absolutely essential to
							consistent and orderly progress, for it insures the retention in the council of
							experienced leaders until leaders more truly representative of the community are
							discovered.</p>

						<head rend="center">POLITICAL APATHY</head>

						<p>Under the ward system political apathy is fostered in a ward where one party or
							fraction is almost sure to win with many votes to spare. For in such a ward a voter of
							the leading party knows that his vote will probably have no effect on the result; and
							a voter of any other party knows in respect to his vote the same thing. A system that
							causes thousands of votes to be thus "thrown away" at every election is sure to breed
							apathy among large classes of voters. The cure for political apathy is not continual
							exhortation to "do your duty as a citizen and go to the polls," but <hi rend="i">
							making each ballot count one towards the make-up of the council, even when the
							voter has dared to record on it his real will</hi>.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">CRANKS</head>

						<p>It may be asked whether the Hare system would not permit any crank who could muster
							more than a tenth of the voters to his support to get a seat in council of nine?
							Certainly. But that means neither more nor less than that it is fair. The implication
							of those who ask this question, namely that the system would fill the council with
							cranks, is absurd. Clearly the number of cranks in the council would correspond to the
							number of crank-supporters in the city. It is only in a city full of crank-supporters,
							therefore, that the council would be full of cranks. Moreover, the thing works both
							ways: besides insuring a seat to any candidate having the necessary support whom you
							might consider a crank or "undesirable," it would insure a seat there also to any
							person of exceptional intelligence, education, or equipment who could get the same
							support.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">PARTY LINES</head>

						<p>Would the Hare system divide the voters into solid factions and interests? It would
							do just the opposite. The ward system has kept the voters divided into factions and
							parties meaningless in municipal elections. The Hare system would set the voter free
							to cross all factional lines, including national party lines, if he wanted to; but it
							would make him free also to vote according to any lines, whether those of the most
							temporary sort or those of national party divisions, which he wanted to follow at the
							particular election in question. It is the cramping restrictions of the present plan
							of electing representatives by plurality (or majority) vote in single geographical
							constituencies that maintain parties and factions rigidly where they would disappear
							at once or change as municipal issues changed under a <pb id="VAB8218-016" n="16"/>
							system that allowed the voters to form their groups freely by means of the ballots
							themselves, <hi rend="i">each one of which would be insured full effectiveness under whatever
							circumstances of grouping might arise.</hi> Under the Hare system national party lines
							would not persist in city elections except in so far as the voters really wanted them
							to.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">DISTRICT REPRESENTATION</head>

						<p>Have not geographical districts a right to representation as such? Certainly--<hi
								rend="i">to precisely the extent that the voters want such representation</hi>. Any
							system of election, therefore, that prevented a voter from giving as much weight to
							the geographical proximity of a candidate as he wanted to would be unreasonable. But
							the Hare system does not do that, and it has the advantage also of not forcing voters
							by the thousand to be "represented" by men they are utterly opposed to simply because
							a constituency has been defined as all the voters, no matter how diverse in interests
							and opinions, who happen to live within a certain line.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">SUPPOSED DIFFICULTY IN VOTING</head>

						<p>Is it hard for uneducated voters to vote a Hare ballot? It is not. On this point
							there is conclusive evidence in official documents, notably the testimony of the Agent
							General of Tasmania in the Blue Book of the British Government designated
							"Miscellaneous No. 3, 1907."</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">THE TITLE OF MAYOR</head>

						<p>Is a city to have no mayor if it adopts the City Manager Plan with proportional
							representation? By all means let it have a mayor--if there is no danger that the
							retention of the title will mean the retention of the official we now call by that
							name. Give the title of mayor, if you wish, to the person selected by the council as
							its president or chairman, for that is the person who should represent the dignity and
							the hospitality of the city. And let that person also, as the Lockport bill puts it,
							"be recognized as the official head of the city by the courts for the purpose of the
							advice of civil process and by the Governor for the purposes of the military law."</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">THE RECALL</head>

						<p>Should the Recall be made applicable to the city manager under this plan of
							government? Preferably not, for there is nothing to be gained by giving the council
							the least loophole for excuses in case the manager whom it is keeping in office is
							inefficient or otherwise unsatisfactory. There is no objection, however, to making the
							Recall applicable to the council itself. It must not be made applicable to members of
							the council separately, of course, for that would be utterly inconsistent with the
							principle on which the body is made up--the principle that any man deserves a seat who
							has a whole constituency behind him, even if every other voter in the city is against
							him: it must be made applicable to the council <hi rend="i">as a whole</hi>. There
							need be no fear that any member who ought to remain in the council will lose his seat
							at such a recall election: the system of election itself will take care of that: the
							only members dropped will be those who ought to be dropped because they no longer have
							the support of constituency of voters. In this connection it may be added that as
							there is no objection, under the Hare system, to frequent elections--that system
							itself assuring stability to the council--a simple solution of the problem of the
							Recall in respect to a council elected by that system is to provide that the regular
							elections for the council shall be at intervals as short as one would think of making
							the interval required between a regular election and a recall election. With regular
							elections for the council annually, say, provisions for recall elections applying to
							that body might be considered unnecessary. If longer intervals between the regular
							elections were preferred, provisions for recall elections applying to all the seats at
							once should be included in the city's charter.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">A SLIGHT PRACTICAL OBJECTION</head>

						<p>Under the Hare system is it not necessary to have all the ballots, after the counting
							of first choices at the precincts, brought together to a central place for the
							completion of the count? It is, and one must admit that this is a slight practical
							objection to the system. Wherever the system is thoroughly understood, of course, an
							appreciation of its advantages will make this slight objection seem not worth
							considering. Wherever however, the public cannot be educated sufficiently, and the
							objection mentioned seems an insuperable obstacle to the introduction of the Hare
							system, a simple list system of proportional representation, such as that explained on
							pages 14-17 of the American P. R. League Pamphlet No. 3, is to be recommended.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">"PREFERENTIAL VOTING" AND<lb/> PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION</head>

						<p>Just what is the advantage of proportional represent tion for the election of the
							council over what is usuall called "preferential voting?" Preferential voting, as the
							term is commonly used, means preferential <hi rend="i">majority</hi> voting, that is,
							the use of a ballot on which the <pb id="VAB8218-017" n="17"/> voter can express his
							will fully instead of very limitedly in an election intended to range the majority
							against the minority. As the use of a ballot that allows such a full expression of the
							voter's will, that is, of a "preferential ballot," for such an object does all that
							both primary and final election do under the old system, and does it better, there can
							be no question but that the preferential ballot is an essential feature of any
							rational or effective voting having that object in view. But when the object of voting
							is not that at all, but the building up of unanimous constituencies, as it
							unquestionably should be when a <hi rend="i">representative</hi> body is being
							elected, the mere use of the preferential ballot <hi rend="i">in connection with 
							single-member districts that make unanimous constituencies impossible</hi> is very
							far from being rational or effective voting. When this is the object in view, the
							preferential ballot itself should be used, but the rules for counting it should be
							unanimous-constituency or "proportional" rules instead of majority rules.</p>
						<p>Fifty years hence it will be obvious to everybody that the preferential or adequate
							ballot should be used in all voting whatsoever, and that when it is used, officially
							supervised primary elections are useless; but it will be equally obvious that there
							are two objects of voting, quite distinct from each other, the making of decisions, in
							which majority voting is in order, and the making up of a body fit to make them on
							behalf of all the people, in which majority voting is quite out of order.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">COMPARISON WITH THE ORDINARY<lb/> COMMISSION PLAN</head>

						<p>This brings us back to the comparison of the ordinary Commission Plan with the City
							Manager Plan with proportional representation. Under the former, since the
							commissioners are primarily administrators--being a sort of executive committee of the
							majority--they should be elected at large by the majority system of voting, as in fact
							they are. But when they are elected thus, the city is left without the services of any
							body that even pretends to be representative of all the voters. The ordinary
							Commission Plan, therefore, is weaker than the City Manager Plan with proportional
							representation not only in having its chief administrators on a non-professional
							basis, which must make the highest efficiency in administration impossible, but in
							depriving the city altogether of the services of a truly representative body composed
							of more or less experienced leaders of public opinion.</p>

						<q rend="blockquote">
							<p>HARE PLAN OF PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION, NOMINATION AND ELECTION PROVISIONS</p>
							<p rend="right">Revised July, 1913.</p>
							<p>Section 1. Nominations of candidates for the council shall be by petition, signed
								by electors (who have signed no other petition to nominate a candidate for the
								council at the same election) to the number, in municipalities of not more than ten
								thousand inhabitants, of three per cent of the number of electors who voted at the
								last preceding regular municipal election; to the number, in municipalities of more
								than ten thousand but not more than twenty-five thousand inhabitants of two per cent
								of the number of electors who voted at the last preceding regular municipal
								election; and to the number, in municipalities of more than twenty-five thousand
								inhabitants, of one and a half per cent of the number of electors who voted at the
								last preceding regular municipal election; provided, however, that in no case shall
								the number required be more than two hundred.</p>
							<p>Each such petition shall be signed, filed, and verified in the manner prescribed by
								general law, shall contain the signed consent of the candidate, and shall be filed
								with the election authorities at least thirty days prior to the election.</p>
							<p>Section 2. The ballots used in all elections provided for in this act shall be
								without party marks or designations. The names of candidates on such ballots shall
								be printed in rotation<ref id="ref_005" target="note_005">*</ref> as follows:</p>
							<p>The ballots shall be printed in as many series as there are candidates for the
								council. The whole number of ballots to be printed shall be divided by the number of
								series and the quotient so obtained shall be the number of ballots in each
								series.</p>
							<note id="note_005"><ref target="ref_005">*</ref>Of course these provisions for
								rotation of the names on the ballots are not an essential part of the plan. If
								rotation is not desired, put the words "alphabetical order" instead of the word
								"rotation" here and omit the passage that follows as far as the words "The ballots
								shall in all other respects."</note>
							<p>In printing the first series of ballots the names of candidates for the council
								shall be arranged in alphabetical order. After printing the first series the first
								name in the list of candidates shall be placed last in such list and the next series
								printed, and the process shall be so repeated until each name in the list of
								candidates shall have been printed first an equal number of times. The ballots so
								printed shall then be combined in tablets, so as to have the fewest possible ballots
								having the same order of names printed thereon together in the same tablet. The
								ballots shall in all other respects conform as nearly as may be to the ballots
								prescribed by the general election laws of the state.</p>
							<p>The form of the ballot shall be as follows:</p>
							<p rend="center">[See next page]</p>
							<p>Section 3. The numerals thus marked on the ballot shall be understood to mean that
								the voter wishes his vote to be effective in the election of his highest preference
								possible under the rules, a candidate whose name is marked with a lower number being
								always preferred to one whose name is marked with a higher number and the latter to
								one whose name is not marked at all, and that he desires his ballot, in case it
								appears on any count that it is not needed by, or cannot under the rules be
								effective in the election of, that candidate for whom it has been or would be
								counted, to be transferred to another candidate in accordance with his preferences
								marked thereon.</p>
							<p>Section 4. The ballots shall first be sorted and counted at the several voting
								precincts according to the first choices of the voters. The valid ballots so cast
								for each candidate shall be sorted into two groups, that of valid ballots on which
								the voter's second choice is clearly indicated and that of valid ballots on which
								his second choice is not clearly indicated. Each such group shall be tied up by
								itself and properly <pb id="VAB8218-018" n="18"/> marked on the outside, and the two
								for each candidate shall then be tied up in one bundle which shall also be properly
								marked on the outside. All the bundles thus made up at a precinct, together with the
								invalid ballots and a record of all the ballots cast at the precinct, showing the
								number of invalid ballots, the number of valid ballots, the total number of
								first-choice ballots for each candidate, and the number of ballots in each of the
								two groups of first-choice ballots received by each candidate, shall be forwarded to
								the Board of Deputy State Supervisors of Elections or the Board of Deputy State
								Supervisors and Inspectors of Elections,<ref id="ref_006" target="note_006">*</ref>
								as directed by that Board, and the counting of the ballots shall proceed under its
								direction.</p>
							<p>Section 5. First-choice votes for all candidates shall be added and tabulated as
								the first count.</p>
							<p>Section 6. The whole number of valid ballots shall then be divided by a number
								greater by one than the number of seats to be filled. The next whole number larger
								than the quotient thus obtained shall be the quota or constituency.</p>
							<p>Section 7. All candidates the number of whose votes on the first count is equal to
								or greater than the quota shall then be declared elected.</p>
							<p>Section 8. All votes obtained by any candidate in excess of the quota shall be
								termed the surplus of that candidate.</p>
							<p>Section 9. The surpluses of those candidates who have a surplus shall be
								successively transferred, beginning with the largest surplus and proceeding to the
								smallest, each ballot of the surplus being transferred to and added to the votes of
								that continuing candidate for whom a preference is indicated on the ballot.</p>
							<p>Section 10. "Ballots capable of transfer" means ballots from which the preference
								of the voter for some continuing candidate can be clearly ascertained. "Continuing
								candidates" means candidates who have not been declared elected or defeated.</p>
							<p>Section 11. The particular ballots to be transferred as the surplus of any
								candidate shall be taken as they happen to come, without selection, from such of his
								ballots as are capable of transfer, and the order in which those ballots shall be
								transferred shall be that in which they happen to come, without selection. All the
								ballots not so transferred as surplus shall be set aside as effective in the
								election of such candidate.</p>
							<p>Section 12. After the transfer of all surpluses, the votes standing to the credit
								of all the candidates shall be counted and tabulated as the second count.</p>
							<p>Section 13. After the tabulation of the second count (or after that of the first
								count if no candidate received a surplus on the first) the candidate lowest on the
								poll as it then stands shall be declared defeated and all his ballots capable of
								transfer shall be transferred to the continuing candidates, each ballot being
								transferred to and added to the votes of that continuing candidate preferred by the
								voter. After the transfer of these ballots a fresh count and tabulation shall be
								made. In this manner candidates shall be successively declared defeated and their
								ballots capable of transfer transferred to continuing candidates and a fresh count
								and tabulation made. Each time the candidate to be declared defeated shall be the
								one lowest on the poll at the last preceding count.</p>
							<p>Section 14. Whenever in the transfer of a surplus or of the ballots of a defeated
								candidate the votes of any candidate shall equal the quota, he shall immediately be
								declared elected and no further transfer to him shall be made.</p>
							<p>Section 15. When candidates to the number of the seats to be filled have been
								declared elected, all other candidates shall be declared defeated and the count
								shall be at an end; and when the number of continuing candidates shall be reduced to
								the number of seats to be filled, those candidates <note id="note_006"><ref
										target="ref_006">*</ref>In some states the proper officials would have some
									other title. The alternative title given is intended to be correct for all
									municipalities in Ohio.</note> shall be declared elected and the count shall be at
								an end; and in this case the ballots of the last candidate defeated need not be
								transferred.</p>
							<p>Section 16. If at any count two or more candidates at the bottom of the poll have
								the same number of votes, that candidate shall first be declared defeated who was
								lowest at the next preceding count at which their votes were different. Should it
								happen that the votes of these candidates are equal to each other on all counts,
								they shall be declared defeated successively from the younger to the older.<ref
									id="ref_007" target="note_007">**</ref></p>
							<p>Section 17. No ballot shall be counted in such a way as to make it effective in the
								election of more than one candidate.</p>
							<p>Section 18. Upon each tabulation a count shall be kept of those ballots which have
								not been used in the election of some candidate and which are not capable of
								transfer, under the designation "Non-Transferable Ballots."</p>
							<p>Section 19. Upon each tabulation a count shall be kept of the invalid ballots; but
								no ballot shall be declared invalid except one on which the first choice of the
								voter cannot be clearly ascertained. A ballot marked with a cross opposite one name
								but with no other mark shall be treated exactly as if it had been marked with the
								figure 1 opposite the same name but with no other mark.</p>
							<p>Section 20. So far as may be consistent with good order and with convenience in the
								counting and transferring of the ballots, the public, representatives of the press,
								and especially the candidates themselves, shall be afforded every facility for being
								present and witnessing these operations.</p>
							<note id="note_007"><ref target="ref_007">**</ref>For the last twelve words may be

						the concurrence of the mayor and two-thirds of the aldermanic board, some other
						competent person may be appointed as the head of this department, but such appointment
						shall not be good for longer than the calendar year for which the appointment is made.
						The mayor of the city is hereby especially charged with the duty of supervising and
						directing the city manager in accordance With the provisions of the city charter as
						hereby amended, and in accordance with the ordinances, resolutions and regulations and
						the line of policy adopted and determined upon by the city council, and the city manager

						duties during such time, or at his option, the mayor may designate some properly
