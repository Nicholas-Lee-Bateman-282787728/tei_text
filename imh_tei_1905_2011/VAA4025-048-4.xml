            <p>Early in January, 1848, the Indiana politicians met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to consider the coming presidential campaign. Neither at the state convention of the
                    Whigs nor of the Democrats was any effort made to diagnose the general state of political
                    health—both adopted a "wait and see" attitude.</p>
            <p>The Whigs felt they had reason to be optimistic, for the Polk administration had aroused a
                    respectable number of citizens of the state to cry out against the political crimes committed
                    against the Northwest. The Whig position resolved itself into the task of finding a suitable
                    candidate, which was no easy job for a political party feeling the stress of sectional attitudes. A
                    few of the party members expressed a willingness to lay aside local prejudices so the party could
                    unite upon some distinguished individual,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> but this offer in each case was
                    hastily withdrawn when a candidate was suggested who possessed sectional attitudes that were not
                    common to the Indiana Whigs.</p>
            <p>The party had enjoyed great success in 1840 with a military man, so it was rather natural that
                    Schuyler Colfax sought out the opinions of his friends as to the availability of Zachary Taylor. As
                    early as May, 1847, the <placeName>

                    history of the campaign of 1840 is not yet written, but it was more than Harrison's
                    military fame that elected him. The corruptions of Van Buren's administration, the
                    feeling of frontier life and frontier settlement, represented as it was in that campaign by the
                    National Emblem of the Log Cabin (for all our people East West North &amp; South were once Log
                    Cabin men) did much to elect Harrison. Besides he was somewhat of a statesman and a finished
                    scholar. Do you now know that we are triumphantly pointed to his Bolivar letter as we did to the

            <p>The same politician, Orth, after a trip through the East in the fall of 1847, had found further

                    Politicians to run with success any ultra slavite."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not all the Whigs shared Orth's opinions, however, for a few days before the state
                    convention was to be held, the Whigs of <placeName>

            <p>When the convention met, the Whig politicians proved reluctant to endorse any candidate. After they
                    had halted the incipient Taylor movement, the delegates decided to allow the national convention to
                    pass upon the merits of the various candidates, preferring to bide their time with a compromise
                    ticket that sought to satisfy the desires of all the elements of the party. The <placeName>

            <p>As the time for the national convention drew near, the Hoosier Whigs were still undecided as to a
                    presidential candidate. Winfield Scott, John McLean, Henry Clay, and Zachary Taylor were all being
                    considered. Each had availability and each had disabilities, as far as the Hoosiers were concerned.

                    the party intrigues, yet giving every appearance of being a substantial Whig. McLean was supported
                    by John Defrees, editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana State Journal</hi>, the central Whig organ, but
                    there were others who felt that McLean was too far removed from the

                    with certain defeat awaiting us here—and can we under these circumstances make the

            <p>The dilemma of the Whig party in Indiana, as one politician saw it, offered an interesting example of
                    the complexities of the political scene in the federal union. The question became one of choice
                    between national success or local advantage for the Whig party, for it seem inevitable that one
                    level of the political hierarchy would have to be sacrificed to benefit another. Within the state,
                    if party success was achieved by <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>, for example, the factions outside the circle of; his supporters would lose their
                    relative position of influence among the Hoosier Whigs. Orth deliberated over the problem and wrote:
                    "The Legislature of next winter has many important offices to fill, US
                    Senator—Prest. of State Bank—secretary of State &amp;c &amp;c. We can
                    secure the Legislature if we have the right man as our candidate for Prest. but even then it will
                    require the utmost exertions. With <placeName>

                    </placeName> I am sorry to confess it, we would be in a hopeless minority. Shall we then risk our
                    state elections &amp; ascendency for the slight hope of carrying N.Y. … Again, the
                    younger portion of the Whigs regard the peculiar friends of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> as old Hunkers, who are to share all the 'spoils of
                    office'—and thus they are deprived of one great incentive to
                    action—and their action, young, vigorous, &amp; enthusiastic, gives to a campaign
                    much of its spirit &amp; eclat."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

                    </placeName>, the Indiana delegates on the first ballot gave nine of their twelve votes to Scott; on

                    spirit—apathy seemed to prevail everywhere, and it was up to the Democrats to arouse the
                    electorate to show a little enthusiasm. The accomplishments of the Twenty-ninth Congress had had
                    little effect on the people: it had stirred up some old problems and brought out some new ones, but
                    even the question of slavery (which was distasteful to Indiana Democrats), rivers and harbors (which
                    was still unsolved), tariff (a party victory), expansion (which certainly had not been a complete
                    failure from the Democratic point of view), patronage (which both locally and nationally was in the
                    hands of the party)—not one of these had evoked much reaction. The approval of Cam for
                    the Democratic nomination was in the best tradition of party loyalty by a state organization that
                    had not found much to get excited about.</p>

                    contrary to their hopes, there was no wholesale defection among either the Whigs or Democrats, and

                    greatest proponents of Free Soilism were men who had long been associated with the antislavery
                    movement. The state convention, which met July 26, 1848, drew up resolutions supporting Van Buren

            <p>An examination of the Free Soil leaders of the state reveals the character of the party organization

                    remained the task of naming a new senator. The candidates were asked the following questions by the
                    members of the legislature: 1) Do you believe that Congress possesses the power under the
                    Constitution, to prohibit slavery in the newly acquired territories of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>

            <p>Although the Democrats had a clear majority in the legislature, Whigs and Free Soilers were fishing
                    about for a moderate Democrat whom they could support. The strategy was summed up by one <placeName>

                    who are really so, to make a choice. Law undoubtedly approximates nearest to correct principles, but
                    if the Whigs should combine with his friends and elect him, it is probable that in his efforts to
                    restore himself to a good standing with his party, <list type="footnotes">

                    a joint resolution declaring the existent free status of the territories. He would not support the

            <p>Governor James Whitcomb and Edward A. Hannegan both agreed that Congress possessed the power to
                    prohibit slavery in the territories. Whitcomb further agreed to use his influence and vote for the

                    </placeName>. Hannegan, however, replied: "Upon all questions of this character, I have
                    ever held my final action open and liable to the control of circumstances. In making the pledges you
                    require I should be completely hampered, and in such a way as might leave me the subject of an
                    awkward dilemma. It might bring me directly in conflict with the duty of the Representative to obey
                    the Instructions of his constituency; a duty which I have ever held as a cardinal point of political
                    faith. These instructions, to be binding, must be given a majority. Upon the subject involved, in

            </p>
            <p>It was over the manner in which the territories were to be kept free that conflict arose among the
                    parties. Little concern was exhibited in Indiana over the question of whether to allow slavery to go
                    into the territories; Hoosiers put the emphasis on the method of prohibition. There was, for
                    example, the problem of interpreting the phrase "every constitutional and legal
                    means" which Whitcomb had used in his pledge. Martin L. Bundy, speaking for the Whigs,
                    questioned the meaning of this: "Well, the Governor has fought hard for the station, and
                    endured 'the winter of his discontent' with commendable fortitude, as well as
                    the 'wear and tear' of conscience and political consistency, to which he had
                    been subjected by the Free Soilers; and now we shall see what 'legal and constitutional
                    means' do mean, when the object is to exclude slavery from New <placeName>

                    and ought to remain so'; or whether it be that bold and intelligible expression of the
                    illustrious Jefferson, in his memorable Ordinance that 'slavery shall never &amp;t
                        there.'"<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This split in the legislature between the Whigs and Democrats over the question of slavery extension
                    brought the controversy into the sphere of state politics. The day after the legislature convened,
                    Jacob B. Julian of <placeName>

                    representatives in Congress to pass a "Wilmot Proviso." The Democrats, hoping to
                    gain time to amend the resolution, refused to have it read a second time. This was accomplished by a
                    strict party vote. On Saturday of the same week, the Whigs again brought the resolution to the floor
                    of the legislature; again the Democrats prevented the Whigs <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>Immediately following the election of Whitcomb, the committee reported on several joint resolutions
                    dealing with slavery, all variations on the same theme—the territories acquired by <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> were now free and ought to remain free, The committee, which was packed with Democrats,
                    argued that it was more expedient for Congress to pass a declaratory resolution than a prohibitory
                    law: either would serve the same practical purpose of deterring slaveholders from carrying slaves
                    into the territories, but a resolution would be much less offensive to the South than a Wilmot
                    Proviso. The committee took the position that: "while a prohibitory law is the appropriate
                    form, in the we of slave territory, as for example, the North Western Territory, a declaratory
                    resolution is the proper one in the case of free territory, like New <placeName>

                    </placeName>, in the first case, slavery has to be excluded, in the second, it has no existence, and
                    if any action be necessary, it can be only a public declaration of that fact, from an authorized
                        source."<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After voting down a motion to recommit with a proviso, the joint resolution passed the House by a
                    vote of 80 to 16. The minority was represented by those who could not compromise their views on the
                    question. Twelve of those dissenters had previously voted for the proviso resolution.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>After a joint resolution had passed the Senate with amendments, it was laid on the table in the House

                    action concerning the resolution in the legislative records.</p>
            <p>The legislature's actions show the effects of the reshuffling of the political cards after
                    the election of 1848. The Free Soil flurry of the past summer, although of small proportions,
                    continued to blow, ruffling the electorate, and party politicians had to be extremely careful, lest
                    it get out of hand and create havoc in the party organization. If it could be kept under control,
                    there was the possibility of political capital in the Free Soil issue for the vote-getting
                    politicians of the state. There <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The Democracy in Indiana, in its new position as the Party out of power nationally, was rather quick
                    to utilize the antislavery feeling in the state. Early in 1849, the party began testing a new
                    formula. The <placeName>

                    the election of Taylor had made the extension of slavery possible, and hinted that the Whigs and
                    slaveholders had formed an alliance. The logical move, the observation continued, would be for the
                    Indiana Democrats and Free Soilers to wash their hands of such interests and combinations.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> The Democracy, for political purposes at least, was ready to cast off from
                    its national partners and become a sectional party representing more local interests, and the Free

                    nominated for governor Joseph A. Wright, a onetime bitter opponent of the proviso, who was now a
                    moderate on the issue. Wright, the church leader and temperance advocate as well as
                    colonization-society leader, varied his tune to meet the situation.</p>
            <p>The Indiana, and Northwest, Democrats, feeling that the selection of Cass solved the territorial
                    question, turned their attention to the problem of winning back the party deserters of 1848. With
                    this in mind, John L. Robinson, in Congress, attacked his southern colleagues and became a supporter
                    of the Wilmot Proviso. The Jesse Bright lieutenant boasted that he had voted to strike out the

                    meager majorities that the moral effect was that of a defeat. And why this desertion? Not because of
                    the political principles of the opposing candidate, General Taylor were more consonant with their

            <p>While the Indiana Democrats were accusing their southern colleagues of party disloyalty for the sake
                    of their peculiar institutions, they hoped to lure those of Free Soil tendencies back into the
                    party. It is doubtful if the Democratic leaders believed that they could capture the abolitionist
                    core of the Free Soil party—they were interested in the fringe group of ex-Whigs and
                    ex-Democrats. Compounded of party discontent as well as political expediency, this move of the
                    Democrats to proselyte the Free Soilers became more and more vigorous, and soon was so filled with
                    antislavery sentiment that the Whigs denounced their opponents for this rather strange turn in the
                    political scene. Said the <hi rend="i">State Journal</hi> of its Democratic rival: "The <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> now begins to talk of 'freedom' and
                    'southern dictation' as glibly as though to such language it had long been
                    accustomed. It does not sound beautifully from the lips of those who bowed so submissively to
                    'Southern dictation' and supported Mr. Polk for the Presidency—and
                    who bowed still lower to the same dictation when they supported General Cass, who sold himself to
                    the South! Then how harmoniously it sounds from those who aided in annexing <placeName>

                    'Southern dictation' who have been its most abject worshippers, and now ask to

            </p>
            <p>The following day, the Democratic organ explained its stand: "No matter how derelict the
                    Democratic party may have been in the past—even if all the Journal alleges were
                    true—now it has taken ground for freedom … why should it be assailed?
                    … Why can not it expand its grasp sufficiently wide upon this question to take in <hi rend="i">all the people of the West</hi>, who begin to feel upon their own limbs, the galling

            </p>
            <p>The Whigs were determined to bring in their share of the vote. As the party in power nationally, they
                    found themselves being attacked as the party of the slaveholder. In an attempt to remove the stigma
                    of their peculiar political position, the Whigs began to ridicule the Democracy's Free
                    Soil sentiment. Schuyler Colfax, during the congressional campaign of 1849, warned his readers that
                    northern Democratic Free Soilism was a mere dragnet for Locofocoism, and the <hi rend="i">State
                        Journal</hi> raised the question of gain in voting Free Soil: "By doing so you may
                    prevent the election of men who agree with you on every single political question, including the
                    question you place above all others. Is it the part of wisdom thus to act?"<hi rend="sup">36</hi> The problem resolved itself again into the matter of trying to hold divergent forces
                    together. The Hoosier Whigs were now feeling the sectional pull in the national party.</p>
            <p>An interesting situation developed as a result of party discontent. Caleb B. Smith and his
                    brother-in-law, Samuel W. Parker, both ardent supporters of Taylor in 1848, had long been the Whig
                    rulers in the Whitewater Valley, a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> stronghold. Smith, in 1849, hoped for an appointment in the new Whig administration,
                    and although he was one of those frequently mentioned for a cabinet position, he was passed by.
                    Whether it was a result of this disappointment, or whether railroad building offered him a brighter
                    future is not known, but at any rate, he withdrew from politics. As a result, Smith's
                    brother-in-law, Parker, became the Whig candidate in the district for Congress.</p>
            <p>Parker's opponent was George W. Julian, who represented a coalition of Independent Whigs,
                    Free Soilers, and Democrats. Julian, a former Whig, had been socially as well as politically
                    ostracized by his erstwhile friends after his Free Soil venture the previous year. He was deserted
                    by even his brother, who dissolved their law partnership during the hot campaign summer and joined
                    those who hurled charges of abolitionism at Julian.</p>

            <p>Thus the campaign was carried on by Democrats, who could not hope to win by themselves, joined with
                    Free Soilers and independent Whigs. The canvass revived all the campaign oratory of 1848. Parker,
                    the Whig opponent, attempted to outdistance Julian by declaring that he was no
                    "yearling"; he was an abolitionist of twenty-years standing. When the ballots were
                    counted, the fusion candidate, Julian, had won by 153 votes.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The significance of this campaign lay in its illustration of how the efforts of the politically
                    discontented were able to overturn a political stronghold. The Taylor Whigs alone were left in the
                    party fold, while those unwilling to follow its leadership took refuge in a coalition that was more
                    acceptable to the Hoosier political climate. The national party thus did not satisfy local
                    requirements. Whether either the Whig remnant or the coalition would be as strong and as durable as
                    the original remained to be tested. At any rate, the split had made it possible for the Whitewater
                    Democrats, who in the past had had little vote-getting success, to get into power. The antislavery
                    issue had weakened the opposition.</p>

                    a cotton mill was founded in this river town which was expected to link the West and the South

                    was abolitionism, and although he deprecated the extension of slavery, he saw no reason why the
                    southern states should be dragooned into the same opinion! On the other hand, he stated:
                    "If the South desires by any measures to extend slavery beyond its present limits, she is
                    not only unwise, but is destined to a bitter disappointment—the West will resist it with
                    the same energy that she would any interferences by the North with Southern institutions, and

            <p>This journal demanded that Indiana's representatives be practical men, concerned with more

                    the sectional aspects of slavery into the political controversies of the day: "nothing but
                    evil can come out of the agitation of that matter, but we have the fullest confidence, that be it
                    settled as it may, the tranquillity of the country will not be disturbed. In our view, it is at most

                    a branch of the national Whigs of Indiana. In addition to them, there were others, including some

                    Instead of knitting the party together, the national questions pulled the party apart, sapping its
                    inner strength.</p>
            <p>To a varying degree, all the parties had taken an excursion into antislavery, with varying degrees of
                    success. The Free Soil party, which in 1848 in a national election had garnered 8,100 votes, found
                    itself out-promised and out—bargained by the Whigs and the Democrats in 1849. The
                    Democrats had managed to win the governorship with a candidate who had previously attacked the
                    Wilmot Proviso, and it had also gathered in nine of the ten congressional seats. The Whigs were
                    reduced to one congressman, Edward W. McGaughey, an old-time campaigner, who was able to defeat
                    Grafton M. Cookerly, a Democrat of <placeName>

            <p>By the time the campaigns, and the year, ended, the Slavery question had been discussed widely both
                    on the stump and in the press. Some Whigs still wanted to avoid the "abstraction"
                    which they felt could only lead to trouble; others felt that the party had not gone far enough in
                    taking a stand to remedy the evil of slavery. As for the Democrats, they had used their promises to
                    make rubble of the state Free Soil party. They, however, had not shed any light on the matter of
                    interpreting the phrase, "every legal and constitutional means," and Martin L.
                    Bundy, who late the year before had expressed concern over these words, probably was still wondering
                    what the Democrats meant by them. Just as the political year had begun with the
                    governor's message, so it ended with these words: "The question is now presented
                    to the American people, whether this territory shall remain free. It cannot be doubted that the
                    response of the people of Indiana to this momentous question, will be in favor of freedom. Whilst we
                    are in favor of freedom, let us exercise that forbearance towards our political brethren of the
                    slave States of this Union, which characterizes the conduct of the patriot and statesman.
                    Nevertheless, it is our imperative duty to assert our rights as members of the same great family,
                    and manfully resist, by all legal and constitutional means, the further advancement of slavery into
                    territory belonging to the General Government. That Congress possesses this power does not admit of
                    a doubt, and the only remaining question to be determined is, whether it is expedient to exercise
                    that right. To decide this question affirmatively, the reflecting mind need only glance over the

            <p>The disturbing influence of the territorial question invaded the halls of the new Congress early in

                    outcome. A speakership and clerk fight in the House held up the organization of Congress, serving as
                    a dire warning to all parties that confusion existed throughout the nation. The southern members of
                    Congress were under surveillance by the Northwest as to their future actions. To their
                    embarrassment, the Democrats who had been denounced by the Whigs as supporters of the old
                    "dough face," Cass, now saw Taylor take the noninterference position as to slavery
                    in the territories. The Free Soilers for their part were quick to claim that the Wilmot Proviso was
                    "ignominiously surrendered to the slave power by its professed champions and

                    of the Federal Whig party. They have faces for all latitudes. Slavery men here, abolitionists there.

                    the kettle calling the pot black. The most important development, however, was that during the

                    both an abandonment of conscientious scruples and of the cardinal principles of our own Declaration

                    actual power in the general government, and it is not surprising that she now beholds, the
                    'sceptre of power departing from Judah,' with painful emotion. Such however is
                    'manifest destiny,' and it cannot be averted, even by the desperate
                    alternative which some of her leaders propose, of a dissolution of the Union." The article
                    concluded by raising the question of whether the Democracy of Indiana and the Northwest would
                    foolishly resign its power into the hands of fanatics North and South.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the recognition of its growing importance as a conciliatory force, the Northwest became more
                    conscious of its power. It no longer suffered under an attitude of neglect, nor cried for sympathy
                    and understanding as it had in the forties when such legislative matters as river and harbor bills
                    had been vetoed. Now the maturing Northwest was demanding its rights and felt that it had the
                    strength to carry out its will. As Jacob P. Chapman, the editor of the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi>,
                    expressed it, the Northwest would resist unjust claims made by any other section "and

            <p>The Whig press also expressed this feeling that the West in the role of peacemaker stood apart from
                    the warring sections. Thompson cried that the West knew only union: "The West is willing to
                    trust both the North and South. Will not the North and South trust her? She will not suffer the
                    rights of either to be invaded."<hi rend="sup">53</hi>

            <p>The <hi rend="i">Economist</hi>, a newspaper that claimed political neutrality, but on occasion
                    leaned to the Whig point of view, also concerned itself with the politicians' quarrel
                    which it felt the people should know about: "Are the people prepared for a dissolution of
                    these States? Is the great West ready to be sold —her independence sacrificed and the
                    tree of her prosperity uprooted by men of extreme views either Northern or Southern? If the Union is

            <p>After Congress had settled down to bargaining, and to listening to the pleas of those who felt a
                    solution could be reached, the Free Soil press, representing those who had been promised so much by
                    the politicians, raised its voice hopelessly. <hi rend="i">"Compromise, Compromise</hi>, is
                    the incessant cry. And is it any wonder that slavery should triumph when freedom has so many

            <p>In Congress, the Indiana representatives felt their way cautiously about the territorial question.
                    Early in the session Fitch had attacked the southern members. Then Willis A. Gorman spoke against
                    the Wilmot Proviso and claimed that it was based upon the wrong assumptions—it was up to
                    the people to decide what was best for their own welfare. He claimed that his constituents wanted

            </p>
            <p>The sole Whig member of the delegation, Edward W. McGaughey, seemed to feel that his presence would
                    not help stop the threatened dissolution of the Union, for he wrote to an old Hoosier

            <p>By early May, the Hoosier Senators had taken their position for compromise. Although senior Senator
                    Bright, a member of the committee of thirteen, did not choose to take the floor to express his views
                    at great length, he did claim that he was "willing to take a great middle conservative
                    course." This was a fairly typical reaction for many members of his party in the state and
                    also for many of the Whigs.</p>

                    freedom, the former must be told that no more slave territory, under any circumstances can be

            <p>Later in the same month, the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> again stated its position. It did not view the
                    compromise effort as a mere party measure: "We wish to say that we are bound to no party,
                    sect, or man. We advocated non-intervention in 1848, because it was right. If right then, it is
                    certainly right now; and we are not inclined to abandon a principle adopted in 1848, particularly
                    when that principle is now fortified by the support of such statesmen as <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> and Webster, in addition to that of the Illustrious Democratic statesmen of the
                    age." Yet it was not ready to adopt the southern position regarding the Proviso. If the
                    constitution were to be changed, "we wish it to be so changed that there will be no doubt
                    of the power of Congress to prevent the spread of a 'great social evil'
                    deplored by all good men. If this be Whiggery, then we are a Whig, and a supporter of a Whig
                        measure."<hi rend="sup">59</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Opposition was expressed, however, by the Free Soil contingent who claimed that Bright and Whitcomb
                    had gone over to the enemy: "The South holds slavery as the <hi rend="i">ne plus ultra</hi>

            <p>A few days later George W. Julian of the Whitewater Valley attacked the southern aggressors who were
                    stretching the compromises of the constitution over a vast area in order to protect slavery.
                    Parties, he declared, in order to maintain their national organizations intact clung to the old
                    issues of the bank and the tariff, but when the question of slavery was made the issue there was but
                    one bond of union that would hold together on the northern and southern sections of each party and
                    that was subserviency on the part of the North to the slave interests.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Back home in the Whitewater district, Julian's constituents were becoming aroused on the
                    subject of the compromise. The <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> County Democrats met and passed resolutions opposing the extension of slavery into
                    territory then free, and favoring admission of <placeName>

            <p>A week later the Free Soil men of "Old <placeName>

                    </placeName> should be free; they went on record as being opposed to the principle of
                    nonintervention and in favor of the Ordinance of 1787.<hi rend="sup">65</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All over the state, political opinions and ideas were being aired which were indicative of the rising
                    tide of public sentiment. For example, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> at a dinner held in honor of Governor John J. Crittenden of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the guest of the evening made a speech which the local press reported thus:
                    "He said the Union was safe as long as Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

            <p>The <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> played an interesting role at this particular time in reporting the
                    reactions in Indiana to the compromise. In the midst of the controversy, the Chapmans, who had so
                    vigorously advanced the cause of the New Democracy in Indiana, sold the paper to William J. Brown
                    and his son Austin. Congressman "Done Brown," a great political friend of Bright,
                    had played both ends against the middle in making promises to southern and northern Democrats alike
                    during the speakership fight in 1849, only to be caught in his political game.<hi rend="sup">65</hi>

                    article without any explanation which you will know how to insert without further
                    instructions." The elder Brown also sent copy to the printer, Nathaniel Bolton, husband of
                    the Hoosier poetess, for insertion. Directed from <placeName>

                    followed the dictates of the Democracy.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> The reshuffling of ownership resulted
                    in a stronger policy. Within a short time the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> declared that:
                    "Now let no democratic free soiler go off in a tangent. With them we intend to have no
                    quarrel, so long as they vote the democratic ticket, support Democratic men and Democratic measures,
                    stand by the old time honored Democratic platform without attempting to tear up the planks and
                    narrow the dimensions, so that a northern sectional party can only stand on it. The Democratic party
                    is a national party, and we shall quarrel with the man who attempts to make it sectional.</p>
            <p>"We are opposed to extending Slavery into any territory now free, and although we may differ
                    with many democrats, good and true upon the mode by which this is to be done—with such we
                    shall reason and not quarrel." Any man who believed in a "higher law" or
                    opposed a fugitive slave act was an abolitionist, not a Democrat. "Take your seats in the
                    Omnibus with the Southern Disunionists," cried the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi>.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>

            <p>The hope for a solution to the compromise problem on a political level continued to be expressed by
                    the politicians and the press. One of the first politicians to speak was Cyrus Dunham, Democratic
                    representative from southeastern Indiana, who early in June claimed that while Congress had the
                    power to limit slavery, it might not be expedient for it to do so; he also claimed that he was as
                    conciliatory as a Hoosier dared to be.<hi rend="sup">68</hi> Nathaniel Albertson, Democratic

                    Taylor's plan but felt it his duty to support any proposition that would bring peace and
                    tranquillity to the nation. As a clincher for his argument, he defended the Fugitive Slave Law at

            <p>During the long summer of 1850, while these politicians and the press were laboring over the more
                    practical aspects of a legal solution to the questions that threatened the federal union, there was
                    a broadening impulse felt by Hoosiers who contemplated the wider implications of the dilemma. It
                    would seem that some Hoosier leaders, political and otherwise, tried to place the situation in a
                    broader context.</p>
            <p>Governor Wright, for example, was always politically conscious, but his speech at the inauguration of
                    the Reverend Lucien Berry as President of Indiana Asbury University was at least novel in approach.
                    He urged the faculty of the University to quell the disconcerting course that sectionalism was
                    taking: "I trust you will inculcate in the minds of the young men who shall come hither for
                    instruction, a burning love for the union of these States. It is too common an Occurrence to see our
                    young men in the North and South on examination days, and at school exhibitions, engaged in
                    rehearsing the beauties of this, or the evils of that section of the country, fostering in the
                    youthful mind a bigoted love for this or that section of the country, at the expense of the other. I
                    have no patience to sit down and hear men talk about this or that section of the Union, or of the
                    peculiar framework of society in this or that State, in opposition to those of other States. This
                    continually speaking of Northern interest, Southern interest, Northern population, and Southern
                    population, is an evil that demands a remedy. This Union is not composed of a few cities in the
                    North and South; the people of this Union consist of something else than iron mills and wooden
                    clocks in the North or of rice and cotton bales in the South. We of the West have something to say
                    as to who and what compose this union…. The time has now arrived when the influence of
                    the West, in her conservative spirit, should be felt in the settlement of all our national
                    questions…. Differing as we do in soil, climate, and productions—in habits,
                    manners, and social relations—in local and sectional interest—we can only be
                    one people upon the principles of concession and conciliation…. May you renounce all
                    sectional parties—sternly rebuke any and every effort to form a northern
                        party!"<hi rend="sup">75</hi> After diagnoaing the ills of the union in a broad

                    look upon the slavery question now at issue between the North and the South as a mere temporary
                    struggle for political quality or political ascendancy, and Abolition as a hobbyhorse, on which to

                    notice: "Politics engross but little of my attention. To me this spectacle has often been a
                    melancholy one to see communities agitated almost to moral insanity by party spirit, when perhaps
                    the questions at issue were not calculated, in the event of their being carried either way to
                    materially affect the interests of a single individual. At the present day I see, or think I see a
                    strange spirit of infatuation dementing thousands in both North and South. I conceive the cause of
                    the whole commotion to be puritanical cant in the north and gross ignorance in the south. The silly
                    cry of 'Northern Aggression' is, as you have clearly shown, so unfounded and
                    foolish that none but a man totally ignorant of p&amp; history, would be fool enough to believe
                    that ever the north has encroached in the least on southern rights. Many of the southern members

                    out of the agitation aroused further comment: "Within the last five years, and more

                    people—the whole body politic has been convulsed by the conflict of opinions, the
                    declaration and denial of rights. Men have acted as if mad, or laboring under the influence of some
                    strange delusion. Especially has this been the case with many persons living in the southern
                    portions of our Union, where the climate predisposes man to the enjoyment of leisure and the

            <p>These examples of the prevailing state of restlessness during the summer of 1850 indicated the
                    Hoosier politicians' need for a broader understanding of the growing disturbance. The
                    questions that were being raised in some men's minds were charged with what historians a
                    hundred years later would label "hyper-emotionalism." It is interesting to observe
                    that after the irritant which the politicians provided had induced the rash of disquieting opinions,
                    they were prepared to offer another application of the same remedy—by playing more
                    politics they hoped to allay the uncomfortableness felt by these observers who were afraid of the

                    fugitive slave provisions, a fact which the Senator was called upon to explain in the ensuing
                    canvass. The voting revealed that it was the Fugitive Slave Law that proved the real stumbling block
                    for Indiana's congressmen.</p>
            <p>To a great degree, the popular press reaction to the compromise in the state followed the pattern
                    established by its representatives in Congress. The popular opposition to the entire compromise held
                    a minority position. The greatest protest that arose over the political settlement of the slavery
                    issue came from those who could not condone the Fugitive Slave Law. In this reaction, the Hoosiers
                    were not alone—they were merely voicing the general feeling of many in the Northwest. In
                    order to express their dissatisfaction more vociferously, meetings were held throughout the state
                    during which, for the moment at least, Whigs and Democrats saw eye to eye on the repugnant features
                    of the Fugitive Slave Law. At one such meeting in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greencastle</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as reported by the <hi rend="i">Indiana State Sentinel</hi>, it was resolved:
                    "That it was with pain we witnessed the fearful agitations through which we have just
                    passed. For ten months the national legislature was almost suspended, the wheels of government
                    became nearly motionless. … In these agitations we have taken part with neither the
                    abolitionists of the north or the disunionists of the south, but steadily regarding the perpetuation
                    of our unparalleled system of government … and as patriots we hail with just pride and
                    rejoicing the system of compromise measures passed at the last session of congress….
                    Further the resolutions declared that the meeting would not countenance abduction of slaves from
                    slave states and would not permit 'negro stealing any sooner than horse
                        stealing.'"<hi rend="sup">79</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such sentiments as these sounded political warnings for the Indiana congressmen who had approved the
                    compromise measures. Some of them were quick to break into print explaining their legislative
                    actions.</p>
            <p>William J. Brown made a strong plea in favor of the "peace bill," as he termed it.
                    He condoned the Fugitive Slave Law as a practical measure with which to prove that the people of the
                    North were willing "to sacrifice all upon the altar of constitutional
                        obligation."<hi rend="sup">80</hi>

                    explaining: "I have no more sympathy with the institution of slavery than any other man,
                    but while we exist under the same Constitution with slave States, I am decidedly in favor of
                    discharging our constitutional obligations towards them, however much I detest the institution which
                    they have made the basis of their socisl <hi rend="i">[sic]</hi> system."<hi rend="sup">81</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of the editors of the Hoosier press also lent their support to the compromise. They too sought
                    to explain the fugitive slave provisions, trying to make them more acceptable. A <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> editor declared that: "Something must be conceded to the necessities of the
                    times. It was thought by many better to have peace and save the union. It is possible that some of
                    the provisions of the fugitive slave law may seem very stringent. But something had to be yielded,
                    as well as something sustained."<hi rend="sup">82</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Equally conciliatory was the <hi rend="i">Indiana State Journal</hi>, central organ of the Whig
                    party. While it did not take a positive position as to the merits of the Fugitive Slave Law, it made
                    a plea for a fair trial without continued agitation against it: "that the law should be
                    given a fair trial,—and if it only secures the object of the Constitution, without unjust
                    requirements at the hands of the people of the free States, then let it remain as it
                        is."<hi rend="sup">83</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is safe to say that these opinions were typical of the majority of the press. While it could speak
                    in a positive tone about the compromise generally, it had to make reservations concerning the
                    troublesome Fugitive Slave Law.</p>
            <p>Protests were also heard in every part of the state, but these initial outbursts were tempered or
                    withdrawn, after giving the problem sober second thought. The course of the <placeName>

                    license to kidnappers," this newspaper gradually spoke with a calmer voice; within a short
                    time it was merely challenging the constitutionality of the law.<hi rend="sup">84</hi>

            <p>The vital opposition minority which continued agitating against the law was composed of members of
                    both parties, for the party lines were being broken by those who opposed as well as by those who
                    approved the compromise. Whether the appeals to rise above party loyalty and join hands were made by
                    the proponents or opponents of any issue, they spelled danger to party structure.</p>
            <p>One of the immediate results of the controversial Fugitive Slave Law was the hierarchical quarrel
                    that developed between Bright and the editor of the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi>, Michael C. Garber.
                    The Indiana senator had assumed that the newspaper was his personal mouthpiece; consequently, when
                    Garber denounced the law in the columns of the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> in October, Bright rose up
                    indignantly and proceeded to read Garber out of the Democratic party. In addition to his attack on
                    the Fugitive Slave Law, the editor had reported favorably the action of Governor Wright in state
                    affairs. Both acts were cardinal sins in the eyes of Bright, and he retaliated by creating a new
                    political organ for <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Yet the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> was not occupying an extreme position, as witnessed by its
                    treatment a few days later of the Presbyterian church assemblies for their attacks on the Fugitive
                    Slave Law and for preaching the doctrine of a "higher law." Garber wrote:
                    "We have expressed our view of the fugitive law. We don't like it, and we will
                    use our little influence to get it modified, or repealed. But we cannot sanction even by silence,
                    the treasonable language of the assemblies … no matter how thickly the 'cloud
                    of facts' in connection with the subject of 'fugitives' from
                    religious oppression may thicken around us." And again: "the law must be so
                    modified and framed that <hi rend="i">white</hi> people may not be liable to seizure and
                    extradition, upon proof made in another state."<hi rend="sup">86</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The confusion over the Fugitive Slave Law also affected the successful alliances that had been
                    patched together in 1849. Julian, a thorough-going Free Soil radical, owed his seat in Congress to
                    such an alliance. Although the Democrats of the Whitewater Valley did not love the Negro, they had
                    been perfectly willing to support Julian, if by so doing they could overthrow the firmly entrenched
                    Whig organization led by Caleb B. Smith. The existence of this particular coalition was endangered
                    by the reactions to the law.</p>

            <p>Julian realized his political life was in danger, for he wrote to his wife: "There is danger
                    d so many and such serious divisions among the Whigs as to encourage the Democrats to set up a man
                    of their own. It <hi rend="i">may</hi> be that the Hunkers of both the old parties will unite
                    against me in favor of some Fugitive Slave Law man, in which event the honest men of all parties
                    will rally to me against that law."<hi rend="sup">87</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not all of the reactions to the Fugitive Slave Law were in a negative direction. On the positive side
                    there was the minor, though important, fact that the schedule of the underground railroad was
                    speeded up.<hi rend="sup">88</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is difficult to evaluate the role played by the church assemblies in the controversy. Some of them
                    took a vehement stand against the Fugitive Slave Law; others refused to take any stand, saying this
                    matter was outside the province of the church. Both reactions, in the end, resulted in keeping the
                    question constantly in the minds of the people, irritating many but influencing few to change their
                    minds on the matter, although occasionally an individual who felt he was being pushed into making a
                    decision, either for or against the law, reacted by withdrawing from the scene. The effects of the
                    efforts of the church assemblies to resolve the problem were neither negative nor positive.</p>
            <p>Those individuals and groups who favored the compromise appealed to patriotism, good faith,
                    constitutionalism, and observance of law. When the Fugitive Slave Law was being tested in the
                    courts, Elisha <placeName>

                    determined that sectional agitation should cease. He declared: "Whatever may be the
                    feelings of the great body of the people in regard to the institution of domestic slavery, they will
                    never be found making war on the rights of others. In the midst of a sectional controversy which has
                    shaken the government to its centre, it has been our boast that Indiana has been faithful to the
                    constitution—her tribunals of justice have ever been unawed and uninfluenced, and it is
                    my firm belief that she will be found faithful to the last.</p>

            <p>"Gentlemen, there are too may <hi rend="i">[sic]</hi> indications of a coming storm, and
                    although the spec [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] in the horizon may now be no larger than a
                    man's hand, it portends a crisis in public affairs which will test the stability of our
                    public institutions. Threatened resistance to the law of Congress and inflammatory appeals to the
                    misguided passions of a portion of the people of the North have placed weapons in the hands of those
                    in the South who seek to overturn the government. Where this is to end God only knows; but our path
                    of duty is plain. We must stand by the rights of others as we stand by our own. —We must
                    observe the laws and we must enforce our observance where they are resisted—we must keep
                    our faith not only with each other, but with the citizens of other States."<hi rend="sup">89</hi> The Judge spoke for a group of influential and highly respected citizens of the state
                    representing both parties. Some of these men were past their political prime and had become leaders
                    in business and banking; among them were Oliver H. Smith, Charles Test, James Raridan, and Charles
                    Dewey.</p>
            <p>Many similar statements were heard in Indiana during the winter of 1850–1851, but the
                    Judge had struck squarely upon the troublesome dilemma: Slavery was an institution to the Hoosier
                    about which he had "feelings"; those who were materially interested in the
                    institution had "rights." Typical of those who supported the compromise, the Judge
                    was not willing to allow "feeling" to enter the courtroom.</p>
            <p>It had proved impossible, however, to keep "feeling" out of the state
                    constitutional convention. Indiana's delegates had met on October 4, 1850, to begin their
                    long sessions in revising the fundamental laws of the state. Although the Compromise of 1850 was of
                    no immediate concern to this convention, James Raridan, a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> County Whig, suggested that resolutions favoring the compromise be passed, and thus
                    touched off a heated debate. Some of the members of the body refused to become involved, claiming
                    that they had not had time to gauge the opinions of those they represented, but from November 30 to
                    December 4, the convention argued over the resolutions. John U. Pettit of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> cried out that Raridan's action was an "allopathic dose of
                    political medicine," and although he personally favored the Compromise, Pettit claimed the
                    resolutions were politically inspired and therefore had no business on the floor of the convention.
                    Raridan answered that the resolutions <list type="footnotes">

                    anti-Union party.<hi rend="sup">90</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The debates revolved about several issues: Was it within the province of the convention to discuss
                    the resolutions? Were they political or not? Was the union in danger? Was the Compromise of 1850
                    really what it claimed to be—a compromise? By placing the issue on the basis of Union <hi rend="i">vs</hi>. anti-Union, it behooved the delegates to express their views carefully, lest
                    they be misinterpreted, and lead to accusations of disunionist sentiment. Consequently, those who
                    opposed the resolutions (and by implication, a portion of the compromise, frequently the Fugitive
                    Slave Law) chose to attack the convention's right to pass any such measures when the
                    purpose of their meeting was to form a new state constitution. Raridan's strategy was
                    difficult to circumvent—he had attempted to make a Union meeting of the constitutional
                    convention.</p>
            <p>The resolutions finally passed the convention by a vote of 90 to 25. The minority represented
                    primarily the southeastern counties of the state: the Whitewater Valley. Although there were five
                    abstainees in the balloting, it might safely be assumed that the majority favored the provisions. It
                    was a plebiscite in a sense, testing the slogan that "Indiana knows no North, that she
                    knows no South, that she knows nothing but the Union."</p>
            <p>On the last day of the eventful year of 1850, the governor of the state, Joseph A. Wright, in his
                    message to the legislature, made one final plea to the citizens of Indiana when he declared:
                    "Complete unanimity is rarely the incident of human councils. In a confederacy like ours,
                    differing as its members do, in soil, climate, and productions; in habits, manners and social
                    relations; in local and sectional interests, it could not be expected now, any more than at the
                    birth of our Federal Constitution, that any compromise, based upon mutual concessions, should be
                    satisfactory to all.</p>
            <p>"It is not a practical question whether those measures of peace, recently framed by great
                    and good men, in the same spirit which actuated our fathers in days gone by, are, in every respect,
                    such as meet our unqualified approval. It has been well said, that the lives of the best of us are
                    spent in choosing between evils; and it is often a bounden duty to endure a temporary and incidental
                    evil for a permanent and inherent good….</p>

            <p>Since 1848, the Hoosiers had endured two years of political strife that had stemmed out of the
                    territorial questions of the rapidly expanding nation. The end of the year 1850 found many people
                    accepting the Compromise, people like the Governor who felt it their duty to tolerate a temporary
                    and incidental evil for a permanent and inherent good. To them Slavery, as a legal question, had
                    been settled by a series of statutes. Indiana's politicians, still in the middle of the
                    conflict, to be sure, preferred to consider themselves out of it, picturing themselves as a great
                    force representing the Union, and scorning those of the North and South who had given way to
                    "misguided passions."</p>
            <p>Although the majority of the Indiana politicians played their role to the hilt as representatives of
                    a "central state" maintaining a "high, conservative position,"
                    they knew that, after all, they were on the same stage as the other players. If the Union stage
                    collapsed, all the members of the cast would tumble together.</p>

                    the tax rates were: "Conner $15.00, Fitch $15.00, Newman $5.00, Oatman $5.00, Jones $5.00,

                    place. After a few years of prompting, work was finally begun, and a macadamized toll road,
                    considered adequate for the contemporary needs, was completed. Fording was the customary procedure
                    in crossing small streams, but in 1828 money was appropriated to build a stone-arch bridge on this
                    road over Falling Run Creek at the lower edge of town. For many years this engineering achievement

                    applications, and finally did succeed in obtaining the privileges he desired; but he had to be

            <p>The question which first confronted the infant towns on both banks of the river was whether a canal
                    would benefit or hinder their individual progress. There were considerations to be weighed on both

            <p>By the second decade of the nineteenth century it was obvious that some kind of canal would be built,
                    and to hold the first view was no longer in keeping with reality. Cities above the Falls, most
                    notably <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, were determined that they would no longer suffer the inconvenience to their shipping
                    and to their pocketbooks. The only time the Falls, "whose terrors have paralized the arm of
                        enterprize,"<hi rend="sup">20</hi> could be gotten over with any degree of safety was
                    during the brief semiannual periods of high water. The wrecks strewn in the area were fair warning
                    to those who had the idea of "shooting" the rapids when the river was at its
                    normal stage. Surveys of the area had been made as early as 1793,<hi rend="sup">21</hi> and
                    corporations for building the canal had been formed in the legislatures of both Indiana Territory
                    and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> as far back as 1804 and 1805.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Henry Clay had laid the matter
                    before Congress in 1807, and Albert Gallatin had made recommendations to the federal government in

                    </placeName> and Indiana interests combined to make the building inevitable.</p>
            <p>When it became clear that the canal would be built, the important question came to be on which side
                    of the river would the artificial channel run. If on the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, already having a head start on the Indiana towns, would draw whatever additional
                    benefits accrued from the building. This would guarantee its future superiority over <placeName>

                    </placeName> and New <placeName>

                    closely to the Indiana shore and give the Indiana towns the advantage. Indiana's Benjamin
                    Hovey had written a pamphlet back in 1805 which had done much to establish the belief that the canal
                    would best be dug on the Indiana side. Henry M'Murtrie ridiculed this attempt <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Upon this scene of conflict and confusion there appeared in 1842 a man whose ideas and teachings in
                    the field of medicine and philosophy were strange and provocative of suspicion even in that period.
                    His contribution to the confusion was to combine elements of phrenology, mesmerism, homeopathy, and
                    eclecticism, and a host of his own ideas, and emerge with a system of moral philosophy and medical
                    science which anticipated parts of modern psychology, psychiatry, and spiritualism, and which
                    contained many points now conceded by medical scientists. The man was Joseph Rodes Buchanan, son of

                    old, there are numerous indications that the influence of the father was a major factor in shaping
                    the later life of his son. For that reason it seems advisable to give a brief resume of the life and

                    this period were published, in 1812, as <hi rend="i">The Philosophy of Human Nature</hi>. This was
                    his most important work and was "one of the earliest systematic and consistent
                    presentations of materialism to be published in America." Based mainly on the writings of
                    Charles Darwin, David Hue, and David Hartley —whose teachings Buchanan first encountered
                    while working with Dr. Samuel Brown —the book falls in two general divisions. The first
                    chapter was devoted to refuting the idea that the mind existed as an independent entity, and in the
                    remaining chapters he presented experimental evidence to describe the operations and laws of human
                    nature. Although he ultimately accepted the agnostic position, Buchanan attempted "to show
                    that a materialistic explanation of mind is more in accord with reason and fact than a spiritual
                    explanation." This emphasis on matter rather than on mind, plus his attempt to construct a
                    materialistic monism, has caused some to refer to Buchanan as "the earliest native
                    physiological psychologist."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Joseph Buchanan refused to believe that there was in man a spiritual mind "possessed of an
                    original activity, able to feed and think within itself or to commence thought, sentiment, and
                    motion." He accepted the theory that "matter alone is capable of displaying all
                    the phenomena of animal life" and concluded that "the human system is thus a
                    machine entirely material, composed of a great variety of elementary particles." To
                    Buchanan the mind was simply an organic state of matter, "a peculiar combination of
                    material elements, capable of displaying the attributes of intellect," and in no manner
                    dependent upon any immaterial or spiritual element.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These arguments were in direct opposition to the later teachings of his son, who placed much stress
                    upon the importance of spiritual influence. But father and son were in agreement that "the
                    brain or sensory organ is the seat of intellectual life and is intimately related and dependent upon
                    the whole vital system."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

                    and his environment. As early as 1812 he had formulated the theory, which was to be the fundamental
                    basis of the teachings of his son in later years, that "physical agents cannot possibly
                    co-exist … without exerting their energies on each other." Thus, every substance
                    on earth, vital or inanimate was affected by atmospheric elements, water, caloric, electricity, and
                    all the rest. "The human body … becomes therefore dependent on them alike for
                    its preservation and destruction, its life and death."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In reference to phrenology the elder Buchanan expressed doubt as to its validity, but at the same
                    time used its theories as an argument for materialism. "According to the observations of
                    many ingenious men, the external form and internal texture of the brain, are very important
                    circumstances to the intellect it embraces. If that intellect were purely spiritual and
                    intrinsically active, it is very improbable that these trivial circumstances in the mere instrument
                    of its operations could make an important difference in its powers: but if mentality be only an
                    attribute of the living brain, it is then to be expected, that a different proportion of parts in
                    that organ, or a slight variation in its intrinsic structure, would produce the greatest difference
                    of intellectual powers which occurs among men. The fact then, as stated above; that the various
                    degrees of intelligent power observable among men, and other animals also, may be traced to
                    varieties in the formation and texture of their nervous systems; is no inconsiderable argument for
                    M&amp; terialism."<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Joseph Buchanan also denied the doctrine of a nervous fluid "or subtle matter secreted in
                    the brain, and diffused through the whole system of the body" as one which merely
                    complicated the situation. Granted there were such a fluid, what, he asked, was there to stimulate
                        it?<hi rend="sup">13</hi> He thought it much safer and simpler to accept what was to him the
                    obvious explanation—that the nervous system was an entirely material one, stimulated by
                    material things and acting upon material objects.</p>
            <p>These ideas—all embraced in Buchanan's major work—coming from the

                    between religious "liberalism" and infidelity. The campaign against anything
                    smacking of vice or heresy was instigated and conducted mainly by John Campbell and the
                    Presbyterians. It reached into all walks of life and was ever in search of objects to attack.</p>
            <p>In the eyes of the religionists <hi rend="i">The Philosophy of Human Nature</hi> was an outstanding
                    example of infidelity. They could not swallow Buchanan's materialism nor his denial of
                    the influence of the spiritual element in life. The fact that Buchanan also insisted on complete
                    separation of church and state merely added to the ire of the Presbyterians—who
                    maintained that a true republican government, to be successful, must be in the hands of Christian
                    citizens and Christian leaders—and he became the center of attack.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The hardy philosopher rallied to the occasion, however, and under the pseudonyms
                    "Civis," "A Native Kentuckian," and others, became the
                    editorialist who "most ably and insistently presented" the views of the liberals.
                    Thereafter he continued to play a leading role in the controversy and his agitations were a major
                    factor in eventually wresting from the Presbyterians their control of Transylvania University.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Buchanan's personal views in regard to religion as such seem to be an open question. Both
                    his political and his religious enemies accused him of atheism, but he has left no definite
                    assertion that such was his status. "On the contrary, his references to God were
                    reverential, and he often spoke of himself as a Christian."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was in their ideas on education that Joseph Buchanan and his son were most nearly alike. After
                    resigning from the Transylvania faculty in 1810, Joseph Buchanan went East to study the Pestalozzian
                    system of education, and soon thereafter he returned to <placeName>

                    material which they could easily master and advance from there to successively harder material;
                    nothing should be passed until mastered. "He wished to cultivate the memory and powers of
                    recollection, on the principles of analogy and association." Following the rule that the
                    powers and habits of human beings were most effectively strengthened and confirmed by vigorous and
                    systematic exercise, he employed the methods of observation and experimentation, and rewarded the

            </p>
            <p>The suspicious Presbyterians frowned upon this system of education. They branded Buchanan as
                    "a professed Infidel… [who] was about to establish a school on Neif's
                        [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] system, where youth are to stay from eight to twenty-one years, and thus
                    be initiated into all the illusions of infidelity from their earliest infancy."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> As a result of these attacks by religious parties, the school failed after
                    two years, but Joseph Buchanan's "sanguine predictions" as to his new
                    method of education "were fully realized, in the education of his own son."<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having met with opposition and defeat in the field of education, Buchanan next turned his attention

            <p>In 1816 the Buchanan-Johnson partnership was dissolved, probably because of bankruptcy, and Buchanan
                    became editor of the <hi rend="i">Light House</hi> at Harrodsburg. The outcome of this venture is
                    not known, but it must have been similar to the previous one, for in 1819 the Buchanan family was in <placeName>

            <p>The versatile Buchanan now turned his attention to inventive science, and, though he succeeded in
                    making no lasting contributions to the mechanical age, created some interest and excitement among
                    the local citizens. As early as 1805 he had invented an instrument which produced music from glasses
                    of different chemical composition, but the gadget was never put into operation. In 1821 he
                    constructed a spiral boiler which embraced improvements in the way of lightness, economy, and
                    safety. The generation of steam in small tubes, incapable of explosion, was the fundamental idea of
                    this boiler, and it: was Buchanan's hope that the principle might be successfully applied
                    to aerial navigation. In 1824–1825 he applied his engine to a wagon with sufficient

            <p>Those who have studied the life and works of Joseph Buchanan speak of him only in the most glowing
                    terms. One who was intimately acquainted with him remembered his "slender form, massive

                    attained the highest rank in any pursuit upon which his energies had been concentrated; but
                    cultivating his intellect to the neglect of other powers, he scorned the pursuit of wealth;
                    abstracted himself from society, lived in continual pecuniary embarrassment… wasted his
                    powers in desultory labors, lived and died comparatively indifferent to fame."<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

            <p>Joseph Buchanan was an outstanding example of versatility in an age of versatile men. He was a
                    doctor, editor, philosopher, educator, lawyer, scientist, and historian; and at various times he
                    made important contributions to each field. He was "essentially an intellectual pioneer
                    working in an environment which encouraged versatility rather than specialization and profundity,
                    [and] he contributed substantially to the development of culture in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> River Valley." It was only his inability to concentrate his efforts on a
                    single task that saved him from fame. "His significance consists in having most thoroughly
                    thought out a philosophy to supplant the recognized forms of dogmatic theology, and of having then
                    proceeded to live by that philosophy. In his major work Buchanan not only attacked many fundamental
                    theological concepts, but provided a theory of human nature and of morality, which he felt to be a
                    satisfactory basis upon which to build human character."<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>Such was the diversified nature of the father of Joseph Rodes Buchanan. That the son of such a man
                    would face both problems and opportunities unique in a pioneer setting goes without question. When
                    young Buchanan was born, his father's most important works had already been accomplished;
                    he was known as a doctor, teacher, author, and editor, and aa an advocate of
                    "liberalism" he had been a leader of the ultimate victors in one of the
                    West's most violent controversies. Through his revolutionary ideas on education and
                    philosophy he had won both loyal supporters and bitter enemies. Controversy followed him to the
                    grave, and he left behind him a son capable of continuing the struggle.</p>
            <p>Of the early life of Joseph Rodes Buchanan very little has been recorded. The family moved about too
                    much for him to have established strong ties in any one place; from <placeName>

            <p>Books and education seem to have occupied a major portion of young Buchanan's early years,
                    and of that phase we have more information, with the influence and guidance of his father being
                    everywhere evident. Even in childhood he was "noted for his uncommon maturity of

                    reading the work of Robert Dale Owen on that subject. And from Buchanan's own pen there
                    is the testimony that during his youth he had access to "daily packages of

            <p>Joseph Buchanan's ambition was to make a lawyer of his son and when the boy was only
                    thirteen personally conducted him through the study of Blackstone's <hi rend="i">Commentaries</hi>. Having studied law in 1847, and having later lectured to a private law
                    class, Buchanan was, by pioneer standards, a well-qualified teacher of jurisprudence.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> But young Buchanan had been too long and too closely associated with the all absorbing
                    editorial activities of his father, and his first love was for the printer's ink and the
                    clatter of the press.</p>
            <p>For five years following the death of his father, Buchanan sustained himself by labor as a printer
                    and teacher, at the same time vigorously continuing his studies. But in 1834, poor health having
                    forced him to give up this work, he turned his attention to another of his father's
                    former pursuits and took up the study of medicine at Transylvania.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                    so vociferously attacked in later years. He later described Cooke as "an honest and earnest

            <p>At that time the medical department at Transylvania was the best and most prosperous one west of the

                    been a success from the beginning. In 1839 its new building, consisting of three lecture rooms, four
                    dissecting rooms, apartments for the faculty, and various other facilities, was completed. By the
                    end of 1838 its library contained approximately twelve hundred volumes, and the following summer Dr.
                    J. B. Flint was sent to Europe to purchase more.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>The requirements for graduation were typical of similar institutions of the period. The only entrance
                    requirements were the ability to read and write, while fees were relatively small—five
                    dollars for matriculation, fifteen dollars for each course of lectures, and ten dollars for an
                    optional dissecting ticket.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Two years of apprenticeship and two sessions of
                    lectures of four months each comprised the practical experience and formal classroom requirements.
                    The student, who had to be twenty years old and of good character, was then subjected to both public
                    and private oral examinations, which were conducted by the faculty and two practicing physicians.
                    Finally, the candidate was required to present a thesis in English, French, or Latin, on some

            <p>It is impossible to say just when Buchanan first became interested in phrenology. He undoubtedly had
                    heard of it through his father, and perhaps through his own reading, which was extensive; and any
                    interest which he may have displayed relative to the subject probably was further stimulated at
                    Transylvania by <placeName>

                    </placeName>. At any rate, by 1835, Buchanan had devoted enough attention to the subject to have
                    gained some recognition; and during that year he traveled to Natchez, <placeName>

                    </placeName>—and perhaps other places in the South—where he "engaged
                    in the study and diffusion of phrenological science." The following year, having become
                    convinced of "the substantial truth of the Gallian system of Phrenology," he
                    devoted himself "exclusively to the phrenological study of man."<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for his reasons for taking up phrenology, there is Buchanan's own testimony:
                    "My life has been devoted to the study of man, his destiny and his happiness. Uncontrolled
                    in education, I learned to brook no mental restraint, and thrown upon my own resources in boyhood,
                    difficulties but strengthened the passion for philosophical knowledge.</p>
            <p>"Anthropology had no systematic development, and its elementary sciences were in confusion.
                    Mental philosophy was too limited in its scope, and had too little of the practical character. In
                    studying medicine it seemed that I had wandered through a wilderness without compass or cardinal
                    points. Phrenology promised much and I examined it cautionsly [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>.] It struck me
                    as an unsatisfactory system of mental philosophy, but one worthy of investigation as a natural

            <p>"My interest increased with extent of my observations until I abandoned practical medicine

            </p>
            <p>But he was not satisfied merely to correct and expand the Gallian system of phrenology.
                    Fundamentally, Buchanan was a philosopher seeking answers to all the questions which had troubled
                    man from the dawn of time. He was searching for a "science of man," in the
                    broadest sense of the phrase—a science which would include not only the study of
                    man's mind but one which would comprehend the relationship between mind and body, between
                    man and his fellow man, and between man and his environment—a science which would define
                    and explain the connection between man and the universe, between man and God.</p>
            <p>According to Buchanan, up to that date there had been no true science of man, only four or five
                    partial ones. Metaphysics was one such partial science; phrenology was another, and the two differed
                    in that the latter looked "at human nature as it is, instead of looking for a theoretical
                    substratum." Metaphysics had proved itself inadequate, and phrenology had failed to devise
                    a true system of mental science because its discoveries were based only on an inadequate
                    cranioscopy, incompetent of revealing the true nature of the brain. Physiology and anatomy also had
                    failed because they revealed nothing of the power of the brain and therefore could not be
                    philosophical. Natural history, social history, and animal magnetism had brought to light many
                    wonderful facts, but without giving any satisfactory explanation for the nature of man.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Buchanan adopted phrenology merely as a stepping stone toward something infinitely more
                    ambitious—a science which, if perfected would end all the age-old controversies relative
                    to the cause, purpose, and ultimate fate of man. He was groping for something akin to what modern
                    science calls <list type="footnotes">

                    scheme went much further than either of these have dared to go.</p>
            <p>Such a science Buchanan first called anthropology. But this term he deemed inadequate; it implied
                    only a science of man, whereas his science was to include not only man but every living thing. A
                    more inclusive term was necessary. He decided on "neurology," which he defined as
                    the science of nervous matter—including man and all the animal kingdom.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Buchanan's main criticism of the Gallian system was that it was neither complete nor
                    symmetrical. "To the philosopher … it suggests the idea of an incomplete system
                    arrested in the midst of its progress." It seemed "deficient in analysis, and
                    overladen with arbitrary incongruous details." And it failed the test of practicality, a
                    basic claim of phrenology, because it gave no organ of the brain for many of the actions of man. He
                    thought that the phrenological system must refer "every decided or distinct tendency of
                    human nature … to a definite cerebral source," and that for each tendency there
                    must be an opposite tendency—and an organ for it. Upon these arguments he based his
                    conclusion that the Gallian system had two fundamental shortcomings: It was one-sided and
                    unbalanced, and, in consequence of its incompleteness, it was inconsistent with itself.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Buchanan regarded the phrenological system as a protest against the old metaphysicists, and declared
                    "either we must go back to the old Metaphysical ground, and deny that our passions and
                    faculties are connected with a definite portion of the brain …; or we must adopt the
                    Phrenological doctrine <hi rend="i">fully and unequivocally</hi> and carry it out to its legitimate
                    results. This is what the Gallian system has failed to do."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> All these
                    deficiencies Buchanan set out to correct; and with this work he evidently occupied most of his time
                    as a student at the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Medical Institute.</p>
            <p>The earlier phrenologists had relied upon three methods of investigation—vivisection,
                    pathology, and cranioscopy. Buchanan rejected all three. Vivisection—operating on living
                    animals—he dismissed as equally cruel and fruitless; pathology was out because there was
                    an insufficient knowledge of <list type="footnotes">

                    though he considered cranioscopy the most simple and most successful method used up to that time,
                    even it could not perfect "nor positively demonstrate the science [of
                    phrenology]." Its drawback was that irregular thickness of the skull sometimes led to wrong
                    conclusions. In general, Buchanan wrote, the outline of the cranium indicated the true outline of
                    character; but over activity or under activity of any portion of the brain might cause variations
                    and the character will depart from the outline of the cranium. "Whenever the organs become
                    inactive through lack of exercise, they shrink in size, the bone thickens by growing inward, and the
                    skull becomes opaque." For these reasons bumps usually did not indicate brain development,
                    which, therefore, must be inferred from the general contour of the cranium.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to avoid these difficulties Buchanan early de doped a new method of investigation, which he
                    called the "sensitive mode." In using this method he watched the sensations which
                    various mental activities had on his head. He noted that a scholarly lecture gave him a
                    "marked sensation" in the upper portion of his forehead and concluded that this
                    was the region of greatest intelligence. In the same manner he located the organs of irritability,
                    anxiety, and many others. He also used the "intuitive method," which relied upon
                    the powers of clairvoyance to determine mental functions and localities by direct perception, and
                    believed that "a clairvoyant of a well disciplined philosophical mind, free from the errors
                    of imagination, is the true telescope and microscope of Phrenological science."<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Relying on these modes of investigation, Buchanan discovered many errors in the Gallian system. For
                    example, he found cowardly men who had large bumps where Gall and Spunheim had located
                    combativeness, and proved, to his own satisfaction, that "the height of the head above the
                    earn did not prove a correct criterian of moral character."<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By 1839 he had, by his own admission, "acquired possession of numerous, sound and
                    comprehensive principles," from which he soon formed a system of philosophy; and he had
                    discovered certain mathematical laws to be the basis of anthropology. <list type="footnotes">

            <p>This system Buchanan regarded as being near the true anthropology, but at the same time he realized
                    that by the methods he was pursuing "a lifetime would scarcely be sufficient to re-organize
                    the science," and he determined "to find some shorter road to the arcana of
                    Cerebral Physiology."<hi rend="sup">46</hi> It occurred to him that if some external agent
                    could be found which would stimulate the different portions of the brain "80 as to
                    manifest, on the instant, and in a striking manner, their peculiar functions," then both
                    the speed and accuracy of his experiments would be greatly improved.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
                    Experimenting first with magnetism and then with galvanism he dismissed both as impractical for his
                    purpose. He then tried a more ambitious plan, "believing that the nervous fluid, or
                    nervaura, was closely analogous to galvanism, and was continually radiated by the human
                    constitution, I applied this influence by touch to the head of a highly impressible and cultivated
                    lady … with the successful result of exciting every point that I touched." It
                    was while lecturing in <placeName>

                    satisfied that he had found the key to the true anthropology.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Buchanan's explanation for this phenomenon was that in the nervous system of every living
                    thing there was a nervaurk fluid or impulse, "which is radiated and conducted freely from
                    the human hand."<hi rend="sup">49</hi> This nervaura, flowing from the fingers of the
                    operator, in turn would be strong enough to stimulate the organs of another person with which the
                    fingers of the operator made contact, provided the organs of the subject were sufficiently
                    sensitive, or "impressible," to react to the stimulus. From this explanation he
                    adopted the term "impressibility" to describe the capacity of an individual to
                    respond to the nervauric impulses flowing from another person.</p>

            <p>The discoverer of this amazing power believed that it was comparable to "the discovery of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>," and that it had been overlooked through the ages only because of its
                    "very simplicity." The revelation of the powers of impressibility changed
                    neurology "from a mere anatomical description of nervous cords and masses, to a
                    comprehensive science embracing all the functions of mind and body."<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
                    He doubted not that it opened up a whole new world for exploration and later wrote that had men been
                    open-minded enough to accept it the year 1841 would have been "the most significant epoch
                    in history—the year in which mankind added psychic to physical science."<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was he slow to put this new power to use. By 1842 he was almost overcome by the results of his
                    experiments, and marveled that results of such magnitude had been so speedily and so correctly
                    attained by one "whom neither years nor official honors have placed in [an] authoritative a
                    position." Triumphantly announcing that within a single month he had been able to learn
                    more of the brain's physiology than previously had been acquired by all the physiologists
                    and pathologists who had worked on the subject, he boasted that: "It is in my power to
                    excite, in a few moments, any portion of the brain, either large or small; to put that portion into
                    full and vigorous action as an efficient portion of the character of the person upon whom I operate,
                    and then, at will, suspend its action, and excite the action of its antagonist organ, or of any
                    other, or group of organs that I choose to bring into play.</p>
            <p>"Thus I make my subjects alternately laugh and weep, reason profoundly of moral truths, and
                    then, without any reason, draw the fist to strike; express the deepest humility, or self-sufficiency
                    and levity; sit for hours with the greatest patience, or leap up with passionate restlessness;
                    express the finest moral sentiments, or assume the manners and feelings of the miser and thief;
                    indulge in eating, and drink strong liquor, or assume a moral dignity, despise sensuality and speak
                    of food with loathing; feel the most exalted moral and religious sentiments, or indulge in levity

            <p>Buchanan's dream had been realized; he had found the key to the secrets of mind and body.
                    With access to these secrets he devoted himself to the task of evolving and organizing a system of
                    moral philosophy and pseudo-medical science which caused an even more violent reaction among medical

                    distinction of editing Indiana's first daily newspaper. Gray sold the paper to Rolla
                    Doolittle and A. C. Grady in November, 1839. Doolittle was apparently the active partner. Four years
                    later the paper changed ownership again; this time it was S. F. Covington who "took

                    fact that neither of the major parties had yet taken a clear stand on the slavery question. He
                    recognized that both parties had their proslavery and antislavery factions. The result of the
                    national election of 1848 made that clear when Zachary Taylor was victorious in seven free states
                    and eight slave.</p>
            <p>By 1852, Garber was bemoaning the low ebb of political strife. "PARTY ISSUES! What has
                    become of them?" he cried. And yet the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> editor did not hesitate to condemn the actions of his own party if they were not
                    acceptable to him. He spoke strongly for freedom of speech and press, writing, "Nor do we
                    intend to allow either to be curtailed or hedged round, in our person or press." Again two
                    years later he asserted his editorial independence. He was even more outspoken in 1853 when he wrote
                    boldly: "We belong to each party as long as we believe its actions right and conducive to
                    the best interests of the masses of the people, and we feel as free to condemn what we consider
                    wrong in the course of the administration of Presidentt Pierce as we approve that which we deem
                    good." By 1864 when the Whigs and Democrats as they were then organized were on their way
                    out as significant political parties, editor Garber said that his party was the masses of the
                        people.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>It was this growing freedom to express in print his convictions regardless of patty affiliation that
                    eventually brought on difficulties between the editor and Senator Bright. When the <hi rend="i">Indiana Statesman</hi> accused Garber of being a Bright underling, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

                    editorially favored the selection of Bright as a representative from <placeName>

                    all the feelings of a man living in a free State…. For our part, as we are a law-loving
                    and law-abiding citizen, should we hear a cry for help to catch a fugitive from bondage, we would
                    turn one deaf ear and blind eye."</p>
            <p>Since Bright believed that his hometown paper should never print anything that was not in accord with
                    his personal views, he apparently influenced the editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana State
                    Journal</hi>, John Defrees, to take Garber to task for printing an editorial so definitely opposed
                    to the views of the senator. Still the editor from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> remained reasonably calm, referring to Defrees as one who "elevated his ears
                    and <hi rend="i">brayed</hi> a four-line paragraph at us, and in those four lines it has managed to
                    tell two lies." Garber admitted differing with the senator on many issues but recognized
                    that Bright was fearless yet aware of the rights of other people.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The senator's attitude toward Garber is quite understandable when one realizes that Bright
                    was an autocrat. He "classed every man as foe who would not do his bidding, and made
                    personal devotion to himself the test of Democracy."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bright was reelected on January 11, 1851. As has been indicated, in the main Garber supported the
                    senator even though he did take issue with him on the slavery question. The first overt act in the
                    quarrel came when the Indiana House of Representatives passed a resolution forbidding distribution
                    of the <hi rend="i">Daily Courier</hi> in the house chambers. NO longer was Garber calm. He lashed
                    out vehemently at the solons: "The 'savans' of the House, it appears,
                    do not like independence and straight-forward dealing in an editor, and have wilfully shut their
                    doors against light and truth. This body, had it the power, would establish a censorship over the
                    Press of the State; and would forbid every article that in the least related to their
                    'high mightiness,' except in terms of praise."<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further differences between Garber and Bright developed when the latter attacked the administration
                    of Governor Joseph A. Wright. Garber cited evidence to show that Bright believed the governor to be
                    a "d—d corrupt scoundrel." He <list type="footnotes">

                    explained that the latest act of the senator was to have nothing more to do with the <hi rend="i">Daily Courier</hi>. Bright had the right to establish his own paper if he so wished, stated
                    Garber, "but what right has he to crush us?"<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As far as the senator was concerned, Garber was neither a loyal Democrat or even a respectable
                    citizen of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In a letter addressed to Judge William M. Taylor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> which was inadvertently delivered to another Taylor, a friend of Garber who turned the
                    letter over to the editor, the senator wrote that Garber is "<hi rend="i">deadly</hi>
                    hostile at heart to me, and has been for the last twelve months" and that he is
                    "too low and corrupt a scoundrel to entitle him to my notice… and I intend to
                    use my efforts to bring about a short peace, which will result in the expulsion of this
                    dam'd scoundrel from our ranks."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the war was in the open. Garber fully understood the basic cause, that he would not "bow
                    down and worship" Bright. This reaction is more clearly explained when one knows that on
                    July 8, Garber was "mad out" of the Democratic party at a meeting in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> courthouae.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally on July 26, 1851, the editor held no punches. He forgot any good that the senator had
                    achieved. The man from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was base and corrupt. He did not even have a basic knowledge of Indiana geography!
                    "Can he tell yon the counties in whose bosom the coal and the iron ore lay now
                    unproductive? Can he tell you the difference between the soils of Jefferson and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>?" Garber's final blow came when he referred to Bright as an
                    "expert political manager," "wire-worker," and
                    "straw-puller."</p>
            <p>A large number of Madisonians, however, were loyal to the editor of the <hi rend="i">Daily

            <p>Meanwhile, Bright was not idle. He called Rolla Doolittle, former <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> editor,
                    back into the newspaper field to edit the new <hi rend="i">Madisonian</hi>, the first issue of which

                    </placeName> D.C., was put in as coeditor. It was Sproule who threw the barbs at Garber and thus
                    greatly precipitated the final episode in this Democratic quarrel.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On January 25, 1862, a public meeting was held to arrange for the coming of the famous Hungarian
                    statesman and patriot, Louis Kossuth, to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Garber and Hamilton Hibbs, a Bright man, were members of the reception committee. A
                    notice signed by Hibbs appeared in the <hi rend="i">Madisonian</hi> on the following day in which he
                    stated that he "would rather be associated with a negro than such men [Garber and hie
                    assistant C. P. Baymiller]." Thus he declined to serve on the committee.</p>
            <p>This was the last straw. Hibbs, a carpenter, was probably told by the <hi rend="i">Madisonian</hi>
                    editor, who well may have written the notice himself, to hang around the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi>
                    office, which was next door to the <hi rend="i">Madisonian</hi> office, to see what Garber would do
                    when he read the notice after issues had been exchanged by the two journals. Another version of the
                    story is that Hibbs was going home from work and "happened" to pass the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> plant exit just as the editor came forth.</p>
            <p>In any case Garber with the latest insult fresh in his mind upon seeing Hibbs spat in his face and
                    struck him. Hibbs quickly pulled a conveniently located chisel and plunged it into
                    Garber's chest. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Banner</hi> of January 29, 1852, described the incident: "At a late hour
                    yesterday afternoon great excitement was produced in our streets by a violent and bloody collision
                    that occurred between M. C. Garber, principal editor of the Courier, and Hamilton Hibbs, in which
                    the former received three very severe, probably mortal, stabs by a chisel in the hand of the
                    latter." The contrite Hibbs came often to the Garber home to learn of the condition of his
                    victim. The <hi rend="i">Daily Courier</hi> published regular reports on its editor's

            <p>The difficulties between Bright and Garber have been developed at some length for several reasons.
                    First, the quarrel shows that the editor was certainly in the stream of personal journalism which
                    was coming to dominate the American journalistic scene through such nationally known figures as the
                    James Gordon Bennetts, Horace Greeley, and Joseph Medill. Then one can see that
                    "Mike" Garber and his <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> represented a potent force in
                    Indiana politics.</p>
            <p>Garber used his editorial columns, however, for other than personal diatribes. He expressed himself
                    vigorously, though not always fluently, on the leading questions of the day. "We hate
                    slavery as much as man can hate sin," he wrote: "and there is only one thing we
                    hate worse than slavery —Disunion." He refused to accept the thesis that the
                    slavery question was a "temporary struggle for political equality." He insisted
                    that the Union was at stake.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>

                    part of the governing power of the country, he is responsible for its policy, and is bound to exert
                    his political influence in behalf of what he considers the right and the true glory of the nation.
                    But he will act from his own convictions, not from the dictations of a party. All political parties,
                    from their very nature, are liable to become corrupted; it is the citizen's duty to see
                    that they do not corrupt him. He will use parties as a means of enforcing his political convictions,
                    but he will be careful that they do not use him. … He who gives up his conscience to the
                    keeping of the party, has made shipwreck of his principles, and becomes a traitor to his country. On
                    the other hand, he who shrinks from politics because they are impure, neglects the duty of a

                    1849. Thus the following tribute, although possibly a little too glowing, describes the Mike Garber
                    of 1849–1866: "Colonel Garber was a strong man, possessing an unusual
                    independence of character and abundant common sense. He thought deeply, read intelligently, and
                    formed his own conclusions. While always reasonable, willing to confer and counsel with others,

                        <p>I rode on the Stage from my home (Napoleon Ind) to Indianapolih— And

                                    stopped at a Farm House and asked if we could get some dinner. A very nice dinner
                                    was Served us for which we were charged 12 1/2 cents each. The cheapness of the

                                    approached a well to-do looking farm house and enquired if he could get
                                    accommodation for his horse &amp; himself for the Night The farmer assented but
                                    told him that they had just had a wedding and they would all sit down to the Wedding
                                    supper, and if he would join them he would be welcome, but they did not have time to
                                    prepare a seperate Supper for him He partook of the wedding Supper— and
                                    Next Morning after a comfortable rest and Breakfast, had his horse brought out, and
                                    asked the farmer how much he should pay for his accommodation. The farmer replied
                                    "you don't think 6 cents too much do you" The bill was
                                    paid and the traveller went on his way—</p>

                                    as Mr Howe's residence. Near the Orchard House, were the only ones which
                                    were paved with brick; the others which were used much, had generally two pieces of
                                    hewn timber laid along, as a substitute for pavements. Such an Ave[nue] we used down
                                    to the Campus— The Court House then was a small square building, located
                                    in the Center of the square, as nearly all the Court Houses were at that time both
                                    in Ind and Ill— The principal business houses, were located on the south
                                    and west sides of the square. indeed I think there were comparatively none or very
                                    few buildings on the other sides, excepting a brick residence on the NW corner. I

                                    noted. I have educated three of my sons, and two daughters at College. And their

                    Flick, published eight, large volumes of the Sir William Johnson Papers, so valuable in American
                    history. These fires emphasized the serious responsibility of those in charge of priceless
                    collections to take greater precautions, especially during work of construction. Every scholar who
                    has used the eight volumes has been dismayed when he came to a key document which was missing, or
                    represented only by the few words left on a scorched letter or report.</p>
            <p>During the past decades, however, large and important collateral collections, such as the Gage and
                    Loudoun Papers, have become available for the first time. In these were many originals or copies of
                    Johnson's correspondence which had been burned, or, in some cases, not kept by him. All
                    such documents, and scattered ones found in many other places, have been gathered with great skill
                    by Dr. Corey and Dr. Hamilton of the Division of Archives and History of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and are now being published in supplementary volumes to the original eight. Volume IX
                    covered the years 1738–1768, and the present one carries the work through 1763. Thus it
                    deals with the campaigns and diplomacy of the French and Indian War, Pontiac's
                    Conspiracy, the Treaty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>

                    settlers. These were the years when Sir William Johnson was at the zenith of his remarkable career.
                    The documents consist preponderantly of the confidential correspondence, both to and from, that
                    passed between Johnson and the highest officials in the colonies, both imperial and colonial, and
                    also with their superiors in <placeName>

                    so decisive in American, British, and world history—will be debtors to Dr. Corey and his
                    staff, and will look forward to the completion of this monumental series, so superbly compiled and
                    edited. This series is a good example of a major phase of work in which every first class, state

                    University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    </placeName>. During those seven seasons several sections of the village area were excavated, six
                    mounds were dug in entirety or in part and a search was carried on for the stockade which should be
                    present. This work was done in the main by students of the University but during two seasons,
                    1939–40 and 1941–42, labor was furnished by the Work Projects Administration.
                    Several advanced students acted in a supervisory capacity during the total time involved and thus
                    gained invaluable experience. The author of this volume was the only person continually associated
                    with the undertaking. He, therefore, is the one person qualified to bring together the vast amount
                    of data resulting from such a large undertaking. Four students contributed appendices in the form of
                    special papers ancillary to the body of the report. In addition to these four there are four others
                    credited upon the title page by reason of their special efforts and contributions in one respect or
                    another.</p>

                    area. If we may assume that the village was coextensive with the mounds then the length was about
                    three thousand seven hundred feet with a width, north and south, of something over one thousand
                    feet. In size it equates with other sites of the same time period and cultural affinity. The site is
                    strategically located between the mouth <pb n="415" id="VAA4025-048-4-089"/> of the <placeName>

            <p>Cole wisely leads the reader into the detailed account of excavations through the medium of a general
                    statement relative to the chronological position of the Kincaid manifestation. It is but a phase of
                    the entire prehistory of the area which goes back a respectable number of years to an initial
                    occupation by a hunting-food-gathering folk who were completely nomadic. Intermediate to the two
                    extremes—migratory vs. sedentary—are expressions of culture not yet too well
                    known in this area. Cole, therefore, is being unduly modest in stating that the chapter is meant for
                    the layman and non-specialist. It is equally of value to the specialist and this is especially true
                    in view of the fact that these poorly known manifestations are described in detail in subsequent
                    chapters.</p>
            <p>I object to the use of the word "contact" in connection with Kincaid. As Cole uses
                    it the word is, in a sense, perfectly proper. He is thinking of the locale as being favorable for
                    contacts to have taken place between the inhabitants of Kincaid and related or unrelated peoples
                    moving through the area by means of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cumberland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, or <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> rivers. However, archaeolcgically, the word contact has come to mean extreme lateness
                    and is usually reserved for aboriginal sites which were being lived upon at the time of initial
                    European visitation or colonization. In this sense Kincaid is definitely not a
                    "contact" site.</p>
            <p>Chapter two is a detailed account of the excavations made during the seven season period. In the
                    village area proper, the approach to investigation was through the medium of methodically located
                    test pits. Several of these were expanded beyond the limits of the original test and "two
                    became major excavations." Floor plans are included as text figures for two of these
                    areas—presumably the ones referred to as "major." These plans point up
                    two facts: (a) the complexity of Middle <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> habitation) areas, and, (b) the futility of attempting to reconstruct so highly a
                    complex pattern of life through the medium of limited excavation. A person who has not excavated
                    such a village cannot conceive of the veritable maze of post holes, house wall trenches, pits,
                    fireplaces, graves, lenses of debris, and lenses of sterile soil the excavator has to find his way
                    through in order to develop the story of intense activity over a long period of time by an extremely
                    active folk. For this reason Cole found it expedient to condense tremendously <pb n="416" id="VAA4025-048-4-090"/> the details of exploration and for the same reason I must do likewise.
                    To one specifically interested in the details of house type, village plan, orientation of dwellings,
                    etc., the published data is disappointing. The day books and notes of the excavators are without
                    doubt available for detailed study but someone should digest them if they have not already been so
                    treated.</p>
            <p>Another aspect of the exploration was disappointing both to the student of comparable sites and to
                    the author and his co-workers. Sites such as Kincaid usually have one or more stockade lines as an
                    integral feature. In this respect Kincaid was probably no exception but the evidence presented is
                    not conclusive.</p>
            <p>Five of the six mounds were of the truncate pyramid type generally thought to have served as
                    foundations for buildings of importance to the villagers. The method of investigation was by
                    trenching and occasional expansion of trenches to include major portions of interval structures as
                    they were encountered. The floor plans resulting from this digging method leave much to be desired
                    but due to the sheer mass of earth involved in total exploration there seems to have been no
                    alternative. Excavation of these mounds which, as usual were erected by stages, provided artifacts
                    which could be accurately relegated to time categories. Some change was noted in architectural
                    details which, in the main, did not differ drastically from the dwellings in the village area.
                    Floors, or "stages" 6, 3 and 2 in Mound -4 produced charcoal specimens which were
                    dated by Bell and in this respect the mound was monumental so far as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Valley archaeology is concerned.</p>
            <p>The sixth mound was apparently erected exclusively for burial purposes. It was explored during four
                    field seasons and the remains of one hundred fifty-five individuals were located. Regrettably all
                    were in such a poor state of preservation that physical studies could not be made.</p>
            <p>The burial mound was of considerable interest and importance for a number of reasons. It was the only
                    concentration of burials found in the Kincaid explorations. The mound was erected upon an older
                    village level—Lewis Component—which, in turn, was superimposed upon material
                    representing the earliest of the pottery making peoples of this area—Baumer Component.
                    The mound was also of interest in that change took place in burial practice within the body of the
                    mound. The lower and oldest burials were in bark and log "tombs" while the upper
                    and most recent burials were in stone lined gravea.</p>
            <pb n="417" id="VAA4025-048-4-091"/>
            <p>Chapter three is devoted to a brief description of Kincaid materials broken down into categories. A
                    discussion of the sources of lithic materials is of value and is based upon a study by Bell. I
                    concur completely with the thesis that raw materials and their sources are as important as the
                    finished product in the interpretation of prehistory. Trade objects, especially pottery, are
                    discussed and these point to contacts with peoples removed a considerable distance from southern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Time periods are also thus indicated which in the main agree with the periods
                    established through other media.</p>
            <p>Interposed between the detailed description of the Kincaid explorations and the Summary and
                    Conclusions, are three chapters which cover the cultural assemblages representing the time period
                    between Kincaid and the pre-ceramic nomadic food gatherers of the earliest period. These are
                    valuable additions to our growing literature on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Valley prehistory.</p>
            <p>The report on Kincaid by Cole ends with a summary in which the site. is placed in its proper position
                    culturally and chronologically. Herein it is also related to comparable components elsewhere in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Valley. A detailed comparison of Kincaid with these other sites would have been welcome
                    but in view of the mass of material which would thus be derived it is understandable why it is
                    omitted. Also regrettable is the fact that correlations between Kincaid as a preliterate expression
                    of culture with linguistic groups of the southeast as expressed in ethnography, or ethnohistory, is
                    lacking.</p>
            <p>The supporting papers in the form of appendices start with one by Robert E. Bell and although all are
                    of importance, his is by far the most valuable. This paper is the best account of the method and
                    procedure followed by the dendrochronologist in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Valley which has come to my attention. An accurate master chart for the eastern red
                    cedar, <hi rend="i">Juniperus virginiana</hi>, now exists for the years from 1450 to 1942. Although
                    such a chart is too recent for much that concerns the archaeologist of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Valley, it is still of vital importance. Also, the present flare for dates derived
                    through the medium of radio-active carbon, should not obscure the importance of dendrochronology.
                    Results obtained from the former method are in some instances open to question and the C-14 dates
                    given to us for Angel Site are too far out of line to repeat in print. Eventually the C-14 dates for
                    recent sites may be forthcoming but even if they are the tree ring method will be more accurate and
                    will not be obsolescent.</p>
            <p>Bell was able to state with finality that Kincaid was occupied from some time prior to 1523 until
                    some time after <pb n="418" id="VAA4025-048-4-092"/> 1613. It is interesting, and gratifying, to
                    note that these actual dates coincide perfectly with "guess dates" previously
                    given for the complex.</p>
            <p>Kenneth G. Orr contributes an appendix covering cultural change within Kincaid. This is based upon
                    the statistical treatment of artifacts, mainly pottery, taken from controlled levels from various
                    portions of the site. He refers to the pottery samples as being taken from "four
                    domiciliary mounds—Mx4, Mx<hi rend="sup">v</hi>1A-35, Mx<hi rend="sup">v</hi>1A-41, and
                        Mx<hi rend="sup">V</hi>1B" yet, with the exception of the first mentioned, all are
                    elsewhere described as "knolls." These would seem to have been spots in the
                    village which had grown from use as dwelling sites or were, in fact, natural elevations which had
                    been lived upon intensively. In either event the end result apparently was not affected for the
                    actual dates derived by Bell verified the statistical conclusions of Orr. The wonder of it is that
                    Orr was able to establish a chronology based upon material taken from intensively occupied sections
                    of the village. And here, may I say again, that a person who has not excavated such a site has no
                    conception of the complexity involved. The formula used for determining the standard of error of one
                    proportion is incorrectly stated on p. 303. This, no doubt, is a typographical error.</p>
            <p>Appendix III, by John W. Bennett, is the Kincaid Designative Trait List. The traits are broken down
                    into "Activity" categories each of which is sub-divided into "Complex,
                    Class and Items." The idea of so dividing the cultural assemblage of a site such as Kincaid
                    is a good one. It leads to the question as to whether or not an archaeological report could be
                    written in terms of a prehistoric ethnology.</p>
            <p>An example of what could be done with much of the material derived from an archaeological excavation
                    is given by Charles G. Wilder in Appendix IV in a study of Kincaid Textiles. The sherds used could
                    have been included only as ceramic traits of the textile marked variety. Wilder, however, has put
                    life into them by demonstrating the weaving techniques involved and how these techniques changed
                    with the passage of time.</p>
            <p>It has been tempting to insert, upon occasion, statements relative to Kincaid as compared to Angel
                    Site. The two are, in the main, identical. There are, however, differences which may reflect
                    variation in time or the relative geographical position of the two sites. There are instances where
                    matters of interpretation of evidence might have been discussed. But this seems not the place for
                    such comments. It is quite obvious that the two sites were built and lived upon by members of the
                        <pb n="419" id="VAA4025-048-4-093"/> same ethnic and linguistic group and that they were
                    coexistent. If we think of such sites in terms of "City-states" then it is
                    possible, indeed probable, that the spheres of influence came together on the peripheries to the
                    east of Kincaid and west of Angel.</p>
            <p>The task so ably completed by Cole was an unenviable one. To write a report upon work performed by
                    one's self is chore enough but to take the notebooks of others and integrate them into a
                    concise and complete account of such a large undertaking is quite another matter. It is a tribute to
                    Cole, that not only did he carry the work to its logical conclusion in the form of this publication
                    but also that he was able to do it. The integration which is so obvious in the report is the result
                    of vision and planning and organization, all of which can be ascribed to Cole since he is the only
                    individual who had a continuous part in the project.</p>

            <p>Mr. Richardson has undertaken an ambitious task and the result is highly creditable for its careful
                    research and 'the insight it gives into a significant phase of Tudor financial
                    administration. While there exist numerous studies on Tudor finance, much remains obscure, and Mr.
                    Richardson has endeavored to do important groundwork on the problem of chamber administration,
                    without which, he states, "no adequate history of the four great revenue courts of the
                    period could be written."</p>
            <p>After giving a survey of the obsolescence, inadequacy, and corruption of the system of exchequer
                    control under Edward IV and Richard III, the author shows how Henry VII bypassed the unwieldy and
                    often inefficient exchequer by setting up and developing the chamber administration, whereby he
                    secured financial independence. This institution established a personal treasury, which became
                    greatly expanded under Henry VIII. After 1487, the practice of directing special types of revenue
                    through chamber channels developed rapidly, and soon standard revenues, formerly paid to the
                    exchequer, were diverted into the chamber. The minute details of this process cannot be mentioned in
                    a review, but they will prove <pb n="420" id="VAA4025-048-4-094"/> of great value to a student of
                    this period. Under Henry VIII the chamber became highly departmentalized and proved itself, in
                    contrast to the exchequer, easily adaptable to change. There arose a division, of audit, an office
                    of wards, an office of liveries, a court of augmentations, a court of first fruits and tenths. Under
                    Henry VIII the chamber received parliamentary sanction. In 1513, chamber payments soared to nearly
                    700,000, while the exchequer expended less than 60,000. Under Mary the court of augmentations, which
                    leased land, sold property, all largely derived from the dissolution of the monasteries, was
                    dissolved and united with the exchequer, and the whole chamber system rapidly disintegrated. It had,
                    however, played a significant part in the development of the strong Tudor monarchy.</p>
            <p>Mr. Richardson deserves credit for his careful research and one is hesitant to find fault with such
                    assiduous accomplishment, but there certainly is overmuch repetition, which could have been avoided
                    in large measure by a more compact arrangement of the material.</p>

            <p>Historians have for many years written about the first military escort to accompany the traders along
                    the Santa Fe Trail in the summer of 1829. Brief accounts have been included in most textbooks on
                    western America. Nevertheless, no adequate investigation of the event, in its historical setting,
                    and using the available manuscript sources of information had been made prior to Mr.
                    Young's study.</p>
            <p>In 1828 Indians killed several traders along the trail, forced others to flee the trace with
                    consequent suffering, and stole cargo worth an estimated thirty to forty thousand dollars. By ways
                    of introduction, the author summarizes these developments, then analyzes the official and public
                    reaction to events which culminated in the assignment of an escort of four companies of the 6th
                    Infantry under Major Bennet Riley for <pb n="421" id="VAA4025-048-4-095"/> the traders the following
                    season. Starting at Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Leavenworth</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the combined party moved westward to Chouteau's Island in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName>, the international boundary. Once across the river the traders, alone for the first
                    time, were attacked by Indians and Major Riley's command, without hesitation, crossed
                    into Mexican territory to render aid. After escorting the merchants beyond the point of danger, the
                    soldiers awaited the caravan's return to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName> and then accompanied it back to Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Leavenworth</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The day-by-day account of this episode is a story of heroism and cowardice. Valuable
                    sidelights on the southwestern fur trade and the military problems on the Indian frontier are
                    likewise provided. Young suggests that this expedition proved oxen were superior to horses and mules
                    as draft animals for the caravans to Santa Fe, and 'that the establishment of a cavalry
                    was essential to the policing of the Plains. The Army gained experience of exceptional value in
                    future operations against the Southwest Indians and for the campaigns of the Mexican War.</p>
            <p>The author has not relied exclusively upon the printed sources of information such as Josiah
                    Gregg's <hi rend="i">Commerce of the Prairies</hi>, Philip St. George Cooke's
                        <hi rend="i">Scenes and Adventures in the Army</hi>, William Waldo's <hi rend="i">Recollections</hi>, William Y. Hitt's <hi rend="i">Narrative</hi>, and other
                    well-known commentaries on the Santa Fe Trail. His book is a contribution to historical literature
                    chiefly because of the extensive use of manuscripts. From The National Archives he has obtained the
                    Report and Journal of Bennet Riley and other pertinent documents. As a result, Young has found
                    conclusive evidence to answer several controversial questions that have plagued historians. Perhaps
                    foremost is the fact that Philip St. George Cooke was the author of both Riley's Journal
                    and Report. Newspaper accounts enliven the story and the printed documents in the Congressional
                    series provide additional authenticity.</p>
            <p>Some matters of style and mechanics may be questioned. Although the account in the <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName> Intelligencer</hi> of October 24, 1928, about the attacks on the Santa Fe traders
                    of that year is both revealing and picturesque, the author is scarcely justified in quoting it twice
                    (p. 25 and p. 34). Some readers may find annoying the interruption of the narrative by the
                    interjection of discussions on sources of information and the evaluation of previous
                    scholars' interpretations and misinformation. In this reviewer's opinion, the
                    discourse on the authorship of the Riley <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> and <hi rend="i">Report</hi> (pp.
                    61–62), the questioning of Ralph Emerson Twitchell's scholarship (pp.
                    63–64), and other academic commentary would have been more at home in <pb n="422" id="VAA4025-048-4-096"/> footnotes. This is, of course, a matter of personal choice, and perhaps
                    overemphasized in the minds of those who have struggled over similar problems.</p>
            <p>The volume is a significant contribution to the history of the Greater Southwest. Young and his
                    mentor, Oscar O. Winther, are to be congratulated for good judgment in selecting a subject for a
                    master's thesis, and subsequent first book, that was circumscribed and therefore
                    manageable. A scholarly approach, a thorough investigation and, above all, the gift of an eminently
                    readable style of writing have been combind to produce an unusually good book.</p>

            <p>"The most dramatic and significant event of the American Revolution in the West was the
                    capture of Lieutenant-Governor Henry Hamilton of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> by tough young George Rogers Clark at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> on February 24th, 1779." With this introductory statement, the editor began
                    his account by sketching the career of Henry Hamilton, a descendant of illustrious ancestors, who
                    entered the army and served under Wolfe during the French and Indian War. As lieutenant governor at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> from April, 1775, until 1779, Hamilton directed the Indian warfare on the western
                    frontiers, the expedition against George Rogers Clark, and the regulation of the fur trade. He was a
                    captive of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> from 1779 to 1781, but on June 21, 1781, three months after his release he reached <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. In 1782 he became lieutenant governor of Quebec, and two years later governor. He was
                    governor of Bermuda from 1787 to 1794 or 1795. A year or more before his death in 1797, he was
                    governor of <placeName>
                        <country reg="dq">Dominica</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Because George Rogers Clark called Hamilton the "Hair-Buyer General," many American
                    writers have made use of this phrase. The editor questions whether Clark was justified in applying
                    this term to Hamilton.</p>
            <p>When Hamilton learned that Clark had captured Kaskaakia and other posts in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> country, he immediately made plans for an expedition against Clark. Accounts on this
                        <pb n="423" id="VAA4025-048-4-097"/> expedition have repeatedly asserted that Hamilton left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> without orders. The editor, however, quotes from several letters by Haldimand in which
                    the latter gave his approval to take such steps as were necessary. An excellent description is given
                    of the journey from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> up, the Maumee and down the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> which required two months.</p>
            <p>As ruler of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
               </placeName> repaired and strengthened Fort Sackville. His attitude
                    towards the people indicates a lack of knowledge and experience. Since they were in the
                    hunter-farmer stage of civilization and some distance from the markets of the world, their
                    commercial activity was slight.</p>
            <p>From time to time parties were sent out to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName> to ascertain the strength of the Americans. While they were on one of these scouting
                    trips, an advanced group of Indians nearly captured Clark and a few of his men. Hamilton was fairly
                    successful in dealing with the Indians between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but he failed to win the tribesmen of the lower <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. The southern Indians also failed to support him. Late in January of 1779 many of the
                    chiefs and warriors who had accompanied Hamilton up the Maumee and down the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> returned to their families in time for the spring planting. The absence of this group,
                    the change in loyalty of the French inhabitants and Indians, and the valuable information about
                    conditions in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which Francis Vigo furnished Clark, set the stage for Hamilton 's capture.</p>
            <p>Clark's heroic march to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> began the first part of February, 1779. When he attacked <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
               </placeName> had only 79 officers and men and only about 33 could be depended
                    upon. A detailed account of Clark's capture of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> is given, Hamilton 's surrender, the hardships, and humiliation of the

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, and his imprisonment at Williams-burg are minutely described.</p>
            <p>In the last chapter "Changes in Evaluation: Hamilton and Clark," the
                    editor's account detracts slightly from the credit due George Rogers Clark, but presents
                    Henry Hamilton in a more favorable light than has been the case heretofore.</p>
            <p>The publication of "The Journal of Henry Hamilton, 1778–1779," the
                    manuscript of which is in the Houghton Library, <placeName>

                    </placeName> University, is a worthy contribution to the knowledge of a colorful phase of the
                    American Revolution.</p>

            <p>Max Ehrmann was born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1872 and died in that city in 1945. He was graduated from DePauw University in 1894,
                    and then spent two years in graduate study at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> University in the department of philosophy. He later studied law and served for a term
                    as Prosecuting Attorney in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vigo County</region>
                    </placeName>, of which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> is the county seat. He then took up work with a factory, remaining at his job for about
                    ten years. It was while he was daily putting in time at the factory office that he devoted his
                    evenings to writing poetry. The remainder of his life he spent in reading, writing, traveling, and
                    thinking—leading a somewhat leisurely existence for thirty or more years.</p>
            <p>The first entry in the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> is dated May 12, 1917. The last entry was written on
                    December 27, 1936. Comparatively few of the entries contain items such as one finds in diaries, but
                    autobiographical matter appears from time to time. No attempt was made to write something each day.
                    There were months in which' only one entry was made. A total of thirty-five scattered
                    months passed during the period from May 12, 1927 and the end of the year 1936, within which months
                    no entries whatever were made. Occasionally the editor of the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> has omitted
                    passages, but every such omission was eliminated from the entry of a single day. No reason is
                    furnished for the editor's omissions, but it seems certain that nothing was deleted to
                    save the author from censure by persons antagonistic to his beliefs or opinions. Had this been the
                    reason for the omissions, a greater number would have been made, since the writer of the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> expressed himself freely in regard to religious, social, political and
                    other problems.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> reveals that Max Ehrmann read widely in the realms of poetry,
                    philosophy, psychology, science, and history. He was much interested in ancient history and in
                    contributions of ancient teachers and writers. He showed no particular interest in current fiction.
                    His own poems, plays and other writings were not designed to win popular applause. Opposite the
                    title-page of the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, the editor has presented a partial list of the
                    published writings of Mr. Ehrmann and has added two titles of publications of her own.</p>
            <p>It seems a bit puzzling that the Ehrmann <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> was not continued or revived after
                    1936, since the author lived until 1946. In her foreword, Mrs. Ehrmann says: "In 1936
                    deeply <pb n="425" id="VAA4025-048-4-099"/> depressed by the oncoming war, Max Ehrmann closed his
                    journal." This may be a correct explanation, but it does not seem adequate. On February 2,
                    1923, the poet-philosopher resumed Writing after four months of inactivity. His explanation of the
                    interval reads: "Several months have passed since I gave up my Journal. I thought never to
                    write in it again, but I need it. I shall continue to write on the wanderings of my mind."
                    One wonders if he did not frequently feel the urge to return to the former method of satisfying his
                    spirit during the stirring years from 1936 to 1945.</p>
            <p>It is not easy to portray the nature of the volume under review. Perhaps a few samplings will help:
                    "What is happening in my inner world is also happening in the inner worlds of the race.
                    Civilized man is moving so fast that he does not how where he is. He is prompted to action by the
                    whisper of new doctrines. There is nowhere to cling, for old convictions oscillate in their grooves,
                    and new things are not yet a brace to hold us steady." (December 21, 1919)</p>
            <p>"Am I opposed to religion? No. Religion is the bread of the soul. The best Christianity of
                    today has abandoned the metaphysics of the Bible, but clings to the ethical teachings of
                    Jesus—love, brother-hood, and service—which are the hope of the
                    world." (June 16, 1922)</p>
            <p>"A Belief may have a thousand years of life behind it, and though we deny it with our
                    tongues, the thing still clings to us. In this farce of tradition many beliefs remain long after
                    every vestige of technical and common sense has been torn out of them." (December 12,
                    1924.)</p>
            <p>"Today I heard a beggar singing on the streets. He sang dreamy ballads in a rich voice. As
                    he had no license, a policeman arrested him. It is a common experience of idealists."
                    (December 19, 1926.)</p>
            <p>"I am moved to rage and pity when I see how extravagantly some of the daughters of the rich
                    live, and with what labor so many poor girls earn a little bitter pleasure." (February 24,
                    1927.)</p>
            <p>"No matter what you are, you will have enemies. Bear them with equanimity. Hate no man. If
                    you must hate, hate unjust institutions." (December 27, 1934.)</p>
            <p>"Like a team of horses running away, mankind seem to be going nowhere in particular at
                    tremendous speed." (September 24, 1930.)</p>
            <p>"The day [Easter] is now significant of a festival of spring, when persons cast off their
                    winter clothing and array themselves in new garments. It is now the festival of the <pb n="426" id="VAA4025-048-4-100"/> merchants. Thus fades away the metaphysics of Jesus but the ethics of
                    the Sermon on the Mount is destined to live on." (April 20, 1919.)</p>
            <p>"This morning I revisited the Criminal Court, where more than thirty years ago, I was the
                    prosecutor. Now another judge sits upon the bench. The bench itself is new. Other reporters, other
                    court officials, other policemen and detectives, other lawyers prosecuting and defending, other
                    endless daily processions of accused. All is changed. No, not all. The smell is the same."
                    (October 19, 1933.)</p>
            <p>My feeling is that any thoughtful reader will find <hi rend="i">The Journal of Max Ehrmann</hi> to be
                    very stimulating and valuable.</p>

            <p>Professor Hurst's autobiography, which is dedicated to his wife, Mabel, and his mother,
                    Elizabeth (he has no children) falls into two major divisions. In the first, constituting about
                    two-thirds of the book, he reviews the highlights of his career as a student, rural school teacher,
                    high school teacher and administrator, and college instructor in the social sciences. Thirty-five
                    years were spent in the latter capacity, including seven at Stout Institute in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, and twenty-four at Ball State Teachers College.</p>
            <p>The second division consists of ten chapters describing extensive travels, largely by automobile, in
                    North America and Europe. With the exception of visits to the Scandinavian countries and Russia, the
                    material in general reflects the usual reactions of tourists who are covering a lot of territory in
                    a short time. The exact cost of having automobile bearings replaced in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> in 1927 seems of no particular significance, to mention one trivial detail which is
                    included.</p>
            <p>Doubtless in an effort to avoid pedantry, the author attempts a kind of journalistic style,
                    particularly in the selection of chapter headings, such as "Aged in the
                    Wood-Shed," "Curlicuricular Activities," "Isaac <hi rend="i">[sic]</hi> Waltons," "Insouciance Abroad," and "Throwing
                    the Bull." Some readers will feel that in an effort to write in a popular vein, the author
                    goes in too much for earthy stories and allusions, of which the following is an example: <pb n="427" id="VAA4025-048-4-101"/>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">

            </p>
            <p>At times the vocabulary and sentence structure, an illustrated by the following excerpts, may invite
                    criticism from academicians and journalists alike:</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">

                    <p>"When a boy, fox hunters used to pass our house." (P. 80)</p>
                    <p>"One evening, as we were leaving the State Horn where we were working my pal and I
                        accidentally fell in with this little Miss." (p. 120)</p>
                </quote>
            <p>The author disclaims any intention of writing an educational history or a philosophical treatise.
                    Nevertheless, the chapters dealing with the rural schools of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and his reactions to collegiate instructors and school administrators constitute
                    outstanding features of the book, in the opinion of the reviewer.</p>
            <p>He rates his instructors at the Indiana State Normal School, as the best observed, on the whole, of
                    any college attended. He considers President William W. Parsons "intellectual, imperious
                    able and often petty" and a master in his field of history and philosophy of education. He
                    declares that Vice President Howard Sandison had a limited formal education "but his
                    erudition was so varied and deep that some of our college presidents of today would not know what he
                    was talking about." Hurst also speaks highly of his instructors in Latin, mathematics, and
                    history.</p>
            <p>As a graduate student he studied under a galaxy which included Clarence W. Alvord, Solon J. Buck,
                    Carl R. Fish, Evarts B. Greene, James W. Gamer, Samuel B. Harding, Amos Hershey, J. Franklin
                    Jameson, Dana C. Munro, Albert H. Lybyer, David Muzzey, Frederic L. Paxson, Elihu Root, W. S.
                    Robertson, Robert Schuyler, Ulysses G. Weatherley, and James A. Woodburn. Alvord influenced him the
                    most because of the objectivity, industry, and perseverance which "kept him in pursuit of a
                    problem till he found the answer." Paxson is considered <pb n="428" id="VAA4025-048-4-102"/> the best lecturer of the group. He praises Woodburn for his inspiring teaching and wholesome
                    liberalism. He also speaks highly of Garner, Jameson, Harding, and <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The author had considerable experience in public school administration but chose college teaching for
                    a variety of considerations, one being his low opinion of administrators, whom he did not find to be
                    "either particularly honorable or honest" because of the necessity of being
                    politicians first and schoolmen second. On the college level he saw many men and women discharged:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>… The charges against them were petty and personal in nearly every case. My
                            observance has been that the best teachers are more likely to lose their positions than the
                            mediocre ones, though not as likely to lose them as the poorest teachers. (p. 46)</p>

                        (1824–1901</hi>). By James B. McNair. (Los Angela, <placeName>

                    $7.50.)</head>
            <p>This collection of somewhat disconnected information concerning the genealogy, religious background,
                    "masonic career" and other seemingly more important aspects of the life of this
                    admirable early American engineer and mine manager is apparently a labor of love of one of his
                    descendanta. It appears to be a conscientious effort to record with plentiful documentation the
                    significant details of the career of one's highly esteemed forebear, particularly the
                    facts that add luster to the family name.</p>
            <pb n="429" id="VAA4025-048-4-103"/>
            <p>Among the more notable achievements of Thomas S. McNair appears to be his idea for the development of
                    an inclined mine transit, made to his order, and his service as engineer in the surveying work
                    required for the 16,000 feet long Jeddo mine drainage tunnel which in 1894 reclaimed for use a large
                    mine that had been flooded by an overflowing stream in a great storm, the water entering the mine
                    shaft.</p>
            <p>Many mine surveys were made by Mr. McNair always with great accuracy. To underscore the importance of
                    such accuracy in mine surveying a dramatic story is vividly told of a mine disaster which resulted
                    from inaccurate surveying or inaccurate recording of a survey by another, <hi rend="i">not</hi> Mr.
                    McNair. In this catastrophe 13 men lost their lives by drowning after a blast which was set off too
                    close to an adjacent flooded abandoned mine. The inaccurate map had indicated the flooded mine shaft
                    to be 90 feet farther away than it was. The coroner's jury rendered a verdict setting
                    forth the facts just given, but named no one as the guilty party. Presumably the families of the
                    miners received no damages.</p>
            <p>Several pages are devoted to Mr. McNair's views on "Coal Strikes and Labor
                    Unions." One searches the pages in vain for evidence that the engineer might show sympathy
                    for the hazardous, difficult life and poor living standard of the coal miners. Although he appears
                    to understand them he ascribes conditions to "hard times." Even when "50
                    were shot by the Deputies—11 killed and 39 wounded. Several of the wounded died
                    afterwards"—his indignation is directed only against the "labor
                    agitators" and "parties who were making cat paws of these foreign born
                    people." He does add in his letter of 1897 from which these excerpts have been taken:
                    "I pity these poor people who suffered at Lattimer. The parties who should have suffered
                    have left them."</p>
            <p>This reviewer, however, who knows something of present day attitudes toward "labor
                    agitators" and coal miners does not feel inclined to judge harshly the not dissimilar views
                    of early engineers.</p>
            <p>Do not social views improve less rapidly than technology and corporate ethics also?</p>
            <p>The following is a quotation from Mr. McNair to M. A. M. Passmore written on behalf of the widow of a
                    brother free mason, "It has come to my knowledge that the M—Life Insurance
                    Company of which you hold the agency, and I also a policy, are' disposed to contest the
                    payment of a policy due to the widow of the late Mark McAllister…. It does not seem to be
                    exactly the right thing for a company to continue to <pb n="430" id="VAA4025-048-4-104"/> receive
                    the premium on a policy year after year without any demurer or exception on their part and when the
                    event occurs for which it was intended to provide, at one look about for some excuse to avoid the
                    payment of the policy to the widow. …"</p>
            <p>Following the bringing of suit and postponement of the trial "it was understood that the
                    M—Life Assurance Company was willing to settle out of court by paying the widow $500 and
                    paying for the costs of the trial"—despite the fact that more than $3500 had
                    been paid in premiums. "Mr. McNair dropped his life insurance policy No. 26648A"
                    with that company. But, the company grew and prospered, nevertheless.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears that the social conscience of this engineer could be aroused against an unjust
                        corporation—<hi rend="i">not his employer</hi>—on behalf of a fellow
                    mason's widow if <hi rend="i">not for the "foreign-born miners"</hi>
                    under his employ.</p>
            <p>There is a fascination in delving into quaint repositories of ancient anecdote and naive verbiage.
                    This is an excerpt from a letter to McNair's son Tom: "No objection to your
                    going to any other orthodox church (than the Presbyterian) but there can be no good reason for going
                    back on the old faith. It's people are generally as intelligent and influential as any
                    other." This book, unlike Presbyterians, will not be influential, but is as intelligent as
                    many another. As an engineer—and for reasons somewhat unorthodox—I enjoyed it.</p>

            <p>Before a house of worship was constructed, these Brown County citizens held services in their homes.
                    Just when the first church was built is not known, but the land for this frame structure was a gift
                    from the Waltman family, and the lumber was sawed at the Thomas Waltman Lumber Mill, east of <placeName>

                    made use of this house of worship until a few years ago when it was sold to the Mennonites.</p>
