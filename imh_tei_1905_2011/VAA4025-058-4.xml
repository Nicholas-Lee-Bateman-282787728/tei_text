            <p>Education in Indiana at all levels was largely under church and private auspices in the pioneer era
                    (approximately 1800–1850), and especially during the first quarter of the nineteenth
                    century. Public education developed during the ensuing quarter century, but early public schools
                    were seldom free schools. Indiana University, first known as Indiana State Seminary, opened in the
                    mid-twenties. Most counties established and operated a county seminary for varying <list type="footnotes">

                            village in Congressional Township 13 North, Range 7 East. He was educated in the local

                    public institutions at the secondary level. The date for the opening of the first public school at
                    the elementary level is unknown, but this milestone was probably achieved during the late teens or
                    early twenties. At any rate, the significant beginnings of public education in
                    Indiana—elementary, secondary, and collegiate—are found almost exclusively
                    during the second quarter of the nineteenth century.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>The Land Ordinance of 1785 established the cornerstone for public elementary education in the Hoosier
                    State. Although this congressional ordinance had immediate application to only a limited area of the
                    federal domain in eastern <placeName>

                    </placeName> next to the Pennsylvania border, it made the congressional township the basic unit in
                    the rectangular system of surveying federal land in the larger region to the west that included the
                    Indiana Territory and began the practice of setting aside the sixteenth section of each
                    congressional township (one thirty-sixth of the township) for "the maintenance of public
                    schools" therein.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> As Indian titles were removed and the federal land
                    surveys proceeded westward the sixteenth sections or their equivalents were reserved from sale. When
                    Indiana became a state in 1816 the <placeName>

                    school section was expressly "granted to the inhabitants of such township, for the use of
                        schools."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Even though a congressional township might include parts
                    of two or more civil townships, or even two or more counties, its school section belonged
                    exclusively to its residents.</p>

            <p>Indiana's first state constitution, quickly drafted at Corydon during June of 1816,
                    established a goal and a commitment to public education which was advanced for its day. This
                    constitution included the qualified mandate: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It shall be the duty of the General assembly, as soon as circumstances will permit, to
                            provide, by law, for a general system of education, ascending in a regular gradation, from
                            township schools to a state university, wherein tuition shall be gratis, and equally open to

                  </p>
                    </quote>The express mention of township schools in this mandate was probably a result of the
                    donation of the sixteenth sections for support of local schools. Unfortunately the goal established
                    in the constitution was beyond the ability of the pioneers to realize.</p>
            <p>The Constitution of 1816 made it the duty of the legislature to provide for the improvement of the
                    school sections and it also prohibited their sale before the year 1820.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The
                    Indiana territorial legislature had already enacted laws to protect these sections from illegal

                    election of a school commissioner for each county who would receive payments from these sales. From
                    these receipts he was empowered to lend the principal and distribute the interest to the schools
                    entitled to it. Following this enabling legislation the residents of many congressional townships
                    sold at least a portion of their school lands. The proceeds from these sales in each township
                    constituted its Congressional Township Fund as a permanent endowment from which only the interest

                    taxes—normally payable in labor, produce, or cash—could be levied by qualified
                    voters of school districts, though legislation limited the maximum rates which could be assessed.
                    Local taxes might be used to build schoolhouses, to pay teachers when other revenue was inadequate,
                    or to extend school terms. During the thirties and forties the state developed various funds which
                    were known collectively as the Common School Fund, and the proceeds thereof were distributed to
                    local schools. The Surplus Revenue Fund, consisting of "surplus revenue" from land
                    sales distributed by the federal government, was by far the most valuable of these funds prior to
                    the 1850's.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>In 1810 the Indiana territorial legislature authorized the establishment of schools within
                    congressional townships and early state legislatures repeated this authorization.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> But the first major—and possibly the first fruitful—legislation
                    regarding the opening of schools was that of 1824 which provided for the election of three
                    congressional township trustees and their incorporation as a body politic in general charge of local
                    schools as in previous legislation. The 1824 law began the practice of dividing townships into
                    districts with sub-trustees in immediate charge of the schools. The three township trustees were
                    authorized to divide their township into an appropriate number of school districts, appoint three
                    sub-trustees for each district, and examine and certify qualified teachers. The sub-trustees were
                    empowered to build a schoolhouse and employ a teacher for a term of at least three months provided
                    local householders and freeholders approved. The district system with much authority to local
                    trustees apparently continued throughout the pioneer period. Subsequent legislation was largely an

            <p>By the early 1830's the time was ripe for the establishment of public elementary schools in
                    Township 13, Range 7 East. The document which follows illustrates the general process and the basic
                    steps by which such schools were usually founded in Indiana in pioneer days. It begins with an entry
                    under date of September 12, 1829, recording a meeting of the three township trustees to set the
                    minimum price at which tracts might be sold from the school section. This meeting indicates that the
                    trustees had previously been elected and the township incorporated as a body politic, and it also
                    suggests that local voters had already approved selling their school land. The next major step came
                    in 1832 when the trustees divided the township into six school districts and appointed three
                    sub-trustees for each district—making a total of twenty-one trustees and sub-trustees for
                    an area only six miles square!</p>
            <p>The remainder of the document principally relates the work and efforts of the trustees and
                    sub-trustees to establish and sustain local schools. The first important task of the sub-trustees
                    was to call a meeting to determine whether local residents would or would not like to establish a
                    school. If the vote was favorable, the sub-trustees supervised the erection of a schoolhouse,
                    usually made of logs. If the township trustees accepted the building, the district trustees
                    contracted with a teacher concerning his pay, length of the school term, and related items. The
                    actual selection of the teacher rested with the sub-trustees, but he had also to be approved either
                    by the township trustees or by a county official or officials. If the revenue available was
                    inadequate to pay the school costs, the sub-trustees levied local taxes payable in cash, produce, or
                    labor.</p>
            <p>Neighborhood self-sufficiency characterized public elementary schools as it did other aspects of
                    pioneer life and culture. Since the revenue from a school section belonged to the residents of the
                    congressional township, this township—rather than the civil township—became a
                    basic unit for schools. The importance of the congressional township as a school unit was increased
                    because revenue from the school section was the principal source of money for schools, especially in
                    the early years. Moreover, by following survey lines or by drawing other lines with reference to
                    them, a congressional township could be divided easily into school districts with <pb n="286" id="VAA4025-058-4-012"/> readily understood boundaries.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Because schools
                    had to be within walking distance of their "scholars," congressional townships
                    were usually divided into from four or five to seven or eight districts. Their number was determined
                    by such factors as the number and distribution of scholars, the extent of local interest in schools,
                    the location of rivers, and other physical features, the amount of money available to sustain
                    schools from the Congressional Township Fund and other sources, and at times by the whims and
                    pressures of local citizens. This decentralized district system—with considerable
                    authority given to the district trustees—has been much criticized by school
                    administrators and by historians, particularly during the twentieth century, but, despite its
                    faults, it or something like it was perhaps essential in the pioneer era.</p>

                            indicate flourishes around signatures; the word "seal" which appears
                            regularly after signatures on bonds and occasionally elsewhere has not been reproduced.
                            Since spacing and form varied greatly with different clerks, it has been considered
                            desirable to standardize indention, spacing, closing signature arrangement, and location of
                            headings. An occasional prepositional phrase has been omitted in the process of
                            standardizing identifying initials or titles in an item. Limited space has prompted the
                            printing of long lists of names in double columns rather than the single columns which
                            usually occur in the minute book.</p>
                        <p>Topical and running headings were used with varying consistency by the different clerks.
                            Existing topical headings have been retained; where the clerks omitted topical headings they
                            have been supplied in brackets. Running headings have been omitted except where they could
                            be used as topical headings; if it was necessary to relocate or rearrange them, they have
                            been bracketed. The decision to use large and small capitals for all general item headings
                            was based on the appearance of the printed page; here also the capitalization of the

                            of the surplus revenue and other school funds in the township treasury, the number of school
                            children in that district must have been reported to the township trustees. The district
                            trustees then ordered that the township clerk give the district treasurer an order on the
                            township treasurer for the proportion of the school funds to which that district was
                            entitled under the formula in effect at the time of distribution; these district orders or
                            warrants were usually prepared by the district clerks. The warrants of three districts do
                            not appear in this series because those districts had not reported their numbers of scholars
                            in time; by the September, 1844, semi-annual distribution all had apparently reported and
                            all issued warrants. Because of limited space, beginning with the September, 1844,
                            distribution (p. 347), the texts of the warrants are omitted and only the distribution date

            <p>These two volumes constitute the first installment of the colossal effort at publishing a complete,
                    scholarly edition of the papers of James Madison. The effort involves the collaboration of a number
                    of individuals, libraries, universities, historical organizations, and foundations. The editors are
                    attempting to print in chronological order every paper of any significance that they can find that
                    is probably in whole or in part the product of Madison's mind whether written by him or
                    quoted from him and summarized by someone else. Also included are papers submitted to him that
                    presumably received his careful attention.</p>
            <p>In the first volume the editors give a description of their methods; a history of movements of the
                    papers; an account of previous efforts at publishing selections, including the efforts of Madison at
                    selecting, arranging, correcting, and discarding; and a table of contents listing in chronological
                    order each paper. In this volume appear few papers that in themselves are too important. There are
                    some notes that Madison had taken from his reading of treatises; some thirty letters that passed
                    between him and William Bradford, son of the famous publisher, during the period between his
                    graduation from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName> College and his service in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Revolutionary convention; his amendment to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Bill of Rights concerning religious liberty; and some thirty warrants and orders signed
                    by Madison and other members of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Council of State while he was a member of that body in 1778–1779. The
                    earlier letters between Madison and Bradford discuss the whereabouts of their former college
                    classmates and their own uncertainties about choosing a vocation. But by 1773 Madison becomes
                    excited over religious persecution of dissenters in his state and associates church establishment
                    with oppression and loss of liberty in general. By 1774 the letters are filled with support of
                    resistance to Britain.</p>
            <p>The second volume is composed almost entirely of papers originating while Madison was one of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> delegates to the Continental Congress during the last year of its existence. He was a
                    member of some twenty of that body's committees and chairman of a few important ones. He
                    with others signed the reports of these committees and offered motions in their behalf to Congress.
                    Some of these reports and motions can be identified as being primarily of his authorship. He with
                    other members of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s delegation signed reports to the governor and to the general assembly of
                    that state. He drafted the instructions to John Jay and to Henry Laurens, the ministers who assisted
                    Franklin and Adams in negotiating the preliminary Treaty of Peace with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <pb n="374" id="VAA4025-058-4-100"/>
            <p>The value of the papers may be divided into at least two classes. Some of the papers are such that by
                    themselves they give the historian the answer to an important question. Such are the documents
                    revealing the evidence of Madison's devotion to religious liberty; the evidence of his
                    attitude on the cession of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s western lands; and the evidence of his defense, in his instructions to Jay,
                    of claiming the West up to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> and the freedom of navigation on that stream. The other value of the papers comes from
                    reading all the documents in succession. The reader will then be impressed through the repetition of
                    the statements of certain facts in all kinds of documents by all kinds of writers. Lack of swift and
                    accurate communication is revealed in these documents. In the midst of Revolutionary struggle no one
                    seemed to know accurately what was going on. Again and again rumors of military engagements,
                    movements of armies and fleets were followed weeks later by reports that the rumors were unfounded.
                    There was repeated mention of jealousy by one state of another, of suspicion by Americans of the
                    motives of their allies, of rivalry between factions in Congress and in states, and of mistrust of
                    political leaders. The reader will be impressed by the repeated references to the economic anarchy
                    and the confusion caused by the currency. He will be amused at the lack of organization in
                    forwarding supplies and raising recruits and then probably puzzled that no one mentions the
                    possibility of quitting.</p>
            <p>The editorial work has gone about as far or high as such a thing could go. The net has been spread
                    far and wide to drag in everything written by or to Madison that can be uncovered at this time. The
                    footnotes at the end of each item, on the average, occupy as much space in the book as the original
                    document itself and in most cases contain many times as much information. The footnotes attempt
                    adequately to identify every proper name, explain words and statements that might not be understood
                    by the general reader, state the difference of views on controversial questions, and cite in
                    bibliographical completeness the authorities for the contributions in the footnotes. The volume
                    includes maps of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> giving rivers, counties, and places for the period of Madison's life. There
                    are portraits of pertinent personalities. The index is complete and usable with cross-references
                    that make it almost impossible to fail to find quickly anything in the writings or footnotes that is
                    there. It is to be hoped that this work will be carried to its completion on the level on which it
                    has been begun.</p>

                        1760–1775.</hi> By Jack M. Sosin. (Lincoln: The University of <placeName>

            <p>This is a book with a thesis—or, rather, several of them. It sets out to revise, in
                    certain important respects, the interpretation of British policy in the west between 1763 and 1776
                    that is set forth in C. V. <pb n="375" id="VAA4025-058-4-101"/> Alvord's classic <hi rend="i">The <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> in British Politics.</hi> … Mr.
                    Sosin almost completely dismisses the possibility that ideas or theories as such had any significant
                    impact on British colonial policy. On the contrary, "British ministers were primarily
                    administrators who arrived at particular solutions for specific problems as they arose, although
                    they may have phrased their decisions in the terminology of mercantilist doctrine" (p. x).
                    Mr. Sosin does share Professor Alvord's belief that the chief concern of the British
                    ministers dealing with the colonies in these years was the administration of territories acquired by
                    the Treaty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> and not the seaboard provinces, at least until the violent colonial resistance to the
                    ministerial and parliamentary measures with regard to the west forced the ministry to concentrate
                    upon maintaining imperial authority. Actually, the area discussed is roughly that which came to be
                    called the Old Northwest. Because, says the author, of the excellence of other treatments of the
                    southern frontier, little attention is paid here to that area.</p>
            <p>The story begins with a chapter on the issues in the negotiations of the Treaty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> that pertained to the west. Now that the western territories in America had been
                    acquired "for the security of the American colonists" the ministers set out
                    "to insure this goal"! Regular troops would protect the continent. Taxes raised in
                    America would pay their expenses. "The decision to adopt these measures … was to
                    lead to the disruption of that [the first British] Empire in the American Revolution" (p.
                    25). But policy was determined by practical experience.</p>
            <p>With the unexpected outbreak of colonial resistance and violence after the Stamp Act and the renewed
                    opposition to the measures of 1767 and 1768, the mother-country's problem became a double
                    one. For now, in addition to the still unresolved problem of the west, the ministry was faced with a
                    persistent and organized colonial resistance to imperial authority.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the pressure of the land speculators upon the ministry was constant, varied, and very
                    powerful. Partly in response to this pressure, partly in the hope of pacifying the Indians, and
                    partly because of the desire to economize in the administration of the west, the ministry decided,
                    in 1768, to revise the boundary line westward, to evacuate several of the western posts, and to
                    return control of the Indian trade to the individual colonies. But the failure of the colonial
                    assemblies to provide any workable administration of the western problem, coupled with the confusion
                    in governmental circles in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, resulted in chaos on the western frontier. At last, almost in desperation, the
                    ministry decided to turn over the problem of the frontier north of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to Quebec, "the only colony which had demonstrated an ability to get along
                    with the native tribes" (p. 238). The Quebec Act was thus a final phase of British policy
                    with regard to the west, one which represented an abandonment of the "imperial"
                    policy of administration of the northwest in favor of assigning that responsibility to a single
                    colony that could be depended upon.</p>
            <p>It is a useful book based upon a vast reading and careful, thoughtful sorting of documentary
                    materials; it is one written in extreme detail. The reviewer recognizes its value; but he cannot
                    believe that there were <pb n="376" id="VAA4025-058-4-102"/> no statesmen, that there was no genuine
                    theory or vision involved in the conception and execution of British policy during these years,
                    either in America or in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. It is his belief that the broader evidence indicates otherwise.</p>

            <p>Here is a masterpiece of editorial sleuthing: editor Smith has solved the May manuscript mystery. For
                    years historians have been victims of the editorial ineptitude of Reverend Richard S. Edes, grandson
                    of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> merchant, John May, whose western journals Smith has restored to reputability. After
                    editing (emasculating) for publication in 1873 his grandfather's original of the 1788
                    journey, Reverend Edes felt obliged to destroy the original manuscript. He also presumed to say that
                    there was no journal for the 1789 trip. Recently the Historical and Philosophical Society of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> acquired manuscripts claimed to be the originals of both. Editor Smith has demonstrated
                    that the 1788 manuscript by an unknown scribe was a more faithful copy than the Edes product. He has
                    also shown that the 1789 manuscript is the original itself. There is a lacuna of a half
                    month's entries at the end of the 1788 manuscript, caused by the failure of the copyist to
                    complete the job. Smith has, therefore, added a patch from Reverend Edes.</p>
            <p>The May story is an excellent account of how one easterner found the westward movement unprofitable.
                    John May (1748–1812) was a Bostonian of affluence, a merchant, and a shipper. He
                    "attended" the Boston Tea Party of December 16, 1773, and was an officer in a
                    Boston regiment during the Revolutionary War. He became a stockholder, agent, and landholder in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Company of Associates in 1787, and spent two years trying to make the venture
                    profitable to the company and himself.</p>
            <p>May proved to himself the hard way that in the late 1780's a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> merchant of affluence could maintain that position better by staying in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> than by going West. He arrived at <placeName>

                    calculated for an elegant City" (p. 48). He completed the first frame house in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Marietta</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which he designed as a residence, a tavern, and a storehouse (p. 63). He then returned

                    </placeName> determined to come out the next year with merchandise sufficient to set up a store.</p>
            <p>The journal of 1789 is a blow-by-blow account of a losing struggle. He shipped his goods from <placeName>

                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he organized a wagon train and "stood for the Wilderness" on
                    May 11 (p. 93). A "Terrible Tornado" blocked his way a few miles east of Redstone
                    Old Fort. About the same time the reported "Downfall of Gensang" delayed him
                    further as he sought to confirm this disaster to his selling power (p. 138). By the time he was able
                    to get his goods on a "Kentuc <pb n="377" id="VAA4025-058-4-103"/> Boat" the

            <p>Mr. Van der Linden remarks in the Foreword that his book tells us two stories. The first story
                    concerns itself with "the Revolution of 1800" and the second with "the
                    romance between Margaret Bayard and Samuel Harrison Smith." Neither story is handled well.
                    Nothing new is added and much is omitted from the account of Jefferson's election in 1800.

                    </placeName> Press, 1957), which would have added much to the background, was magnificently ignored.
                    As for the love letters that Mr. Van der Linden "discovered," it is certain that
                    the Library of Congress knew that they were there all the time, and they do not in any way
                    "reveal what actually happened in the bitter political conflicts of the years between 1796
                    and 1801."</p>
            <p>The presentation is usually felicitous, but sometimes turns saccharine. The attempt "to
                    paint a picture of American life in the age of Thomas Jefferson" occasionally comes off
                    well and the chapter dealing with the actual voting in the House of Representatives that February,
                    1801, is the best descriptive writing in the book because the author allows the participants to tell
                    their own story. Each quotation is carefully footnoted at the end of the volume, a cursed practice,
                    but all too often the temptation to extemporize becomes too great. Mr. Van der Linden tells us that
                    "no doubt" Samuel H. Smith called on Jefferson (p. 237), a slight matter without
                    evidence and perhaps not needing any, but on the very same page he also tells us that "no
                    doubt" Jefferson "supplied the paper [Smith's <hi rend="i">National
                        Intelligencer</hi>] with the latest news." Evidence is essential in this latter case.</p>
            <p>Trust in the material presented is not built without the historian's handmaiden called
                    source, nor is that confidence lightly regarded until abused. The reader's faith is shaken
                    badly when he is boldly told that "Jefferson secretly drafted a series of resolutions which
                    were adopted by the legislatures of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    </placeName> late in 1798" (p. 127). Irving Brant, the editors of the Madison Papers,
                    Adrienne Koch, and <pb n="378" id="VAA4025-058-4-104"/> any reader reasonably well acquainted with
                    the far-from-little-known facts of American history will all be appalled to see one of the mainstays
                    of James Madison's claim to rank as a philosopher of Republicanism so blithely attributed
                    to his fellow Virginian. The editor, particularly of a new publishing house, should have caught such
                    an error even if the author knew not what he had done.</p>
            <p>There is a drama in the election of 1800 and there is romance between the two young lovers, Margaret
                    and Samuel, but the skeins of the two themes are not mutually interdependent and the attempt to bind
                    the two stories confuses the first without shedding light on it and makes the second look
                    ridiculous. Margaret Bayard wrote some interesting love letters and Jefferson was elected, but the
                    latter was conceded before the book was written and the letters do not change either the reasons or
                    the fact of the election.</p>

                    mine of information concerning relations with the Indians and the British during this period of
                    frontier conflict. The notes, the preface, and the conclusion are evidently the result of patient
                    research and scholarship. Those interested in the policy of the government of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> concerning the Indians on the frontier of the Old Northwest, in the abortive attempts
                    to educate and to civilize the Indians, in the fruitless negotiations with Tecumseh and The Prophet
                    in the months prior to the outbreak of the War of 1812, and in the equally fruitless attempts to
                    retain the friendship and the support of the Indian tribes at the same time, will find this book
                    most valuable.</p>
            <p>Those merely interested in fiction-like history will find that, also, merely by reading between the
                    lines. The confused and disorganized relationship between the Indian agent, the factor, and the
                    military commander at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> led to petty bickerings and rivalries which are often reflected in the letters of the
                    agent. Of even more interest is the relationship of the succeeding agents one to the other. William
                    Wells was appointed as assistant agent for Indian affairs in Indiana Territory in 1802 with his
                    residence at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In the same year, John Johnston was named factor of the Indian trading house. In 1809,
                    after seven years of "petty politics, intrigues, jealousies, etc., that permeated the
                    internal affairs of the Indian Department" (pp. 13–14), Wells was removed as
                    agent and replaced by Johnston. Wells, to this reviewer, has long been a favorite character and was,
                    as Miss Thornbrough states, a controversial figure. We are indebted to the author for an excellent,
                        <pb n="379" id="VAA4025-058-4-105"/> though much too short, history of Wells' agency
                    and his eventual removal.</p>
            <p>The letter book begins with Johnston's appointment in 1809 to the Indiana Territory Agency.
                    It continues through the years of his agency (1809–1812) and the first three years
                    (1812–1815) of the agency of Benjamin F. Stickney who replaced Johnston when the latter
                    moved to the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, agency. Miss Thornbrough, in her introduction, in her notes, and in her review of the
                    last three years (1815–1818) of Stickney's agency, has done an excellent job of
                    maintaining objective neutrality when discussing the rivalries between Johnston and Wells and
                    between Johnston and Stickney. For purely romantic reasons, and with most of the facts of the case
                    arrayed against him, this reviewer has always been sympathetic toward Wells and Stickney. Surely, a
                    case could be made for the view that Johnston connived and schemed for seven years to poison the
                    minds of Governor William Henry Harrison and Secretary of War Henry Dearborn against Wells in order
                    to become agent at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Then, from 1815 to 1818, he repeated the performance to get rid of Stickney and to

                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> agencies under his control. However, to take sides on such an issue as that in such a
                    work as this would have been improper, and Miss Thornbrough is to be applauded for her objectivity
                    and for her contribution to those who may, at a later date, desire to interpret history.</p>

            <p>The quarter century which Father Trisco treats in this scholarly study was a critical era in the
                    history of the Catholic Church in the Middle West. He defines the Middle West loosely as
                    "the region stretching from the Alleghenies to the Rockies except the South." In
                    1826 the Catholic population of the area approximated 7,500 in three dioceses. By 1850 it exceeded
                    400,000 in eleven dioceses—a fifty-threefold increase in twenty-five years.</p>
            <p>Father Trisco has valid reasons for selecting 1826 as the starting date and 1850 as the closing date
                    for his study. In 1826 Mauro Cappellari accepted the directorship of the Sacred Congregation de
                    Propaganda Fide, the papal agency concerned with administration and expansion of the mission fields
                    in the world. In that year the erection of the Diocese of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> made the Western Church juridically distinct from the rest of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Then too, the early history of the three trans-Allegheny dioceses
                            (<placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Bardstown</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>) has already been adequately treated. The year 1850 seems to be a logical concluding
                    date for Father Trisco's specialized study. It was the year of the death of Benedict Joseph
                    Flaget, the first bishop of the Middle West. In 1850, moreover, the first two metropolitan provinces
                    were established in the trans-Allegheny country. And by 1850 the Church was flourishing and had come
                    of age—it could no longer be classed as "nascent."</p>
            <pb n="380" id="VAA4025-058-4-106"/>
            <p>Approximately half of the volume deals with three general subjects: the dioceses, the bishops, and
                    the clergy. The papacy was most responsive to boundary changes requested by the American bishops.
                    "If the appointment of suitable bishops was one of the important ways of fostering the
                    nascent Church," concludes Father Trisco (p. 166), "the Holy See must in general
                    be praised for its efforts to choose the best candidates." He also lauds the
                    Propaganda's activity "to strengthen the Western clergy in quantity and
                    quality" (p. 224).</p>
            <p>The last three chapters deal with the material aid the papacy gave the young Western Church. Too
                    little space is given to the contributions of the religious orders and their educational efforts,
                    although the tragic story of the Poor Clares is presented in great detail and most objectively. The
                    chapter on "Discipline" is devoted chiefly to the troubles and resignation of
                    Frederick Rese, first Bishop of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The published work, in the main, comes out of a doctoral dissertation presented to the Pontifical
                    Gregorian University in 1959. It was based in a large measure upon manuscript materials in the
                    Vatican Library, especially the extensive files of the Propaganda's archives. It is written
                    from the point of view of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but by an historian who has an excellent acquaintance with the American Church history
                    of the 1820–1860 era. It is a study of the Church internal, and the political and
                    non-religious facets (in this reviewer's opinion) receive too little space and attention.
                    It is almost as if the Church existed in a vacuum. Although such subjects as sectionalism and
                    slavery, the Indian problem, and Know-Nothingism and bigotry receive mention in the Introduction,
                    these are bypassed in favor of a discussion of topics upon which the papal archives shed more light.</p>
            <p>The many footnotes attest to the intensity of research and the erudition of the author. Many are
                    Latin excerpts from the sources; some cite French and Italian documents.</p>
            <p>The book is a kind of historian's history. It is an important chapter in Midwestern history
                    and in Catholic Church history. It is Father Trisco's first monograph, and it reveals a
                    depth of scholarship which presages a bright future for a budding historian of the Catholic Church
                    in America.</p>

            <p>Professor Hine has interwoven into his account of Edward ("Ned") Kern the parallel
                    lives of his brothers Benjamin and Richard. All three were caught up in a restless society whose
                    "fever was the result of a contagious Romanticism" (Preface, vii). The spectacular
                    beauty of the still-unexplored West mesmerized them. Its savagery almost extinguished them: brother
                    Benjamin was killed by the Utes in 1849; four years later Richard was cut down by the same people.</p>
            <p>The theme of this fine contribution to the <hi rend="i">Yale Western Americana Series</hi> is the way
                    in which the artist-scientist Ned Kern acted upon and, above all, was subject to America's
                    period of Manifest Destiny. While most of the research was done at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Huntington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Library, the author has tracked down manuscript material and Kern illustrations all

                    art history or the development of scientific study by Americans will surely wish to examine <hi rend="i">Edward Kern and American Expansion.</hi> The Kerns epitomized that fast-fading
                    generation which dared pry into every aspect of man's natural environment.</p>
            <p>Historians of the Pacific will want to read Chapters V and VI which deal with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Navy's North Pacific Exploring Expedition. That ambitious project, concurrent
                    with Perry's opening of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName> and stretching over a number of years, deserves greater attention than it has
                    heretofore received.</p>
            <p>Approximately a fourth of the book is devoted to index, bibliography, and appended illustrations.
                    There are thirty-six pages which sample Kern's paintings, sketches, and cartographical
                    notes. In addition, and quite as fascinating as Kern's illustrations of Zuni and Navajo
                    Indians, are the daguerreotypes of the Kern brothers. Unfortunately these latter are not dated and
                    one can only guess when the bearded, youthful faces were caught for posterity. Why there is no map
                    in a book which absolutely demands one is a mystery known only to the author and the publisher.</p>
            <p>This biographical study is filled with a variety of fresh information. For example the author notes
                    that the western paintings of the period which stand as noteworthy reflections of the Hudson River
                    School of landscape painting may in reality be more the creation of the eastern lithographers than trans-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> artists. Professor Hine recalls the significance of the guano craze in the
                    1850's when one of the primary tasks assigned the Navy was to search out likely quano
                    deposits whose powers were said to make a ship's mast sprout into leafy bowers. On occasion
                    the Pacific explorers armed themselves and demanded oriental cooperation in their scientific labors.
                    Such temerity will surprise only a few readers. Edward Kern's role embodies what was finest
                    and what was most sinister in the onrush of the occidental. Unfortunately the earnest desire to seek
                    out scientific truth never actually sublimated the Caucasian's overwhelming sense of
                    ethno-cultural superiority.</p>

            <p>Few men are as qualified by knowledge or experience to compile a Civil War anthology as is Professor
                    William B. Hesseltine of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, and <hi rend="i">The Tragic Conflict</hi> reflects commendably his ability to
                    spotlight and situate one era amid the complicated maze that is the American heritage.</p>
            <p>The anthology itself is both balanced and comprehensive. Hesseltine has first gleaned excerpts from
                    forty-five different sources and then grouped them under six major headings: Disunion, The Armies,
                    Emancipation and the Negro, The Confederate Effort, Political Developments, and The Economic Impact.
                    Like previous anthologists, he has utilized such works as Grant's <hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi>
                    and Edward Pollard's <hi rend="i">Southern History of the War.</hi> Unlike previous
                    compilers, Hesseltine has also dipped into such excellent but little-known memoirs as John Will
                    Dyer's Confederate <hi rend="i">Reminiscences</hi> and Whitelaw Reid's <hi rend="i">After the War.</hi> The excerpts are from such varied sources as General Jacob
                    Cox's <hi rend="i">Military Reminiscences</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Poems of Paul Hamilton
                        Hayne.</hi> Yet in that variety, by skillful selection and deft commentary, Hesseltine has woven
                    a unique history of the years 1850–1877 that is heterogeneous in foundation and
                    homogeneous in bringing "the tragic conflict" into perceptible focus.</p>
            <p>However, and relatively speaking, historians will pay small attention to the anthology. Rather, they
                    will carefully analyze—and possibly denigrate—the editor's
                    twenty-one-page introduction; for here Hesseltine has interpreted the whole Middle Period in a
                    manner that is revisionary or revolutionary, depending largely upon one's background and/or
                    leanings.</p>
            <p>"There was little in the America of 1880," he states, "that had not been
                    foreshadowed in 1850." Then, snipping at the heels of the "repressible"
                    historians, Hesseltine concludes: "Perhaps, indeed, the Civil War was a desperate effort
                    [by the South] to stave off the inevitable." From this kickoff point Hesseltine roars
                    through the field of historical interpretation with the calmness of a starving Apache chasing
                    buffalos. Few established groups escape a poke from the Hesseltine pen. To the idolaters of Lincoln
                    goes the following: "Lincoln's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> Address might have been delivered just as appropriately by Jefferson Davis, President
                    of the Confederate States of America." The nationalist school of historians comes in for a
                    blockbusting salvo. Throughout the Civil War, Hesseltine asserts, Lincoln, his "swollen
                    bureaucracy," and large business interests "battled against States'
                    Rights." In the end they not only destroyed the old Federal Union but, simultaneously,
                    "they destroyed one of the ancient bulwarks of human liberty—the power of the
                    states to protect the people."</p>
            <p>With the grass growing greener over Calhoun's grave because of the above statement,
                    Hesseltine then uncorks a powerhouse right on the Reconstruction school, especially that small
                    element of revisionists who see justification and godliness in the events of 1867–1876.
                    Reconstruction <pb n="383" id="VAA4025-058-4-109"/> was no reconstruction at all, Hesseltine states.
                    "It was in fact a new national construction," although it was highlighted for a
                    decade by "an era of unprecedented corruption" on the part of
                    "carpet-baggers, scalawags, and Radical Republicans." Hesseltine's
                    reference to "hate-mongering Radicals, intent upon destroying the South and prating about
                    freedom" hardly coincides with those modern writers who would have us accept the image of
                    "Lincoln and his loyal opposition."</p>
            <p>The whole introduction contains a multitude of sweeping generalizations. Many are true, some are
                    provocative, and several will no doubt invite long and loud rebuttals. This reviewer might agree
                    with Hesseltine's analysis of Robert E. Lee as "a supreme tactician sadly
                    deficient in concepts of strategy" if the axiom applied only to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> and not to Lee's conduct throughout the war. Yet the statement hardly has
                    validity in the case of Chancellorsville, where Lee's daring in tactics and strategy
                    reduced his capable opponent, Joseph Hooker, to a state of blubbering disconcertion.</p>
            <p>The book has one glaring weakness, which is not the fault of the editor. The publisher, displaying
                    rare shortsightedness in a volume of this size, omitted an index and thus restricted appreciably
                    both the value and the usefulness of the total study. Only a superior anthology could withstand so
                    painful a wound. This is such a work, presented in a stimulating fashion that has made the name
                    Hesseltine synonymous with academic excellence.</p>

            <p>A happy aspect of the Civil War centennial observance has been the republication of esteemed but
                    relatively obscure books such as Colonel Dawes' which otherwise would have remained
                    collectors' items not available to the ordinary buff or to students remote from large city
                    or university libraries. And—whatever may be said about the centennial jubilees and
                    battle reenactments—contributions to the literature of the war like Mr. Smith's
                    give lasting value to the observance. Often regimental histories yield fresher, more detailed
                    pictures than are found in biographies of the celebrated leaders or the more popularly read and
                    applauded general histories.</p>

                    </placeName>'s most cherished stories.</p>
            <p>Alan T. Nolan, historian of the <hi rend="i">Iron Brigade,</hi> of which this regiment was a part,
                    has not only given an enticing summary of the book in his Editor's Foreword, but has also
                    distinguished it among the vast number of regimental histories. The Sixth <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> was in the vortex of combat. With Colonel Dawes, the reader is on the firing line in
                    most of the eastern campaigns.</p>
            <p>Another characterizing feature of this book is the author's ability as soldier and writer.
                    He possessed objectivity, good power of observation, an understanding of people, and familiarity
                    with numerous other army units. Dawes was a noteworthy man of distinguished ancestry whose sons were
                    to include industrial leaders and a vice president. He wrote clearly, intimately, engagingly.</p>
            <p>The editor rightfully finds merit in the manner of presentation. The book is a combination of
                    immediate reactions and more seasoned judgments. Throughout are scattered letters, carefully
                    preserved by the colonel's wife, which give immediacy. Where error or hasty judgment
                    occurs, the editor's narrative supplies elucidation.</p>
            <p>A bit of Americana in the book which does not seem to have gained deserved notice in general war
                    histories relates to the visit of Julia Ward Howe to the Sixth near <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> early in the war. She returned with the regiment from the army review at
                    Bailey's Cross Roads and heard the lusty-lunged tenor, Sergeant John Ticknor, lead the
                    singing about Jeff Davis and the sour apple tree while dews and damps of evening were falling about.
                    That march, according to Dawes, inspired her to write "The Battle Hymn of the
                    Republic." Her own account of the writing does not conflict, but tends to confirm
                    Dawes' story, though she does not mention this particular regiment or Sergeant Ticknor.</p>
            <p>None interested in that bitterly fought war will make a mistake in reading and owning this splendid
                    story of an intrepid regiment.</p>

            <p>Perhaps its only peaceful assignment, and manifestly the greatest honor which came to it, was to be

            <p>The word "famous" may be associated with this regiment discriminatingly. It had its

                    shared in the deadly combat at the "mule shoe" salient at Spotsylvania, <pb n="385" id="VAA4025-058-4-111"/> and supplied the covering fire when the mine was exploded at
                    Petersburg.</p>
            <p>The book is remarkable because of the splendid research, careful annotation, and great mass of
                    detailed information accumulated by Mr. Smith, a self-made historian who has demonstrated that the
                    urgency to write sometimes is more important than an academic background.</p>
            <p>Of interest to Indiana buffs is his treatment of Solomon Meredith, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> colonel of the Nineteenth Indiana who became brigadier general and commander of the
                    "Iron Brigade" succeeding John Gibbon. Historians have taken delight in
                    downgrading Meredith partly because Gibbon, a West Point graduate and good soldier, opposed his
                    elevation but mainly because he was backed assiduously by Indiana's war governor, Oliver P.
                    Morton, and was deemed a politician-general. Smith assures the reader repeatedly of
                    Gibbon's opposition but is a bit more generous with Meredith than are some other
                    chroniclers.</p>
            <p>The prose, while at times lacking the elevation of a finished or professional writer, is free of the
                    ornateness which strains much Civil War writing; it reads easily and does not intrude itself above
                    the telling of the story. Though it could scarcely be rated distinguished, the book as a whole is a
                    creditable achievement which gives the regiment the visibility to which it is entitled. The maps are
                    unusually good for a regimental history.</p>

            <p>He concludes that, immediately after the Civil War, "the spirit of the South and the
                    principles underlying it were very much alive" (p. 53). This revival of the antebellum
                    spirit and the protests of Negro conventions against it contributed to the determination of Congress
                    to enforce its own plan of Reconstruction. Some northern states objected to granting Negroes the
                    right to vote, not only in the formerly seceded states but also in their own states. These actions
                    emboldened President Johnson to denounce Negro suffrage with new vigor in his message to <pb n="386" id="VAA4025-058-4-112"/> Congress in December, 1867. "Of all the dangers which our
                    nation has encountered," he warned, "none are equal to those which must result
                    from the success of the effort now making to Africanize the half of our country." Most of
                    the Negroes who were enfranchised by the Congressional Acts of 1867 did not possess the
                    qualifications to participate effectively in a democracy; but neither did large numbers of white
                    Americans enfranchised during the age of Jackson "or the large number of immigrants who
                    were being voted in herds by political bosses in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Negroes did not dominate any of the conventions. With the aid of the much maligned
                    "carpetbaggers" and "scalawags," able Negro leaders proposed new
                    constitutions which contained many worthwhile provisions, some of which are still in effect. After
                    the adoption of these constitutions and the election of the state legislatures, many white
                    Conservatives implored God to deliver the state "from the horrors of Negro
                    domination" (p. 129). But "they held their heavy fire until admission had been
                    achieved" (p. 130). Only in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> legislatures did Negroes exercise considerable influence and even in those two states
                    their influence was not in proportion to their population. Some of the Negro members of the state
                    legislatures and of Congress were able men. Graft, which was common in some parts of the North,
                    prevailed also in the South, but very few Negroes profited from "big graft" such
                    as that associated with the development of railroads.</p>
            <p>"Counter Reconstruction" began, as in the case of the organization of the Ku Klux
                    Klan, before the era of "Negro domination." One of Professor Franklin's
                    most important conclusions is his conviction that "reconstruction could have been
                    overthrown without the use of violence" (p. 172). He agrees with Holland
                    Thompson's assertion that the New South began with the fall of the Confederacy (p. 181).
                    But the panic of 1873 left the South in such an economic plight that, as C. Vann Woodward pointed
                    out in <hi rend="i">Reunion and Reaction,</hi> northern Republicans and Democrats used offers of
                    financial assistance as part of the lever which made Southerners agree to the election of Hayes. Few
                    historians will quarrel with Professor Franklin's final conclusion that after
                    Reconstruction "the Union had not made the achievements of the war a foundation for the
                    healthy advancement of the political, social and economic life of the <placeName>

                    titles to much of the land so exploited (a factor in the slow settlement which the author of <hi rend="i">Farms in the Cutover</hi> has omitted).</p>
            <p>Quickly following the lumber barons were the land speculators (both individual and corporate) and the
                    railroad agents, bent on enticing the immigrants to wresting an existence from the cutover lands.
                        <hi rend="i">Farms in the Cutover</hi> is an account of the settlement in 24 counties of

                    </placeName>, 1870–1925.</p>
            <p>From the viewpoint of the speculator there seemed every reason for success. The vanishing of prime
                    agricultural land in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> and the West by 1900, the population boom, and the anticipated back-to-the-farm
                    movement of World War I veterans all were factors which conjured visions of rapid land occupation.</p>
            <p>The author emphasizes the similarity in the process of land speculation in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> and other frontier areas. Similarities there were, but in one significant way the
                    colonizers of the cutover were unusually fortunate. Few speculators have had such consistent
                    long-term support from the local newspapers, county and state governments (though the latter was
                    erratic), and most intriguing of all from the Agricultural School of the University. Academic Dean

                    land publicist.</p>
            <p>Support on a promotional basis was an asset; a huge liability, which no speculator or academician
                    readily admitted, was poor land. In fact it was not until 1922 that a state commissioner of lands
                    publicly confessed that the cutover region was "mighty poor for farming" (p. 88).
                    Deficient soil would have been enough eventually to thwart agricultural utilization but other causes
                    of the land colonizers' failure were not hard to find. The forecasted flow of population
                    never materialized; the long-term credit base was never established; ethics of land agents,
                    charitably stated, left something to be desired; clearing of land became a costly problem; and
                    finally, the <hi rend="i">coup de grace</hi> was administered by the agricultural depression of the

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Farms in the Cutover</hi> is a thoroughly researched—testified by 60 pages of
                    notes and bibliography in a total of 184 pages—and carefully constructed work. Two
                    caveats suggest themselves: first, the style seems unnecessarily pedantic; second, many of the
                    individual promoters and corporate organizers remain shadowy figures, both as to personality and
                    operation. After making such observations it is traditional to the point of dogmatism to note that
                    the book under review is a contribution. With that judgment I have no quarrel; the profession is in
                    Helgeson's debt for a competent monograph.</p>

            <p>The current publication of an official history commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Church
                    of the Nazarenes is a welcome and <pb n="388" id="VAA4025-058-4-114"/> masterful addition to the
                    annals of church history in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Publication was authorized by the Board of General Superintendents through a Church
                    History Commission established in 1955. Realizing "the founding fathers were rapidly
                    passing away," they saw the need to collect and file in a central repository "the
                    many significant documents scattered in all parts of the nation, <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and the British Isles."</p>
            <p>Of special significance was the intent of the superintendents in sponsoring this publication. <hi rend="i">Called Unto Holiness</hi> aspires not only to present the historical facts of the
                    formative years of the Nazarenes. It seeks also to inform its membership of the reasons for the
                    founding of their church and the heritage of its tradition. The superintendents rightly judged, as
                    stated in the Preface by Mr. Hugh C. Benner, that "it takes but one generation, ignoring or
                    distorting the spirit and basic issues, to change for all the future the course of any spiritual
                    enterprise." Of equal importance was the wisdom of assigning such a task to a competent
                    historian, a man capable equally of understanding sympathetically the movement being portrayed and
                    of critical and penetrating analysis.</p>
            <p>The Church of the Nazarene is, as Professor Smith carefully brings to our attention, a Wesleyan
                    denomination. Its early leaders were Methodist ministers; its staunchest supporters were Methodist
                    laymen; its doctrines were Wesleyan. In its present organization, following the leadership crisis of
                    1916–1917, it continues the episcopal tradition of Methodism, albeit under different
                    terms and titles. The great issue which gave rise to the Nazarene movement lay in the interpretation
                    of the doctrine of sanctification. Wesley believed there remained in man after conversion an inner
                    tendency to evil—an individual inheritance of "original sin." This
                    doctrine was espoused by early Methodism. Gradually, however, Methodist theological thinking grew
                    away from the active expression of this concept. Those who persisted in its acceptance formed
                    "holiness" groups—prayer bands, camp meetings, and "Holiness
                    Associations." It was from a post-Civil War sense of spiritual awakening, which Professor
                    Smith has termed a "Holiness Revival," that the Church of the Nazarene evolved.</p>
            <p>The story of the Nazarenes is told smoothly and effectively. The accounts of the "Holiness
                    Revival" in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and the church question between 1880 and 1900, involving the dilemma of church loyalty
                    for the individual church member, are especially worthy. The treatment of the
                    "come-outers" during this period is of special merit. The evolution of
                    "holiness" thinking and action, as it led to the establishment of the Nazarenes as
                    a distinct group, is portrayed with great clarity. From its beginning in the East, through various
                    phases of inter-group affiliation, the movement is kept clearly defined in spite of complicated and
                    often ephemeral alignments. The deep feeling of divine inspiration is consistently maintained
                    without sacrificing candid analysis of conflicts and cross currents in polity and politics.</p>
            <p>One area of criticism might be offered. Although references are amply noted, there is no listed
                    bibliography. It would have been desirable to the student of church history if a selected
                    bibliography had been furnished precluding the necessity for laborious search of copious footnote
                    material in pursuit of sources. This does not deny, <pb n="389" id="VAA4025-058-4-115"/> however,
                    the merit of this publication both to the membership of the church and to the student of church
                    history.</p>
            <p>The story of "The Formative Years" ends with the epoch of the twenties. In
                    "A Forward Glance," appended to the last chapter of his work, Professor Smith
                    states that the story of the thirty years since the General Conference of 1933 would be "a
                    tempting one for us to try to tell." It is to be hoped that the admonition to
                    "yield not unto temptation" might be ignored in this instance.</p>

            <p>A review should be objective, impartial, analytical, accurate, and just in order to present to
                    prospective purchasers or readers a guarantee that the contents of a book either will or will not
                    suit their thousand differing tastes. I confess inability to write such a review of Rachel
                    Peden's <hi rend="i">Rural Free</hi> because I profess subjective kinship with every phase
                    and facet of Rachel Peden's calendar from page one, September, to the end of the following
                    August. I knew the land whereof she writes before mechanization, consolidation, concentration of
                    resources, and decentralization of community and family life became oppressive; before swift
                    facilities, utilities, and futilities had progressed to degenerative degrees. Mrs. Peden has
                    succeeded in integrating the old with the new without significant losses.</p>
            <p>It is paradoxical that Rachel Mason Peden—though not a dirt farm product—could
                    penetrate the confusion of modernization and accurately find, fix, and portray processes and mores
                    inflexibly retained throughout the Indiana portion of the Elizabethan Belt. It is remarkable that
                    she could also, without apparent strain, reconcile super-accurate reporting with earthy facts yet
                    never offend the most fastidious nor omit the truths of round-the-calendar farm living.</p>
            <p>The author has a rare genius for concealing herself modestly behind the tapestry she weaves, emerging
                    briefly with humor tart as wild grapes a week early: "If there is anything more irritating
                    than the sound of a person eating an apple, it's the sound of him trying to eat it
                    quietly" (p. 102); with a short sentence flatly stating a fact every farmer knows but not
                    one in a million ever thought to put in words: "Snow changes the colors of a
                    farmscape" (p. 142); and with tenderness that eludes analysis as in the exchange with her
                    dog, Rose, while walking in the June moonlight (p. 312).</p>
            <p>Consonant with the author's self-submersion in the interests of fine reporting is the
                    emergence of Dick Peden as a man, a husband, a farmer, a father—never one, never two,
                    never three but ever all, <pb n="390" id="VAA4025-058-4-116"/> and ever himself. By character, by
                    love of the land, by quiet wit and humor, and, most of all, by Rachel Peden's appreciative
                    understanding, he will linger in the minds of sensitive readers as the source-spring of a book too
                    long awaited.</p>
            <p>The things the author knows! For instance: it has been more than fifty years since my ears heard
                    "ewe" pronounced "yo" (p. 360); that is what all of us
                    turn-of-the-century Hoosiers called it.</p>
            <p>And "shafts": diligent search in the big dictionary will produce
                    "thills" as a syononym but it will not give the pronunciation required to make
                    sense in Indiana. In Indiana, shafts are "shavvs." Thills were unknown in my youth
                    but "shavvs" everyone knew. Buggies had "shavvs," and between
                    them the buggy horse was hitched. Romantically, the buggy periodically repopulated Indiana. Rachel
                    Peden knows this but does not make it obtrusive (p. 211).</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Rural Free</hi> has been crafted by a pro reporter. It is restrained and understating,
                    the better to give generations to come a heritage worth exploring. When my generation is gone,
                    readers of <hi rend="i">Rural Free</hi> can glean metaphorical artifacts further to illuminate a
                    Golden Age of Indiana's literary greatness.</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">Father and His Town</hi> Wilma Baker has deftly avoided maudlin sentimentality and
                    bathetic nostalgia, substituting therefor an honest picture of a typical town that refused to run
                    true-to-type. And, without false pride or false modesty, the author makes clear to her readers that
                    a unique personage caused the refusal.</p>
            <p>That the unique personage was her father and thus gave her superior opportunities for observing his
                    deeds cannot be denied; but, that her love and admiration caused her to exaggerate his importance to
                    the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Steubenville</settlement>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, is an untenable idea—the evidence of Dohrman James Sinclair's
                    influence is factual and enduring beyond question. And, without effusiveness, flag waving, or bible
                    thumping, the author manages to show her father preaching a powerful sermon on sane and decent
                    living by the rarest of all methods: precept and example.</p>
            <p>Perhaps without conscious intent, Mrs. Baker has analyzed present problems and evils by describing
                    the Good Old Days. She knew well that the Good Old Days were by no means all good: she neither
                    condemns nor falsely exalts them; she describes them accurately.</p>
            <p>And from the miasmas of metaphorical swamps of ignorance, now drained, emerge some perfumes that seem
                    to have been lost in the fumes of Progress: the code of living within one's means, the
                    pride of solving local problems locally, the pleasure of helping the needy or afflicted anonymously.</p>
            <p>Recently, we have been told from highest places that we should give generously to a mammoth charity
                    organization, and the reason stated was that increasing population had made it impracticable to
                    solve local aid problems locally! If I analyze correctly Mr. Sinclair's philosophy, such
                    high level dogma would have made the same amount of sense to him as saying that, whereas, the
                    hometown general practitioner with fifty years successful experience can set properly the broken leg
                    of a hometown boy stepped on by a small elephant, only <pb n="391" id="VAA4025-058-4-117"/> a high
                    priced doctor from wau is qualified to reduce a fracture caused by Jumbo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Father and His Town</hi> does not contain any stuffiness. There is ample humor but it is
                    never slapstick, cliché-tainted, nor pestilential. It leaves no sting and holds no
                    bitterness but, on the contrary, it lurks like a happy puppy and nips one gently, unawares. Chapter
                    8, "Eccentric People," is a delightful package and from it I cite a superb example
                    of finest dead pan: "The Baroness finally died, and poor Harry lived on for several years
                    in the Massillon Insane Asylum, which, while he wasn't actually insane, seemed a more
                    suitable place for him to end his days than in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Poorhouse" (p. 93).</p>
            <p>This book will make you respect the central figure and admire the expertise of the author who
                    projects a fine image vividly.</p>

                    Quirk. ([<placeName>

                    Pp. vi, 184. Notes, essay on sources, index. $5.00.)</head>
            <p>Beginning with an apt title and ending with a refreshing essay on sources, Professor Quirk's
                    latest book is delightful to read. Furthermore it is a well-documented and interpretive historical
                    account of a curious chapter in Mexican-American relations.</p>
            <p>President Wilson's Mexican policy was both quixotic and enigmatic. His idealism led him to
                    oppose armed intervention, yet he ordered occupation troops into Latin American nations more
                    frequently than any other American president. And although Wilson, a former political science
                    professor, would recognize only moral governments where the leaders ruled with the consent of the
                    governed, he recognized Carranza, who gained power through revolution and held no elections at the
                    time of his recognition. Quirk portrays Wilson and his secretary of state, William Jennings Bryan,
                    as self-righteous, ignorant of foreign affairs, and distrustful of the career diplomats in the
                    foreign service. Such a situation in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> partially explains why a small incident in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mx">Mexico</region>
                    </placeName> became a <hi rend="i">casus belli</hi> and led to the occupation of Veracruz by 7,000 <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> soldiers and marines.</p>
            <p>The incident at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tampico</settlement>
                    </placeName> in April, 1914, where American sailors were briefly jailed then released after an
                    apology by the Mexican commander, is well detailed in this book. Admiral Mayo, who subsequently
                    demanded that the Mexicans fire a twenty-one gun salute to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> flag, fares better here than in other accounts, in one of which he is relegated to the
                    "age of Santa Anna and the Prince de Joinville." Quirk gives us fresh insight into
                    the character of the American chargé d'affaires in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mx">Mexico</region>
                    </placeName> City, Nelson J. O'Shaughnessy, who saw in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tampico</settlement>
                    </placeName> affair a chance to improve his position in the diplomatic corps. Effective use of the
                    O'Shaughnessy papers, Department of State records, contemporary newspapers, and personal
                        <pb n="392" id="VAA4025-058-4-118"/> interviews enabled the author to unravel the maze of
                    diplomatic maneuvering following the military ultimatum.</p>
            <p>When diplomacy failed, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> resorted to armed force. The two chapters on the invasion and occupation of Veracruz
                    are a neat synthesis of a great amount of detailed information concerning military operations,
                    health measures, and legal, financial, and administrative problems. The United State forces were
                    evacuated some seven months after their entry into the Mexican port. Quirk's evaluation of
                    the occupation is summed up in one sentence, "Within a few weeks it was difficult to tell
                    that the Americans had ever occupied the city" (p. 171). He also points out that they left
                    without having received the controversial flag salute, nor did the occupation achieve its purpose of
                    preventing arms shipments to the unrecognized government of Huerta. Like the later abortive Pershing
                    expedition, this invasion of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mx">Mexico</region>
                    </placeName> was generally unsuccessful in achieving its goals, and it created a great deal of ill
                    will in Latin America.</p>
            <p>It is not difficult to see why the manuscript of this book earned Dr. Quirk the <geogName>Mississippi
                        Valley</geogName> Historical Association's Prize Studies Award in 1961. The narrative
                    is extremely clear, forceful, and well related to the larger scene of the Mexican Revolution and
                    Wilson's foreign policy. It will be enjoyed by the layman as well as the specialist.</p>
