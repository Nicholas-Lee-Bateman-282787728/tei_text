						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-2">W<hi rend="sc">e</hi> leave the highway here a little space -- </l>
							<l>(So much of life is near so much of death:)</l>
							<l>The chimney of a dwelling still is seen,</l>
							<l>A little mound of ruin, overgrown</l>
							<l>With lithe, long grasses and domestic weeds,</l>
							<l>Among the apple-trees (the ancestors</l>
							<l>Of yonder orchard fruited from their boughs)-</l>
							<l>The apple-trees that, when the place was rough</l>
							<l>With the wild forests, and the land was new,</l>
							<l>He planted: one, departed long ago,</l>
							<l>But still a presence unforgotten here,</l>
							<l>Who bless'd me in my boyhood, with his hands</l>
							<l>That seem'd like one's anointed. Gentle, strong,</l>
							<l>And warm'd with sunny goodness, warming all,</l>
							<l>Was he, familiar by the reverend name</l>
							<l>Of Uncle Gardner in our neighborhood:</l>
							<l>His love had grown to common property</l>
							<l>By ties that Nature draws from man to man,</l>
							<l>And so at last had claim'd the bond of blood.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9492-010" n="10"/>

						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-2">He was an elder in the land, and held</l>
							<l>His first proprietary right, it seem'd,</l>
							<l>From Nature's self; for, in an earlier day,</l>
							<l>He came with others, who of old had reach'd</l>
							<l>Their neighbor hands across New England farms,</l>
							<l>Over the mountains to this Western Land--</l>
							<l>A journey long and slow and perilous,</l>
							<l>With many hardships and the homesick look</l>
							<l>Of wife and children backward; chose his farm,</l>
							<l>Builded his house, and clear'd, by hard degrees,</l>
							<l>Acres that years ago were meadows broad,</l>
							<l>Or wheat-fields rocking in the summer heat.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-2">His children grew, and son and daughter pass'd</l>
							<l>Into the world that grew around, and some</l>
							<l>Into that world which evermore unseen</l>
							<l>Is still about us, and the graveyard where</l>
							<l>Their bodies slept (a few half sinking stones,</l>
							<l>A stranger's eyes would hardly see them, show</l>
							<l>Seventy rods yonder in the higher ground)</l>
							<l>Gave still a tenderer title, year by year,</l>
							<l>To the dear places earn'd by earlier toil.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-2">Meanwhile the years that made these woody vales</l>
							<l>An .eager commonwealth of crowding men</l>

							<pb id="VAA9492-011" n="11"/>

							<l>Pass'd, one by one, and every thing was changed;</l>
							<l>And he, whose limbs were like the hickory's when</l>
							<l>He'came with life's wrought vigor here, was changed:</l>
							<l>He heard the voice that tells men they are old.</l>
							<l>Yet not the less he moved his usual rounds,</l>
							<l>Walk'd his old paths; not idle, sweated still</l>
							<l>With scythe or sickle in the hay or wheat;</l>
							<l>Follow'd his plow when in the April sun</l>
							<l>The blackbird chatter'd after and the crow</l>
							<l>Far-off look'd anxious for the new-dropp'd corn;</l>
							<l>And gave the winter hours their services,</l>
							<l>With sheep abroad on slopes that, slanting south,</l>
							<l>Breathe off the snow and show a warming green,</l>
							<l>With cattle penn'd at home or bounding flail:</l>
							<l>So, not forgetting social offices</l>
							<l>Throughout all seasons, (gaining so the love</l>
							<l>That went acknowledged in his common name,)</l>
							<l>He, like the Servant in the Parable,</l>
							<l>Doing his duty, waited for his Lord.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-2">The chimney shows enough for memory,</l>
							<l>And, it may be, a stranger passing close,</l>
							<l>If thoughtful, well might think a tender thought</l>
							<l>Of vanish'd fireside faces, in his dream</l>
							<l>Suddenly lighted by a vanish'd fire.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9492-012" n="12"/>

							<l>And should the apple-trees that linger, loth</l>
							<l>To end their blossoming, attract his eye,</l>
							<l>Their fragrance would not pass unrecognized</l>
							<l>For deeper gifts than fragrance. He is gone</l>
							<l>Who planted them, and thirty years are gone.</l>
							<l>Now, if you look a quarter-mile away,</l>
							<l>Beyond the toll-gate and its lifted sweep,</l>
							<l>You see a prouder house-not new nor old--</l>
							<l>Beneath whose later roof no spirit dwells</l>
							<l>That had its tenure here: a stranger holds</l>
							<l>The secondary ownership of law.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-2">It is a story, common though it seem,</l>
							<l>Tender and having pathos for the heart</l>
							<l>Which knows, but will not know, that he who says</l>
							<l>"My own," and looks to-day on willing fields,</l>
							<l>And sets his family tree in trusted ground,</l>
							<l>To-morrow hears another answer "Mine."</l>
							<l>Listen, if you will listen. It is hard</l>
							<l>To go an alien from familiar doors</l>
							<l>When we are young, to wrestle where we go,</l>
							<l>And win or lose exulting-we are strong;</l>
							<l>But it is pitiful when weak and old,</l>
							<l>When only for the near in life we seek,</l>



							<pb id="VAA9492-013" n="13"/>





							<l>And heaven, yearn'd after, is not thought of far,</l>
							<l>To lose our shelter and to want for rest.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-2">Of Uncle Gardner's children three were dead--</l>
							<l>Yonder they lie. Their mother and two with him</l>
							<l>(Two youngest: one a boy of fourteen years,</l>
							<l>His latest child-a girl three years beyond)</l>
							<l>Breathed in his close, contented atmosphere;</l>
							<l>An elder daughter, wedded years before,</l>
							<l>Lived far away in watery Michigan;</l>
							<l>His eldest son-and the first-born of all-</l>
							<l>Thrived as a merchant in the city near,</l>
							<l>Had thriven, at least, or so 'twas said, and he</l>
							<l>For some keen chance had got the old man's will</l>
							<l>To be his bond. The father pledged the land-</l>
							<l>Willing for the grown man, yet for the boy</l>
							<l>And for his girl at home regretfully,</l>
							<l>Deeming the chance a rash one. From that day</l>
							<l>He wrought his daily labors ill-content,</l>
							<l>And with a trouble in his countenance,</l>
							<l>That would not put a false face on his heart.</l>
							<l>To things familiar came a subtle change.</l>
							<l>The brook that long ago, companion-like,</l>
							<l>Had grown acquainted with his solitude,</l>
							<l>And, later, made him music when he walk'd</l>
						</lg>



						<pb id="VAA9492-014" n="14"/>





						<lg>
							<l>And led his children through the pasture-ground</l>
							<l>Up to the haying or the harvest-gap,</l>
							<l>A noisy mimic of their prattled words,</l>
							<l>Now seem'd to lift a stranger's face at him,</l>
							<l>Wondering why he came there, who he was,</l>
							<l>Or murmur'd, with a long and low lament,</l>
							<l>Some undercurrent of an exile's song</l>
							<l>That is not on his lips but in his heart.</l>
							<l>Nothing was as it had been: something vague,</l>
							<l>That Present of the Future which is born</l>
							<l>Within the bosom, whispering what will be,</l>
							<l>Met him and follow'd him, and would not cease</l>
							<l>To meet and follow him: it seem'd to say</l>
							<l>"The place that knew you shall know you no more."</l>
							<l>And oftentimes he saw the highway stirr'd</l>
							<l>With slowly-journeying dust, and, passing slow,</l>
							<l>The many who forever in our land</l>
							<l>Were going farther, driven by goads unseen,</l>
							<l>Or not content and looking for the new;</l>
							<l>And then he thought of how in those dear days</l>
							<l>He, too, had ventured, and again he saw</l>
							<l>With steadfast eyes forgotten faces, known</l>
							<l>When he was young, and others dear to him</l>
							<l>From whom he parted with regret but firm</l>
							<l>In the strong purposes which build the world;</l>

							<pb id="VAA9492-015" n="15"/>





							<l>Thought of his consolation-she most dear</l>
							<l>Was with him, they most helpless with him, too,</l>
							<l>For whom he sought a newer world of hope:</l>
							<l>"But I am old," he murmur'd, "she is old,"</l>
							<l>And saw his hand was shaken like his thought,</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-2">Such were his troubled fancies. When he slept,</l>
							<l>In his slow dreams-with lagging team, the last</l>
							<l>Of many that in yonder meadows foal'd</l>
							<l>Grew ard became a portion of the place-</l>
							<l>Journeying far away, and never more</l>
							<l>Reaching his journey's goal, (a weary road</l>
							<l>Whose end came only with the waking day.)</l>
							<l>He seem'd to pass, and always 'twas the same:</l>
							<l>Through new-built villages of joyous homes,</l>
							<l>Homes not for him, by openings recent-made,</l>
							<l>But not for him, by cultivated farms</l>
							<l>Of other men-and always 'twas the same.</l>
							<l>Then, when he woke and found the dream a dream,</l>
							<l>And through his window shone the sun and brought</l>
							<l>The faint rich smell of the new-tassel'd corn,</l>
							<l>More fragrant from the dew that weigh'd it down,</l>
							<l>He murmur'd of his fields--" For other men;</l>
							<l>They are not mine. The mortgage will be closed;</l>
							<l>The mortgage goes wherever I shall go."</l>
						</lg>



						<pb id="VAA9492-016" n="16"/>






						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-2">So pass'd the quarter of a year, and so</l>
							<l>The old man, burden'd with his little world,</l>
							<l>Felt it upon his shoulders, stooping down,</l>
							<l>Bent more with this than every other year.</l>
							<l>And summer pass'd to autumn: in his door</l>
							<l>He sat and saw the leaves, his friends of old,</l>
							<l>Audible in the sunshine, falling, falling,</l>
							<l>With a continuous rustle-music fit</l>
							<l>For his accompanying thought. At last it came,</l>
							<l>The blow that reach'd his heart before it came,</l>
							<l>For all was lost: the son whose risk he placed</l>
							<l>Both on his children's home and on his heart</l>
							<l>Was ruin'd, as the careless worldlings say--</l>
							<l>Ruin'd indeed, it seem'd, for on his brain</l>
							<l>The quick stroke flash'd: for many years the son</l>
							<l>Breathed in a world in which he did not live.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-2">The old man took the blow but did not fall--</l>
							<l>Its weight had been before. The land was sold,</l>
							<l>The mortgage closed. That winter, cold and long,</l>
							<l>(Permitted by the hand that grasp'd his all</l>
							<l>That winter pass'd he here,) beside his fire,</l>
							<l>He talk'd of moving in the spring, he talk'd</l>
							<l>(While- the shrill sap cried in a troubled blaze)</l>
							<l>Like one whose life was not all broken down,</l>


							<pb id="VAA9492-017" n="17"/>



							<l>Cheerfully garrulous, with words that show</l>
							<l>False witnesses of hope and seeming strength</l>
							<l>When these are gone and come not. In the spring,</l>
							<l>When the first warmth had brooded every-where,</l>
							<l>He sat beside his doorway in that warmth,</l>
							<l>Watching the wagons on the highway pass,</l>
							<l>With something of the memory of his dread</l>
							<l>In the last autumn; and he fell asleep.</l>
							<l>Perhaps within his sleep he seem'd again</l>
							<l>Journeying far away for evermore,</l>
							<l>Leaving behind the homes of other men,</l>
							<l>Seeking a newer home for those he loved,</l>
							<l>A pioneer again. And so he slept--</l>
						</lg>

						<l rend="ti-2">And still he sleeps: his grave is one of those.</l>

						<l rend="ti-2">His wife soon joined his sleep beside him there.</l>

						<l rend="ti-2">Their children Time has taken and the world.</l>

						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-2">The chimney shows enough for memory,</l>
							<l>The graves remain; all other trace is gone,</l>
							<l>Except the apple-trees that linger, loth</l>
							<l>To end their blossoming. In restless moods</l>
							<l>I used to wander hither oftentimes,</l>


							<pb id="VAA9492-018" n="18"/>



							<l>And often linger'd till the twilight came,</l>
							<l>Touch'd with the melancholy breathed by change;</l>
							<l>And something in the atmosphere, I thought,</l>
							<l>Remain'd of hours and faces that had been.</l>
							<l>Then, thinking of the Past and all I knew</l>
							<l>And all remember'd of it-most of him</l>
							<l>Whose vanish'd fireside blazed so near me here--</l>
							<l>My fancy, half unconscious, shaped the things</l>
							<l>Which had been, and among the quiet trees</l>
							<l>The chimney from its burial mound arose;</l>
							<l>The ruin'd farm-house grew a quiet ghost--</l>
							<l>Its walls were thrill'd with murmur-music, humm'd</l>
							<l>By inner voices scarcely heard without;</l>
							<l>And from the window breathed a vaporous light</l>
							<l>Into the outer mist of vernal dark,</l>
							<l>And lo! a crowd of sparks against the sky</l>
							<l>Sprang suddenly, at times, and from the wood</l>
							<l>(The wood?-no wood was here for forty years!)</l>
							<l>Bark'd the shrill fox and all the stars hung bright.</l>
							<l>Till, busy with the silence far away,</l>
							<l>(And whether heard or heard not hardly known,)</l>
							<l>First indistinct, then louder, nearer still,</l>
							<l>And ever louder, grew a tremulous roar;</l>
							<l>Then, sudden, flared a torch from out the night,</l>
							<l>And, eastward half-a-mile, the shimmering train</l>





							<pb id="VAA9492-019" n="19"/>





							<l>Hurried across the darkness and the dream,</l>
							<l>And all my fantasy was gone, at once--</l>
							<l>The lighted window and the fireside sound:</l>
							<l>I saw the heap of ruin underfoot,</l>
							<l>And overhead the leaves were jarr'd awake,</l>
							<l>Whispering a moment of the flying fright,</l>
							<l>And far away the whistle, like a cry,</l>
							<l>Shrill in the darkness reach'd the waiting town.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> bees in the clover are making honey, and I am making my
								hay:</l>
							<l>The air is fresh, I seem to draw a young man's breath to-day.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>The bees and I are alone in the grass: the air is so very still</l>
							<l>I hear the dam, so loud, that shines. beyond the sullen mill.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Yes, the air is so still that I hear almost the sounds I can not hear--</l>
							<l>That, when no other sound is plain, ring in my empty ear:</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>The chime of striking scythes, the fall of the heavy swaths they sweep--</l>



							<pb id="VAA9492-022" n="22"/>





							<l>They ring about me, resting, when I waver half asleep;</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>So still I am not sure if a cloud, low down, unseen there be,</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Or if something brings a rumor home of the cannon so far from me:</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Far away in Virginia where Joseph and Grant, I know,</l>
							<l>Will tell them, what I meant when first I had my mowers go!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Joseph he is my eldest one, the only boy of my three</l>
							<l>Whose shadow can darken my door again, and lighten my heart for me.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Joseph he is my eldest--how his scythe was striking ahead!</l>
							<l>William was better at shorter heats, but Jo in the long-run led.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>William he was my youngest; John, between them, I somehow see,</l>
							<l>When my eyes are shut, with a little board at his head in Tennessee.</l>
						</lg>


						<pb id="VAA9492-023" n="23"/>






						<lg>
							<l>But William came home one morning early, from Gettysburg, last July</l>
							<l>(The mowing was over already, although the only mower was I:)</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>William, my captain, came home for good to his mother; and I'll be bound</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>We were proud and cried to see the flag that wrapt his coffin around;</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>For a company from the town came up ten miles with music and gun:</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>It seem'd his country claim'd him then-as well as his mother-her son.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>But Joseph is yonder with Grant to-day, a thousand miles or near,</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>And only the bees are abroad at work with me in the clover here.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Was it a murmur of thunder I heard that humm'd again in the air?</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Yet, may be, the cannon are sounding now their Onward to Richmond there.</l>
						</lg>



						<pb id="VAA9492-024" n="24"/>






						<lg>
							<l>But under the beech by the orchard, at noon, I sat an hour it would seem--</l>
							<l>It may be I slept a minute, too, or waver'd into a dream.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>For I saw my boys, across the field, by the flashes as they went,</l>
							<l>Tramping a steady tramp as of old with the strength in their arms unspent;</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Tramping a steady tramp, they moved, like soldiers that march to the beat</l>
							<l>Of music that seems, a part of themselves, to rise and fall with their feet;</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Tramping a steady tramp, they came with flashes of silver that shone,</l>
							<l>Every step, from their scythes that rang as if they needed the stone--</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>(The field is wide and heavy with grass)-and, coming toward me they beam'd</l>
							<l>With a shine of light in their faces at once, and-- surely I must have dream'd</l>
						</lg>



						<pb id="VAA9492-025" n="25"/>






						<lg>
							<l>For I sat alone in the clover-field, the bees were working ahead.</l>
							<l>There were three in my vision-remember, old man: and what if Joseph were dead!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>But I hope that he and Grant (the flag above them both, to boot,)</l>
							<l>Will go into Richmond together, no matter whioh is ahead or afoot!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Meantime alone at the mowing here-an old man somewhat gray--</l>
							<l>I must stay at home as long as I can, making myself the hay.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And so another round-the quail in the orchard whistles blithe--</l>
							<l>But first I'll drink at the spring below, and whet again my scythe.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>A<hi rend="sc">FTER</hi> Winter fires were ended, and the last spark, vanishing</l>
							<l>From the embers on our hearthstone, flew into the sky of spring:</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>In the night-time, in the morning-when the air was hush'd around--</l>
							<l>Throbbing vaguely on the silence, came a dull, mysterious sound:</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Like the sultry hum of thunder, at the sullen close of day,</l>
							<l>Out of clouds that brood and threaten on the horizon far away.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"'Tis," I said, "the April thunder," and I thought of flowers that spring,</l>
							<l>And of trees that stand in blossom, and of birds that fly and sing.</l>
						</lg>


						<pb id="VAA9492-029" n="29"/>





						<lg>
							<l>But the sound, repeated often-nearer, more familiar grown--</l>
							<l>From our chimney seem'd descending, and the swallow's wings were known.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Where the lithe flames leap'd and lighten'd, charm of host and cheer of guest,</l>
							<l>There the emigrant of Summer chose its homestead, built its nest.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then I dream'd of poets dwelling, like the swallow, long ago,</l>
							<l>Overhead in dusky places ere their songs were heard below;</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Overhead in humble attics, ministers of higher things:</l>
							<l>Underneath were busy people, overhead were heavenly wings!</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>And I thought of homely proverbs that on simple lips had birth,</l>
							<l>Born of gentle superstitions at old firesides of the earth:</l>
						</lg>



						<pb id="VAA9492-030" n="30"/>





						<lg>
							<l>How, where'er the swallow builded under human roofs its nest,</l>
							<l>Something holier, purer, higher, in the house became a guest;</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Peace, or Love, or Health, or Fortune--something Prosperous, from the air</l>
							<l>'Lighting with the wings of swallows, breathed divine possession there.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>"Friendly gods," I said, "descending, make their gentler visits so,</l>
							<l>Fill the air with benedictions-songs above and songs below!"</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Then I murmur'd, "Welcome, swallow; I, your land- lord, stand content:</l>

							<l>How bright this wierd autumnal eve--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">While the wild twilight clings around,</l>
							<l>Clothing the grasses every-where,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">With scarce a dream of sound!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The high horizon's northern line,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">With many a silent-leaping spire,</l>
							<l>Seems a dark shore--a sea of flame--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Quick, crawling waves of fire!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I stand in dusky solitude,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">October breathing low and chill,</l>
							<l>And watch the far-off blaze that leaps</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">At the wind's wayward will.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>These boundless fields, behold, once more,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Sea-like in vanish'd summers stir;</l>
							<l>From vanish'd autumns comes the Fire--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">A lone, bright harvester!</l>

						<lg>
							<l>I see wide terror lit before--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Wild steeds, fierce herds of bison here,</l>
							<l>And, blown before the flying flame,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The flying-footed deer!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Long trains (with shaken bells, that moved</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Along red twilights sinking slow)</l>
							<l>Whose wheels grew weary on their way,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Far westward, long ago;</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Lone wagons bivouack'd in the blaze,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">That, long ago, stream'd wildly past;</l>
							<l>Faces from that bright solitude</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">In the hot gleam aghast!</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>A glare of faces like a dream,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">No history after or before,</l>
							<l>Inside the horizon with the flames,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The flames--nobody more!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>That vision vanishes in me,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Sudden and swift and fierce and bright;</l>
							<l>Another gentler vision fills</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The solitude, to-night:</l>

							<l>The horizon lightens every-where,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The sunshine rocks on windy maize;</l>
							<l>Hark, every-where are busy men,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And children at their plays!</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Far church-spires twinkle at the sun,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">From villages of quiet born,</l>
							<l>And, far and near, and every-where,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Homes stand amid the corn.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>No longer driven by wind, the Fire</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Makes all the vast horizon glow,</l>
							<l>But, numberless as the stars above,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The windows shine below!</l>

						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Never more the friendly windows, red with warmth and Christian light,</l>
							<l>Breathe the traveler's benediction to his brethren in the night.</l>

							<l>Standing high in air deserted, ghost-like long itself has grown.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>Not a pane in any window-many a ragged corner- bit:</l>
							<l>Boys, the strolling exorcisors, gave the ghost their notice--" Quit."</l>

							<l>Through the roof the drear Novembers trickle down the midnight slow;</l>
							<l>In the Summer's warping sunshine green with moss the shingles grow.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Yet in Maying wind the locust, sifting sunny blossom, snows,</l>
							<l>And the rose-vine still remembers some dear face that loved the rose:</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Climbing up a Southern casement, looking in neglected air;</l>
							<l>And, in golden honey-weather, careful bees are humming there.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>In the frozen moon at midnight some have heard, when all was still--</l>
							<l>Nothing, I know! A ghostly silence keeps the tavern on the hill!</l>

							<l>I dream'd thee lost in yonder barren town,</l>

							<l>I have heard your panting heart,</l>

							<l>For the elusive flower of air.</l>

							<l>Dropping all their pretty dust</l>
							<l>At the touch of the sweet trust:</l>
							<l>Words of warm simplicity,</l>
							<l>Fusing cold philosophy,</l>
							<l>These would light your lips and brow--</l>
							<l>You would chase them anyhow!</l>
							<l>Chase them, fleet-foot champion,</l>
							<l>Lithe knight-errant of the sun!</l>
							<l>Chase the sultry butterflies,</l>
							<l>Tropic summers in disguise!</l>
							<l>Chase them, while your buoyant feet</l>
							<l>Take the heart's ecstatic beat,</l>
							<l>While your playmate is the breeze,</l>
							<l>While the flowers will hide the bees,</l>
							<l>While the birds come singing to you,</l>
							<l>While the sunshine gladdens through you!</l>
							<l>Butterflies, if caught or not,</l>
							<l>Thorough many a gentle spot</l>
							<l>They will lead-though vain the chase</l>
							<l>It must be in the heaven's face:</l>
							<pb id="VAA9492-065" n="65"/>
							<l>For they fly among the flowers,</l>
							<l>In bright air, through sunny hours.</l>

							<l>And, strange!--how strange it seem'd, indeed!</l>
							<l>Behold, the wondrous-mettled steed</l>

							<l>And thinks him flying-from the flies!"</l>
						</lg>

							<l>Till--at the last, when, weary grown;</l>
							<l>The crowd disperse and leave them there</l>
							<l>Unbought within the mart alone-</l>
							<l>Awaken'd into buoyant air</l>
							<l>From something like a dream of fame,</l>
							<l>A poet sees the sultry gleam</l>

							<l>W<hi rend="sc">AILS</hi> of slow music move along the street,</l>
							<l>Before the slow march of a myriad feet</l>
							<l rend="ti-5">Whose mournful echoes come;</l>
							<l>Banners are muffled, hiding all their sight</l>
							<l>Of sacred stars--the century's dearest light--</l>
							<l rend="ti-5">And, muffled, throbs the drum.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Proud is the hearse our Mother gives her son,</l>
							<l>On the red altar laid her earliest one!</l>
							<l rend="ti-5">Wrapp'd in her holiest pall</l>
							<l>He goes: her household guardians follow him;</l>
							<l>Eyes with their new heroic tears are dim;</l>
							<l rend="ti-5">The stern to-morrows call!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Well might the youth who saw his coffin'd face,</l>
							<l>Lying in state within the proudest place,</l>
							<l rend="ti-5">Long for a lot so high:</l>
							<l>He was the first to leap the treacherous wall;</l>
							<l>First in the arms of Death and Fame to fall--</l>
							<l rend="ti-5">To live because to die!</l>

							<l>Pass on, with wails of music, moving slow,</l>
							<l>Thy dark dead-march, O Mother dress'd in woe!</l>
							<l rend="ti-5">Lo, many another way</l>
							<l>Shall blacken after, many a sacred head</l>
							<l>Brightly thy stars shall fold, alive though dead,</l>
							<l rend="ti-5">From many a funeral day!</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Weep, but grow stronger in thy suffering:</l>
							<l>From their dead brothers' graves thy sons shall bring</l>
							<l rend="ti-5">New life of love for thee:</l>
							<l>The long death-marches herald, slow or fast,</l>
							<l>The resurrection-hour of men at last</l>

						<lg>
							<l>M<hi rend="sc">Y</hi> folded flower last Summer grew</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Sweetly in a glad Southern place;</l>
							<l>Its heart was filled with peaceful dew,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The peaceful sunshine kiss'd its face.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Beside the threshold of a cot</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">It knew familiar household ties,</l>
							<l>The May's beloved forget-me-not</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">To maiden's lips and children's eyes.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Bees climb'd about it; birds above</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Sang in the flush'd year of the rose:</l>
							<l>"Our new millennium of Love</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Begins with every May it blows."</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Warm cottage-windows murmur'd near</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">All music making home so sweet--</l>
							<l>The mother's voice divinely dear,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The lisping tongues, the pattering feet.</l>
						</lg>



						<pb id="VAA9492-116" n="116"/>






						<lg>
							<l>Ah, little rose, another tale</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">On your dumb lips has waited long</l>
							<l>(Since then your tender lips grew pale)--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Speak, darling; make your speech my song!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Another tale than cottage peace,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Than balmy quiet, hovering wings</l>
							<l>Of humming-birds and honey-bees,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And Summer's breath of shining things.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Ah, little rose, your lips are mute:</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Could Fancy give them words to-day,</l>
							<l>Such histories would but sadly suit</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Those lips that knew but Love and May!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>You woke, one Sabbath, warm and sweet:</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The fields' were bright with dewy glow;</l>
							<l>The sun smiled o'er the springing wheat,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And spake, "Let all things lovelier grow!"</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>What answer rock'd the awaken'd earth,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Strange echo to that voice divine!</l>
							<l>Before the battle's awful birth</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The earth and heaven gave no sign.</l>
						</lg>



						<pb id="VAA9492-117" n="117"/>





						<lg>
							<l>The cannon thunder'd every-where;</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The bomb sprang howling from afar,</l>
							<l>A coming earthquake born in air,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">A winged hell, a bursting star!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And lo! about the sacred spot</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Where late the doves of home would 'light.</l>
							<l>Men red with battle falter'd not</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Though others lay with faces white.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The lowly roof of Love, behold!</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Is rent by shell and cannon-ball;</l>
							<l>The rifles flame from casements old;</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">By bullets torn the roses fall!</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Under the rose-tree where you grew,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">A soldier, dying, look'd and saw</l>
							<l>Your face, that only Sabbath knew,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">With Nature's love and Heaven's law.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He heard with ebbing blood and breath,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">At your sweet charm, the thunder cease,</l>
							<l>And in that earthquake-hour of Death</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The cannon jarr'd the bells of Peace.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>For while he saw you, tender flower!</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">So peaceful in that troubled place,</l>
							<l>A tenderer vision touch'd the hour</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And left its halo on his face.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>A captain pluck'd you, in the roar</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Of battle, o'er his comrade slain,</l>
							<l>And through the fight your beauty bore</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Bloodless upon the bloody plain.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Dear rose, within your folded leaves</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">I know what other memory lies;</l>
							<l>I hear (or else my ear deceives)</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Your wail of homesick longing rise</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"O happy Summer, lost to me!</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">O threshold, mine to guard no more!"</l>
							<l>You yearn for visits of the bee</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">To rose's heart and cottage-door.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Rest in my book, O precious flower!</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And seem--a whitening face above--</l>
							<l>The witness in the battle hour</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Of Peace and Home, of God and Love!</l>

						<lg>
							<l>W<hi rend="sc">E</hi> start from sleep in morning's buoyant dawn,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And find the horror which our sleep oppress'd</l>
							<l>A vanish'd darkness, in the daylight gone--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The nightmare's burthen leaves the stifled breast.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Yet still a presence moves about the brain,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Some frightful shadow lost in hazy light,</l>
							<l>And in the noonday highway comes again.</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The loathsome phantom of the breathless night.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>So, while before these hateful doors I stand,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">I feel the burdening darkness which is pass'd,</l>
							<l>Or passing surely from the awaken'd land:</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The nightmare clutches me and holds me fast.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Back from the years that seem so long ago</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Return the dark processions which have been;</l>
							<l>Lifting again lost manacles of woe.</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">They enter here--they vanish, going in.</l>
						</lg>


						<pb id="VAA9492-120" n="120"/>





						<lg>
							<l>Hark to the smother'd murmur of a race</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Within these walls-its helpless wail and moan-</l>
							<l>Which, for the ancient shadow on its face,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Call'd not the morning's new-born light its own!</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>Imprison'd here, what unforgotten cries</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Of hopeless torture and what sights of woe,</l>
							<l>From cotton-field and rice-plantation rise!--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">These walls have heard, and seen, and witness show.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>The human drove, the human driver, see!</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Hark, the dread bloodhound in the swamp at bay!</l>
							<l>The whipping-post reēchoes agony;</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The slave-mart blackens all the shameful day.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>The wife and husband, see, asunder thrust;</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The mother dragg'd from her far children's wail;</l>
							<l>The maiden torn from love and given to lust--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The Human Family in a bill of sale!</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>All sound reecho, all sights reiippear:</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">(O blindness, deafness! that ye can not be!)</l>
							<l>All sounds of woe, that have been heard, I hear;</l>

						<lg>
							<l>O sounds, be still! O visions, leave the day!--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">What thunder trembled on the sultry air?</l>
							<l>What lightnings went upon their breathless way?'</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Behold the stricken gates of old despair!</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>The writing on these barbarous walls was plain;</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The curse has fallen none would understand:</l>
							<l>God's deluge ere another happier rain;</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">His plow of fire before the reaper's land!</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>The awful nightmare slips into its night,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">With cannon-flash and noise of hurrying shell:</l>
							<l>O prisons, open for returning, light,</l>
