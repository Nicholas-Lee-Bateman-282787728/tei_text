                    <p>The following account of the life and labors of the Rev. Allen Wiley is taken from a sermon
                        preached on the occasion of his death, by Rev. F. C. Holliday, in this city on the 20th of
                        August, 1848.</p>
                    <p>Allen Wiley was born in <placeName>
                     <region type="county">Frederick County</region>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                  </placeName>, January 15, 1789, and emigrated
                        with his parents to the State of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                        </placeName> in 1797, and to <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Dearborn county</region>
                        </placeName>, Indiana, in 1804. In 1818 he was married to Margaret Eads. He joined the Methodist
                        Episcopal Church April 18, 1810, as a seeker of religion, under the ministry of Rev. Moses
                        Crume, and made a profession of religion in the June following. He was licensed to exhort,
                        September 10, 1811, and licensed to preach, July 10, 1813, by Rev. Moses Langdon. He commenced
                        traveling the first of December, 1816. He was ordained a Deacon by Bishop McKendree, August 25,
                        1818; and ordained an Elder by Bishop Roberts, August 13, 1820.</p>
                    <p>The following is a list of the appointments which he filled during his ministry: In 1817 he was
                        appointed to <placeName>

                        the Residing Elder. In 1818, he traveled Whitewater Circuit; 1819, <placeName>

                        stationed in the Centenary Church, <placeName>

                        </placeName>. October, 1847, he took a superannuated relation, and removed his family to <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                        </placeName> in <placeName>

                        </placeName>, Ind., where he died after a brief illness of four days, on Sabbath, July 23, 1848,
                        in the 59th year of his age, and the 31st of his itinerant ministry.</p>
                    <pb n="2" id="VAA4025-023-1-008"/>
                    <p>Eleven years of his ministry were spent in traveling extensive and laborious circuits, the
                        streams un bridged, bad roads, and frequently none at all. Fourteen years he was Presiding
                        Elder, and a part of that time his district extended from the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> to
                        the lakes, and required an amount of energy, sacrifice, and toil, of which it is now difficult
                        to conceive. Five years he spent in our principal towns as a stationed preacher, and no station
                        ever had a more faithful pastor than Allen Wiley. Besides the above appointments, he was elected
                        and served as a delegate in the general conferences of 1832, 1836, 1840, and 1844. When Bro.
                        Wiley entered the ministry in 1817, the membership in the Methodist Episcopal church, North of
                        the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>, in the territory extending from the Eastern line of the
                        State of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                        </placeName>, to the Province of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                        </placeName>, was less than 22,000. When he died, that same territory contained eight annual
                        conferences, exclusive of the two in the State of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                        </placeName>, and the Indian Mission conference, and contains a membership of 215,000 and more
                        than 2,000 local preachers, besides the traveling ministers. In this rapid extension of the
                        Redeemer's kingdom, he bore a very conspicuous and an efficient part. It was once
                        remarked by an intelligent lawyer, not a member of the Methodist church, that Allen Wiley had
                        done more to improve the manners and morals of Indiana than any other citizen in it. In 1825, <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                        </placeName> and Indiana were separated from the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                        </placeName> conference, and formed what was then denominated the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                        </placeName> conference, and contained a membership considerably less than 10,000; now the same
                        territory contains between 80,000 and 90,000 Methodists. When the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                        </placeName> conference was formed in 1825, Bro. Wiley became a member of the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                        </placeName> conference; and when the Indiana conference was formed in 1832, Bro. Wiley fell
                        within the bounds of the Indiana conference; and although he had been a member of the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                        </placeName> and <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                        </placeName> conferences, Indiana was his principal field of labor, for out of 30 appointments,
                        27 of them were exclusively in Indiana. When the Indiana conference was organized, in 1832, it
                        contained a membership of but little over 19,000; now the Indiana conferences contain a
                        membership of 58,000. And that Bro. Wiley contributed considerably to this numerical increase,
                        is apparent from the success that attended his ministry while engaged as a circuit preacher.
                        During the first four years of his ministry, the net increase on his fields of labor was 1,189.
                        He formed the first Bible societies in Indiana, and early formed his quarterly meeting
                        conferences into Temperance societies. Frankness, conscientiousness, decision, perseverance, and
                        industry, were prominent traits in his character. His sermons were principally doctrinal and
                        practical. He was a man of facts and not of fancy. There was but little of the flower of poetry
                        or the grace of rhetoric about his sermons, but the hearers who were not too lazy to think, and
                        who had the patience to follow him through his sermons, and the intelligence to appreciate them,
                        always heard him with profit.</p>

            <p rend="center">No. I</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="sc">R</hi>. E<hi rend="sc">DITOR</hi>—You are aware, from a previous notice and
                    several conversations with you, that I have purposed, for some time, to present the public with some
                    notice of the commencement and progress of Methodism in the southeastern part of Indiana. I am
                    impelled to this from several considerations. First, the public ought to have the information.
                    Secondly, I have had personal knowledge of much of the country and the progress of society in it,
                    for more than forty years. Thirdly, I have traveled, as a minister, all the country bordering on the
                        <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> from the Little Miami in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> down to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> in Indiana, extending back into the country a distance varying from twenty-five to near
                    two hundred miles. Fourthly, there is no other man living, who has had so long and intimate
                    acquaintance with the matters connected with this subject as myself, to perform the labor of
                    collecting and arranging the information.</p>
            <p>As I shall have to depend on my memory alone for much of the matter in these numbers, there must,
                    unavoidably, be many omissions, and defects, and some mistakes. But even these imperfections of my
                    performance may do good by moving others to correct them, so that between us the truth will be more
                    fully exhibited. You perceive that I virtually invite corrections, which will not offend me if they
                    are made in the spirit of kindness. In all cases, if convinced of mistakes, retraction will be made;
                    but if not convinced, I shall abide by my statements.</p>
            <p>One thing, however, will be to me exceedingly mortifying, and that is, having been so long and
                    intimately and extensively connected with the progress of the country and the work, I shall have to
                    give myself a prominence which I do not like. I will endeavor, however, to avoid egotism, and
                    present others as prominently as I can.</p>
            <p>The notice which I may take of the southern part of the field over which I propose to travel, must of
                    necessity be very superficial, from that want of full information to make it otherwise; and I shall
                    not feel at all mortified if I provoke <pb n="4" id="VAA4025-023-1-010"/> some brother to travel
                    over the same ground, and do it more ample justice than I can at present.</p>
            <p>Although you have, from time to time, urged me to this work, yet I fear, if I can keep up my courage,
                    and overcome my almost unconquerable reluctance to write, especially for the press, you will find
                    too much of it for your paper. Of this, however, you must be the judge.</p>
            <p>In presenting this subject to the public, I deem it expedient to take some notice of the early
                    settlement of the country. Up to the year 1800, all that part of the country north of the
                        <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>, and south of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> on the east, to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> on the west, and to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake</region>
                    </placeName> of the Woods on the northwest, was called the Northwestern territory. On the 4th day of
                    July of this year, the territory was divided by Congress into two parts, the line beginning on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> opposite the mouth of the <geogName>Kentucky river</geogName>, and running east of
                    north to Fort Recovery, and from thence north to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> line, thus leaving most of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, the whole of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName>, a part of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin</region>
                    </placeName>, a part of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, and a part of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Randolph counties</region>
                    </placeName>, now in Indiana, in connection with the now state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The western was called the Indiana territory, embracing the now states of Indiana,
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>, <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
               </placeName>, and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> territory. In 1802, the Northwestern territory became the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and a line due north from the mouth of the Great <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> became its western boundary, so that the tract east of the line from opposite the mouth
                    of the <geogName>Kentucky river</geogName> to Fort Recovery became a part of Indiana. A part of the
                    public lands in this tract came into market in 1800 or 1801, and another part farther west in the
                    fall of 1804. Subsequently a purchase was made which we have commonly known as the Fifty Mile
                    purchase. This purchase lies west of the line commencing opposite the mouth of the
                        <geogName>Kentucky river</geogName>. At what time it was brought into market, I do not know.
                    After this, a narrow purchase was made, being twelve miles wide, beginning south of the west fork of
                        <geogName>White Water river</geogName>, and running east of north until it reached the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> state line. This purchase was offered for sale in 1811, <pb n="5" id="VAA4025-023-1-011"/> and much of it sold very readily as it was a valuable body of land.</p>
            <p>Near the Falls of the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>, there was a tract of land of one hundred and
                    fifty thousand acres, designed to be bounty lands for the soldiers under the command of General
                    Clark. This tract was called Clark's Grant. The first settlement in <hi rend="b">the</hi>
                    southeast part of Indiana, was made at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clarksville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, near the lower part of the Falls, nearly opposite <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It is said to have been made in 1785.</p>
            <p>The next settlement in the east of Indiana, was made in what has been long known as the Big Bottom,
                    above the mouth of Tanner's creek. At what time this part began to be settled, I know not;
                    but I remember when my father moved from <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Frederick county</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, and settled, in the month of
                    May, 1797, where <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Petersburg</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, now is, there were two or three families on this
                    side of the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>. Between the time last mentioned and the sale of the
                    lands in 1800 or 1801, several families had settled in the Big Bottom and in the lower part of the
                        <geogName>White Water valley</geogName>. Among others, Mr. James Eads, the father of my wife,
                    with his family settled about three or four miles below where the town of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison</region>
                    </placeName> now is, in about 1799. Whether any families settled on the Indiana side of the state
                    line on White Water so early, I am not informed; but from the apparent ages of many of the farms
                    when I first became acquainted with them, I should suppose they had been settled as early as 1800.</p>
            <p>Since writing the above, I have learned several families settled prior to 1800.</p>
            <p>I have stated, that my father settled where Petersburg now is, in 1797. After remaining there a year
                    and a half, he moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette county</region>
                    </placeName> [<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>] eight miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he remained until the autumn of 1804, when he came to Indiana, and settled about
                    three miles above where <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison</region>
                    </placeName> now stands, I being then in the latter part of my sixteenth year. The country was then
                    somewhat densely settled along the river, up to what was called the lower narrows, six or seven
                    miles above where White Water leaves Indiana and enters <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. As well as I remember there was one family <pb n="6" id="VAA4025-023-1-012"/> on the
                    southwest side of the river opposite the before-mentioned narrows; another family on the same side
                    opposite the narrows above the present town of New Trenton; and another on the same side in the
                    bottom below the present town of, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rochester</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Three-quarters of a mile above Big Cedar Grove creek, Mr. John Conner, an Indian
                    trader (and who afterward laid out the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the county town of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette county</region>
                    </placeName>) had a store kept by a Frenchman; hence, the store was called the French store. I have
                    now gone to the <hi rend="i">ultima thule</hi>, or farthest verge of the white population in the
                        <geogName>White Water valley</geogName> in 1804. There were a few families on what was called
                    Johnson's Fork, a small stream which empties into the river about three miles above its
                    entrance into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1805, two settlements were formed on the east fork of White Water. The one a little
                    south of the present town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName>, was called the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> settlement, because most of the families were from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. The other was some distance above the present town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, near where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> now stands and was called the Carolina settlement, because most of the families were
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="scu">South Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>. The same spring Mr. William Tyner, a respectable Baptist minister, settled about one
                    and a half miles below <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Mr. Thomas Williams, one mile above, on the south side of the west fork of the
                    river. At that time, I presume the land on which the present flourishing town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> now stands belonged to the government. At the period of which I now write, the only
                    mill for all the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White Water county</region>
                    </placeName> was on the edge of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, owned by a Mr. Thomas Smith of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, so that the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> settlement had to travel some fifty miles to mill, and the Carolina settlement
                    twenty-five. Sometimes, perhaps, the former settlement went across the country through a wilderness
                    to Four and Seven Mile creeks, near the Great <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName>, because they were some nigher.</p>
            <p>In all the upper White Water country, the aboriginals were numerous who used to come among us for the
                    purpose of traffic, but their great headquarters for that purpose was the before-named French store,
                    owned by Mr. Conner. When the <pb n="7" id="VAA4025-023-1-013"/> Indians visited us, they behaved
                    themselves civilly, and we had no difficulty with them at that time.</p>
            <p>In 1802, the Indiana territory contained four or five counties, Indiana proper three, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> one or two. The three in Indiana were, one on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, called Knox, being much the oldest settlement in Indiana; another on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, near the Falls, called Clark, after the general of that name; and another partly on
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, above the mouth of the <geogName>Kentucky river</geogName>, and partly bordering on
                    the west line of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> state, and extending as far north as the northeast corner of the present county of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Randolph</region>
                    </placeName>, in Indiana, called Dearborn. Of the line of demarkation between <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark</region>
                    </placeName>, I know nothing. This civil division in the Indiana part of the territory remained
                    until 1808, when <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison county</region>
                    </placeName> was created out of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark</region>
                    </placeName>; and in November, 1810, a law was passed, creating <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson county</region>
                    </placeName> out of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName>; and the same month, a law passed, creating two new counties out of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark</region>
                    </placeName>, to be called Franklin and Wayne; so that in February, 1811, there were added three new
                    counties to the former four. How <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark county</region>
                    </placeName> had any connection with the now territory of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, I know not, unless the before mentioned fifty-mile purchase was a part of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark county</region>
                    </placeName>; for the northeast corner of that purchase is included in the southwest corner of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin county</region>
                    </placeName>. It would be foreign from my purpose to say anything about that part of the territory
                    of Indiana now included in the present state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>When Congress passed the ordinance in 1800, separating the Indiana territory, it ordained that
                    whenever the territory should have five thousand free white male inhabitants over twenty-one years
                    of age, the territory should be entitled to a delegate in Congress, which right we did not enjoy
                    until 1808, (if my memory be correct, for I have no document on the subject) when Jesse B. Thomas
                    (now a judge in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>) was sent as said delegate. I find, by examining the laws of this year, that Mr. Thomas
                    was speaker of the House of Representatives of the territory, on the 24th of October; and Mr.
                    General Washington Johnson occupying <pb n="8" id="VAA4025-023-1-014"/> the same post on the 25th of
                    the same month so that I infer that the legislature elected Mr. Thomas to Congress and thereby
                    vacated his seat in the legislature. Not having, the journal of that day, I have to mix inferences
                    with remembered facts.</p>
            <p>From the foregoing statement, the reader must perceive that the country settled very slowly to
                    require eight years for this great western region to have five thousand free white males of full
                    age. The following facts will account for this slow progress: First, the Indian title being
                    extinguished only on a few tracts on the borders of Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>; secondly, the high price of the government land being at the lowest two dollars per
                    acre; thirdly, the absurd manner of selling those lands. At first, they were sold only in sections
                    of one mile square; afterwards in half sections; and in 1804 in quarter sections. The purchaser paid
                    one-fourth in advance, another fourth in two years; another in three years; and another in four. If
                    in any case he failed to make payment at the time, he was charged six per cent interest from the
                    date of his entry. If he failed to complete his payments at the end of the fourth year, he was
                    allowed one year of grace, the interest, however, accruing all the time; and he lost what he had
                    paid, and all his labor of improving his land. Fourthly, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> being an older country attracted more of public attention. The wonder is, that the
                    country improved as fast as it did, under the grinding process of the land sales; particularly in
                    view of the then scarcity of money in the west in general.</p>
            <p>In the winter of 1809, Congress divided the territory into two parts—the Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> territories, which "raised the dander" of some of us, as we were
                    anxious to become a state which we despaired of doing soon, after being divided; and when Mr. Thomas
                    returned home we complained to him about his course in this matter; but he pleaded the original
                    ordinance of Congress for his justification, which declared the Northwestern territory should be
                    three or more states.</p>
            <p>In 1810, Indiana was promoted to a higher grade of territorial government, the people being permitted
                    to elect their <pb n="9" id="VAA4025-023-1-015"/> delegate to Congress. Under this form we remained
                    until 1816, when the territory became a state. Before this period, however, there was formed in 1814
                    a new county out of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName>, called <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, because there was in it a considerable settlement of sober, harmless and industrious
                    Swiss, who had somewhat extensively cultivated the grape above the mouth of Indian creek, opposite
                    the <geogName>Kentucky river</geogName>. At a later day there were organized two new counties in the
                        <geogName>White Water valley</geogName>, one embracing the west and the other the east
                    fork—the one called Fayette, and the other Union; also another partly in the
                        <geogName>White Water valley</geogName>, and partly on the upper waters of the west branch of
                        <geogName>White river</geogName>, called <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Randolph</region>

                    this narrative. I shall mention their county seats, when I come to my main object, in detailing the
                    commencement and progress of Methodism in the parts of the country which I propose to notice.</p>
            <p>A few more words on the general features of the country, and I shall have done with this part of the
                    subject. That part of Clark's Grant which lies on the east of Silver creek, contains a
                    large amount of most excellent land, which induced an early emigration from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and other parts. That part of <placeName>

                    </placeName> on the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>, and in the <geogName>White Water
                    valley</geogName>, which was first settled, is among the most fertile parts of the country. The

            <p>With the character of the first inhabitants in Clark's Grant, I am not so well acquainted;
                    but from the specimens of them which remained when I traveled <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>
                    </placeName> circuit during two years, commencing in the summer of 1825, I should judge they were a
                    sober, harmless, enterprising, and <pb n="10" id="VAA4025-023-1-016"/> industrious people, who
                    formed a good moral soil for the reception of Gospel seed, which was first sowed in that part of
                    Indiana. They had many descendants remaining in that section of the country when I traveled there,
                    who were a most estimable people, and who seemed disposed to copy the worthy example of the
                    venerable pioneer patriarchs, some of whom still remained to bless the rising race; but they are now
                    mostly gone. A very few, here and there one, still linger on the verge of time, kindly left by
                    Providence, to show the present generation a specimen of what their fathers were.</p>
            <p>The early settlers on the Big Bottom were, in the main, a shade inferior to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Grant</region>
                    </placeName> people in intellectual and moral worth; and the fertility of the soil, and the
                    facilities of trade, have so tended to accumulate the wealth of the owners of the land, that
                    literature and moral culture have been too much neglected, in a most absorbing devotion to mammon.
                    How this state of things is to be bettered, I cannot see; for this wealth and the strong desire for
                    it, descend from father to son, and there is a prospect that they will continue to do so for some
                    generations yet to come. There are, however, some exceptions to this too general state of society.</p>
            <p>The first settlers in the White Water bottoms (for few settled elsewhere) were in many respects a
                    charming people. When I became acquainted with them in 1804, they were generally a sober,
                    industrious, harmless, and kind-hearted people. It is true, they had not much literature or
                    religion, but for natural amiableness, I doubt whether any other part of the world could present a
                    superior or even equal number of such persons, in an equal amount of population. Circumstances had
                    much to do in making them what they were.</p>
            <p>In the first place, most of them came there with moderate means, being only able to pay one-fourth on
                    their land. They then had to fell the dense forest, build their cabins, and till the soil, with a
                    view to support their families, and pay the remaining three-fourths on their land in the coming four
                    years, which many of them were not able to do, but were necessitated to sell to the new comers. By
                    this means, many of them were able to pay for a tract of land farther in the <pb n="11" id="VAA4025-023-1-017"/> wilderness. Thus many a noble but poor man had to settle twice, or
                    more, in the forest, before he had a home which he could call his own.</p>
            <p>A second cause of the good state of society was owing to their dependence on one another. As little
                    use was then made of cattle, or horses, in rolling logs, it required many men to roll the logs in
                    the heavily timbered clearings in the rich White Water bottoms; so that between log-rollings and
                    cabin-raisings, we were together several days in each week for a month or two in the spring of the
                    year. There was another cause of gathering us together in the fall season. The rich, fresh bottoms
                    yielded such amounts of corn as the natives of older and poorer parts of the Union would have been
                    astonished to see. I know this was the case with myself, although I was from the rich Elkhorn land
                    in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Fayette county</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. Well, this corn was pulled from the stalks, and it required a
                    tall man to reach many of the ears, and if he were a low man, or a boy, he had to pull the stalks
                    down to himself. When pulled, it was hauled into large, long piles to be stripped of its husks at
                    night: hence, almost every night in the week, except Sunday night, we were at a cornhusking in the
                    corn gathering time. At these cornhuskings, there was much good feeling and innocent humor.
                    Generally the corn heap was divided into two parts, by laying rails or poles across the heap, as
                    nearly equal as could be guessed at, and two respectable men constituted captains, who, by alternate
                    choice divided the men and boys into two equal companies, and then we went to work with as much
                    earnestness as the French and allied armies at the battle of Waterloo, but with none of their unkind
                    feelings and murderous purposes; and this good-natured strife would last without one
                    minute's intermission from three to six hours; for, sometimes when there was a prospect of
                    finishing a large pile, we would work till near midnight. Another thing which made these spring and
                    fall gatherings most interesting and pleasant, was the number of females which attended them; not,
                    however, to roll the logs, raise the cabin, or husk the corn, but to assist in preparing the food
                    for those who were doing the out-door work; so that <pb n="12" id="VAA4025-023-1-018"/> when the men
                    and boys came in at meal-time they found the long temporary table spread, and smiling women and
                    girls to welcome them to wholesome, plain food. And although there was but little of that shyness
                    and restraint imposed by the conventional rules of what is called refined society, yet, I must say,
                    I fully believe there never was the same number of truly virtuous and kind men and women, lads and
                    lasses, in any settlement of the same size on this green earth, as then lived in the <geogName>White
                        Water valley</geogName>.</p>
            <p>One thing more made our fall meeting most delightful. In the early settling of the country, the
                    luxuriant vegetation in a state of decay, and the dense fogs in August and September, gave many of
                    us the ague, which we generally permitted to take its own course, and leave us of its own accord.
                    Sometimes, however, we used to take pills made from the inner bark of the white walnut, or
                    butternut, as some call it, and drink some kind of herb tea. Reader, did you ever have a long siege
                    of the ague, when in its latter stages you could have the chill or shake in the morning, the fever
                    about noon, and toward evening eat like a half-starved dog? If you have never had this experience,
                    you never knew what a pleasure it is to eat fat pork, wild turkeys, venison hams, pumpkin pies, and
                    good corn bread, after the ague has wholly left you about corn-husking time.</p>
            <p>It will be perceived, I say nothing about harvest gathering, and for this good reason, we had none,
                    or nearly none; for our <hi rend="b">bottoms</hi> while fresh, though they would bring cords of
                    straw, would not yield good wheat.</p>
            <p>The aristocratic feelings produced by unsanctified wealth on the one hand, and the envy and jealousy
                    of the evil part of the indigent on the other, which make two castes in older communities, and that
                    hateful political chasm, as deep, and wide, and vile as ever intervened between the Jews and
                    Samaritans, which now divides the Whigs and Democrats of our day, were then unknown. So that when we
                    met at any of our business meetings, or social meetings, or religious meetings (for we sometimes had
                    these) we felt as a band of brothers and sisters. If the males could get good wool <pb n="13" id="VAA4025-023-1-019"/> hats, good common shoes, (for I suppose there was not a pair of fine
                    boots in all the settlement) and homespun clothes, we felt as well contented, or more so, than in
                    the richest costume of the present day. If the females could get good calico sun-bonnets, or
                    something a little in advance of these, good cotton gowns, in most cases the work of their own
                    hands, from the picking, carding, spinning, dyeing and weaving, up to making, and other things in
                    keeping with these, they would have felt themselves prepared for the respectful attentions of any
                    gentleman in these <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Indeed, I have seen the most worthy of both sexes at meeting with moccasins on their
                    feet. Gentle reader, the most perfect in the symmetry of their persons and most accomplished in
                    their minds, (for to some extent they had mental accomplishments) would as soon have thought of
                    drowning themselves in White Water as to have cramped the free breathing of their lungs, and the
                    healthy flow of their heart's warm blood, by the present foolish, wicked, and most suicidal
                    practice of tight lacing and other kindred vices of modern times. And, be it remembered, they
                    enjoyed the comfort and utility of their wise course; for many of them, when they became mothers,
                    could spin, weave, knit, sew, wash, mend and cook for large families, and be cheerful and merry at
                    night and vigorous and lively in the morning. When I see many poor languid females of the present
                    day, that are mere apologies for wives and mothers, who, if they have to take care of one or two
                    children without a nurse and make a few calico gowns (and some of them not even these) and do a few
                    other small matters, seem to think they are about to die with hard times, I feel almost
                    irrepressible emotions of indignation and pity—indignation at the injury which folly and
                    false kindness have done them, and pity for the real sufferings of the poor, unfortunate, unhappy
                    creatures. Let the thoughtful reflect and avoid misery by avoiding its cause; for none can do
                    violence to nature without suffering the penalty of that violence; nature will avenge her injured
                    rights.</p>
            <p>From the foregoing statements, the reader must perceive, that there was but one thing wanting to make
                    us as happy as <pb n="14" id="VAA4025-023-1-020"/> human beings can be in this probationary world;
                    and that thing was, true, vital godliness, some of which was enjoyed in that day, but not under the
                    form of Methodism. In my next I will endeavor to take some notice of the religious aspects of the
                    country.</p>

            <p rend="center">No. III</p>
            <p>In taking a view of the religious aspects of the country, I will have to cross the line into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and look at the state of things always much connected with eastern Indiana in its
                    religious movements. The people west of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and Indiana were from various parts of the world, and consequently there was no
                    sameness of views and feelings among them on the subject of religion. But as the larger portion of
                    them were from the south portion of the land, especially from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, where the Baptist denomination was then dominant, that became the prevailing
                    denomination of this new country. Another circumstance tended to the same result. In a very early
                    day in the latter part of the eighteenth century, several popular and influential Baptist ministers
                    settled in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Boon county</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, contiguous to this new region. These ministers were
                    successful in raising up a very large church of their own order, many of whom became ministers, who
                    frequently visited the <geogName>White Water valley</geogName> and other parts. Indeed, nearly all
                    the preaching on this side the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> was by these <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> preachers, both before and for sometime after my acquaintance with the country. In that
                    early time, so exclusively was our preaching of the Baptist order, that I remember but one exception
                    and that was only occasionally. The exception was Mr. John Brown, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a Congregational, or Independent minister, I think, who used to preach to us
                    sometimes. He was regarded as a very talented man, but not very deeply pious. Mr. Brown published a
                    newspaper called the <hi rend="i">Liberty Hall</hi>, which, I think, was the second paper in that
                    then small town. Mr. Henry Harding, the original proprietor of Hardings-burg, near Law-renceburg,
                    was a member of the Baptist church, at whose <pb n="15" id="VAA4025-023-1-021"/> house there used to
                    be preaching in those days; but I think there was no church organized. The first meeting-house, it
                    is presumed, ever built in the <geogName>White Water valley</geogName> was on Lee's creek,
                    a small branch of the Dry Fork of White Water. The house was about three miles east of the present
                    town of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison</region>
                    </placeName>. It was a small log house; and, if I remember right, had a puncheon floor and clapboard
                    roof. I used to attend there frequently, though it was six miles from home; for, although not
                    religious, all my educational prejudices were in favor of the Baptist church. I can remember hearing
                    Dr. [Ezra] Ferris, now of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, preach there at a very early period. His text was, "As the mountains are
                    round about Jerusalem so the Lord is round about his people." Of course, he gave us the
                    views of his church on final perseverance. Who was the pastor, and what was the strength of the
                    church, I know not: it must, however, have been pretty strong for the time; for it used to be a
                    place of holding Associations occasionally.</p>
            <p>The next place of holding meetings was at Mr. Jacob Hackleman's, a very worthy man from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="scu">South Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, of German descent. Mr. Hackleman's house yet stands a little on the rise of
                    the hill, about one mile and a half above Johnson's Fork. Here a church was constituted in
                    the spring or summer of 1805, and Mr. Tyner, (before named) the son-in-law of Mr. Hackleman, became
                    pastor. There is an impression on my mind, that he afterward became the pastor of the Lee's
                    creek church also; but this may not be the fact. Mr. Tyner had not had the advantages of an
                    extensive literary training; but he was a warm-hearted, honest, active, good man, who preached with
                    great zeal, and some success. He is yet living, far advanced in life, but still preaches in the
                    southwest of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur county</region>
                    </placeName>, where he now lives. Were he dead, I would say much more in his praise; for he was a
                    useful man; but would have been much more so, if his views of predestination had not greatly
                    neutralized his warm sermons and exhortations.</p>
            <p>Shortly, after the church was organized at the house of Mr. Hackleman, either in the fall of 1805, or
                    summer of 1806, <pb n="16" id="VAA4025-023-1-022"/> the members of the church and the citizens built
                    a log meetinghouse in old style with a gallery in it. The house was on the southwest corner of Mr.
                    Hackleman's land. If ever the reader should travel the road from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he will see an old house to the right of the road, where he turns a right angle to the
                    north, and where there is a small graveyard inclosed to itself. That old house is the first
                    meetinghouse ever built in the <geogName>White Water valley</geogName> on the Indiana side of the
                    line. To the great disgrace of somebody, for I know not who, that old house is now desecrated by
                    being turned into a barn, with a stable attached. That house ought to be handsomely inclosed, and
                    permitted to stand till the hand of time demolishes it. It makes me feel mournful and sad when I see
                    that old house in its present condition. Many of the members, who used to worship in this church,
                    are scattered, some by death, and others by removal. Only a very few of the original pillars remain;
                    but others have joined them; and they now have a good brick church a little way below
                    Johnson's Fork; but whether they have a regular pastor of stated services, I am not
                    informed.</p>
            <p>The next place of worship erected, and not long after the last noticed, (for the country filled up
                    with much rapidity to the river) was a small log house on the hill, a little below Little Cedar
                    Grove creek, about three miles below <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The house stood a few years, and was burned down; after which a medium sized brick
                    house was built on the same ground. Here there still remains a Baptist church, respectable for
                    numbers and standing. Whether Mr. Tyner, or Mr. Dewese, was their early pastor, I cannot say; but
                    the probability is, the former; for the latter did not move to the White Water region until several
                    years after; but he visited it frequently.</p>
            <p>Mr. Dewese was a most estimable man. His preaching was short, and full of good manly sense, and
                    withal truly evangelical. Although he was firmly established in the doctrines of his church, yet
                    there was so little of sectarian bigotry in his preaching, that all denominations were fond of
                    hearing him. Perhaps no man ever lived in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin county</region>
                    </placeName>, who <pb n="17" id="VAA4025-023-1-023"/> maintained a more unblemished character than
                    Lewis Dewese. If Pope is right in saying that <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>"An honest man's the noblest work of God",</p>
                    </quote> he should be ranked among the noble works of God's grace. He lived piously, and
                    died suddenly, and, doubtless, rests in peace. He was a great ornament to his denomination. Mr.
                    Wilson, another of this order, who came from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> to this country rather early, and settled two miles above Brook-ville, was a very
                    popular preacher among his own people, and did much to advance the interests of his church.</p>
            <p>Several of the families in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> settlement, before described, were in communion with the Baptist church; and, soon
                    after their arrival at their new homes, were organized into a church, and prospered. At what time
                    they built their meeting-house on Elkhorn, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName> I cannot say; but from the appearance of the house, and the graveyard, which is
                    inclosed with a good stone wall, it must have been long since.</p>
            <p>The Carolina settlement were partly Baptists and partly Presbyterians in their preferences, but I
                    think they formed no early church organizations; the Baptist part of them united with neighboring
                    churches. All the churches noticed were organized and in successful operation before our
                    denomination had any existence in the country. Indeed, it will be perceived that our Baptist friends
                    were in possession of the country long before any other denomination had a place for the sole of its
                    foot; and doubtless much good was done by the numerous ministers, visiting and resident, of that
                    order. At the present, compared with some other denominations, the Baptist church is on the
                    background. The reader may be ready to inquire, why this is the case, when they had the start of all
                    others? Without intending anything invidious, or wishing to hurt the feelings of any man, a candid
                    answer shall be given.</p>
            <p>First, the time has passed by for the peculiarities of Calvinism to be received by the public at
                    large, with any degree of cordiality. The ministers, however, of this order have <pb n="18" id="VAA4025-023-1-024"/> preached these peculiarities with more untiring zeal than almost any
                    other. Secondly, the undue stress laid on water baptism causes them to neglect the constant
                    inculcations of the more weighty matters of Christian morality. Thirdly, the neglect of, if not, in
                    some instances, the direct opposition to, the benevolent enterprises of the day in Bible, tract,
                    missionary, temperance and Sunday school associations. Fourthly, the followers of Mr. Alexander
                    Campbell have rent many of their churches into fragments. Upon the whole, I see nothing awaiting the
                    "old Baptist" churches but utter annihilation, when the present membership dies
                    off, but their places will be occupied by a new and more catholic race, who will go in for all the
                    benevolent operations of the times in which we live.</p>
            <p>Whether the same orders were the early occupants of Clark's Grant I have no means of
                    ascertaining; but from the number of families who were members of that church, and partial to it,
                    when I traveled in the grant, I should suppose they were among the first who made a religious
                    commencement in that delightful region; especially as many of the people came from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, where the Baptists were once more numerous, perhaps, than all other denominations
                    together.</p>
            <p>In all the county bordering on the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> between the mouth of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Grant</region>
                    </placeName>, the Baptists were the prevailing denomination in the first settlements formed in
                    consequence of their contiguity to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, which abounded in ministers of that order, of almost all grades of talent, who came
                    over the river, and zealously taught their doctrines and usages with considerable success. But from
                    the causes already named, this people are greatly on the wane, relatively in this section of the
                    land, also. Not that they are actually fewer in numbers and influence, so as to leave them in the
                    rear, but others have advanced in numbers and influence.</p>
            <p>When I speak in this number of the prospective annihilation of the old Baptist churches, I more
                    particularly mean the country churches; for the all-controlling influence of circumstances will
                    modernize their churches in the towns and <pb n="19" id="VAA4025-023-1-025"/> cities, where they
                    have to commingle with other denominations in the cause of benevolence in its various forms. If the
                    ministers and churches in the cities would take much pains in a prudent way with the ministers and
                    churches in the country, by diffusing among them literary and religious periodicals so as to let
                    them know what is going on in the world, and thereby stir up their friends, so as to induce them to
                    feel a deep interest and take an active part in the benevolent doings of the truly Christian
                    community, they might prevent the doom which I have said awaits them. I hold it as a matter of fact,
                    in this, the ninetenth century of the Christian era, that no church can be indifferent and neutral
                    in regard to the world's conversion, and be innocent before God, and be prosperous as a
                    church. No, no, it can never be, as results will prove to all.</p>
            <p>Although I differ from the Baptist church in many things, yet there are fond recollections which give
                    me a lively interest in it. I look back seventy-seven years, the second day of next month, when my
                    father was born; and I fancy I see my grandfather a large resolute man, whose name I bear, at that
                    very time standing at the window of the prison in which he was confined for nonconformity to the
                    Episcopal church, in the colony of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, and preaching in peals of thunder to the thronging crowds collected outside of the
                    house. I think of James Ireland, the first preacher I ever heard, so far as I remember, confined
                    about the same time, and for the same cause, almost suffocated to death, from the smoke of sulphur
                    matches, which a wicked man burned under the prison. I think of my grandfather and mother, and
                    greatgrandfather and mother on my mother's side, and how strict they were in rearing their
                    children. Among my first recollections, I remember to have seen my uncles kneeling by their beds in
                    prayer before they laid down, as they were taught by their parents and when one of them was humming
                    a few words, which I do not remember, another told his father, that his brother was singing carnal
                    songs on Sunday. 0, ye Baptists of this day, imitate these examples, and God will bless you.</p>

            <p>Having noticed the early settlement of the country, the state of society, and the pioneer influence
                    of the Baptists, I will now pursue my main design, to give an account of the doings of the
                    Methodists. Not having the information which I hope to receive concerning the introduction of
                    Methodism in Clark's Grant, which was its early cradle, I will treat, in the present
                    number, concerning its introduction in the White Water country, and parts contiguous.</p>
            <p>When I came to White Water in the fall of 1804, there were only two men on it, so far as I know, who
                    had ever been Methodists, and these were Mr. James Cole and Mr. Benjamin M'Carty. In the
                    fall of 1805 or winter of 1806, another man by the name of Enoch Smith came and lived on my
                    father's farm. Cole was an illiterate, excitable man, who frequently involved himself and
                    others in unpleasant collisions, which more than once procured his expulsion from the church; but,
                    upon the whole, I think, he meant well, for when convinced of his faults, he would repent and
                    reform, and try the good old way again. M'Carty had been an exhorter or local preacher in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, from whence he came, but he was originally a Virginian. He settled on White Water in
                    the summer of 1803, but as there was no Methodist society in his vicinity, and as he was rather
                    fallen from his religious enjoyments, he did not exercise his gifts as a religious teacher, for
                    sometime after he came to the country. He was a respectable man, of good common sense, with a
                    moderate share of literary acquirements. He afterward became a local preacher of medium talents, and
                    for several years occupied a seat on the bench of the county court of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin county</region>
                    </placeName>, as one of the judges. He lived a number of years, as a member of the Methodist
                    Episcopal church and an approved local preacher; but from some small differences of opinion and
                    practice from his church he withdrew, and connected himself with the United Brethren, in which
                    communion he died a few years since. Smith was sincerely attached to the church of his choice, but
                    not very zealous. His wife, however, was a most devoted <pb n="21" id="VAA4025-023-1-027"/> and
                    pious woman, who was one of the main pillars in the church after its formation. These persons, with
                    a few others, met together and drew up and sent a memorial, or petition, to the Western conference,
                    or to John Sale, of precious memory, who was presiding elder on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> district in said conference; which then embraced the <geogName>Holston</geogName>,

               </placeName>, and Natchez districts.
                    The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> district then embraced all the settled country in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, east of the Great <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName>, and two circuits in western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. In their petition, they asked for a regular traveling preacher to be sent to them to
                    preach and form societies. After the petition had been sent on, Mr. M'Carty commenced
                    preaching in different parts of the neighborhood, and the people began to learn something of
                    Methodist doctrines, but nothing of the economy and usages of Methodism as there were no societies
                    formed, and of course no class meetings and other kindred institutions of the church.</p>
            <p>In March, 1806, John Sale, the presiding elder on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> district sent Joseph Oglesby (now Dr. Oglesby, of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="iau">Ia.</region>
               </placeName>) from the
                    Little Kanawha circuit, to form a new circuit west of the Great <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName>, to be called White Water circuit. Brother Oglesby, in a short communication drawn up
                    in a hurry for my use, says, he was sent from Marietta circuit; but as I find no circuit of that
                    name on the Minutes at that time, I suppose Marietta formed a part of the circuit before named; and
                    as he probably set out from Marietta, his mind would be impressed that that was the name of the
                    circuit.</p>
            <p>Brother Oglesby writes to me, that he commenced his labors at the house of Moses Crume, (who will be
                    more particularly noticed in these sketches) who was a local preacher that moved first from <placeName>

               </placeName>, and settled on Cotton Run, a few miles north of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton</region>
                    </placeName>, the county town of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Butler county</region>
                    </placeName>, then called Fort Hamilton, doubtless after that distinguished statesman, Alexander
                    Hamilton. A few miles from Crume's lived a substantial farmer by the name of John Gray, on
                    Four Mile creek, four miles from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton</region>
                    </placeName>. Brother Oglesby went there to hunt a preaching place, but Mr. Gray <pb n="22" id="VAA4025-023-1-028"/> was not at home. Mrs. Gray consented that there might be preaching at
                    night, for although she and her husband were not religious yet they had been used to Methodist
                    preaching in the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>, from whence they came.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Gray came home in the afternoon, and learned the arrangement which his wife and the preacher
                    had made, he was much disconcerted, as it would conflict with some business arrangement which he had
                    made. He, however, was a man of too much good feeling and taste to treat his wife and the preacher
                    rudely, and concluded what could not be cured must be endured; and he determined, as he had lost his
                    sleep the night before, to go to bed and sleep. The word, however, kept him awake, and reached his
                    heart, so as to awaken him thoroughly to a sense of danger; and he became the friend of the
                    preaching and preacher, and his house remained God's temple to the day of his death; and
                    his woods, and pastures, and cribs, were freely used many years for the benefit of camp and
                    quarterly meetings. When I traveled <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> circuit in the fall of 1819, and the summer of 1820, brother Gray gave me in detail,
                    what I have stated briefly. Brother Oglesby obtained another place to preach at, not far from the
                    other two just named, and also another southwest from the former, on Indian creek. This last he
                    obtained with some difficulty; but soon formed a society, which continued to flourish for a long
                    time. He then went to the house of a Presbyterian gentleman, by the name of Richardson, who with his
                    family, treated him kindly, but he was unable to form a class. He then directed his course somewhat
                    northward, until he fell on General Wayne's old road from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which seemed still fresh and plain. This he pursued till he came to a Mr.
                    Taylor's, in whose vicinity several families then lived, who were called Newlights. He
                    says, they had shouting times, but he could not form a class.</p>
            <p>Near this place, he fell on an Indian trace which led him to Indiana, to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> settlement which I have before described, in the now county of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>. Here he preached at the house of Mr. Cox, on Elkhorn, a tributary of the East Fork of
                    White Water, where he formed a small society. The <pb n="23" id="VAA4025-023-1-029"/> society was
                    small of necessity; for there were but few people living there; and, as I stated before, a large
                    share of them belonged to the Baptist church. The next preaching place was at Mr.
                    M'Carty's more than forty miles distant, down White Water. Why he passed the
                    Carolina settlement without preaching, I know not, unless he could not obtain a preaching place. Mr.
                    M'Carty's house was near the bank of the river, about seven miles above its
                    entrance into the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. At this place he formed a flourishing society, which remained many years, being
                    afterward removed to Mr. Richard Man-waring's, a little farther down the river. Mr.
                    Manwaring joined the church at an advanced period of life, but became a steady, established member,
                    who kept the preachers and preaching a long time. He afterward moved some short distance above <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and died in a good old age, having been the kind husband of four wives. It was in his
                    house, the writer of these numbers found the Lord. But more of this in some future number.</p>
            <p>From M'Carty's, he went about eleven miles down the river to the house of a Mr.
                    Thomas, where another society was formed. It remained at Thomas' for sometime, but was
                    subsequently moved to the house of a brother Thomas Williams; and after a meeting-house was built in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elizabeth town</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it was moved thither. From thence he went to the house of one Hays (the given name I
                    do not know), in the Big Bottom, between where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elizabethtown</settlement>
                    </placeName> now is and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and formed a society which remained at different private houses many years, but after
                    the houses for preaching were built at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elizabethtown</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hardingsburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>; part of the society went to the one, and part to the other, so that the preaching and
                    society at private houses, between the places named, were discontinued. He also preached at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the county town of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. This town had been laid out in 1802, and had been settled by a very
                    heterogeneous mass from different parts of the world. Religion made slow progress here for some
                    time. The widow [Mrs. Elijah] Sparks who has lived in and near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> more than thirty-nine years, thinks there was no class formed there in <pb n="24" id="VAA4025-023-1-030"/> 1806; but the few members about there went to class at a brother
                    Finley's near Hardingsburg. From <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the preacher started north, up the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName>, preaching at some places on the east, as well as the west side of the river, until the
                    time to start to the Western conference, which was held that year at Ebenezer, (I suppose a
                    meeting-house of this name) on the Nollichuckie, in the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, September 15, 1806. By looking at the Minutes of the conferences for that year, it
                    will be found that this indefatigable man, in the sparse settlements through which he traveled,
                    collected into church fellowship sixty-seven members in the six months which he traveled in this
                    region. The societies then formed constituted the hives out of which many thousands have since
                    swarmed. Many of them are safely lodged in heaven, but many still remain in this and other parts of
                    the earth. Districts, circuits, and stations not a few, have been formed out of the territory then
                    known as the White Water circuit.</p>
            <p>Several things then combined to induce many to attend the preaching. A Methodist circuit rider, as
                    the traveling preachers were then called, was a new thing among us Indi-anians, for hoosier was then
                    unknown among us, as it should be so still. The person and endowments of the preacher were also
                    causes of attracting attention. Although thirty-nine years have rolled away since, I still have a
                    vivid recollection of the man, and his manner then. He was a tall, slender young man, in the prime
                    and vigor of his life. His hair, which was inclined to be fair, was clipped short from the forehead
                    about half way to the crown, and the remainder turned back, and suffered to grow eight or ten inches
                    long, so as to reach down to the shoulders, about which it hung loosely and gracefully. His voice
                    was stentorian, forming a full bass, but nothing in it harsh or grating to the nerves of the
                    hearers, and having a great command of words, he poured forth his thoughts and feelings with great
                    volubility and zeal; and being prayerful and pious, the Lord owned and blessed his labors. Although
                    I was not religious at the time, and not even inclined that way, yet the voice and manner of the man
                    greatly excited my emotions, but in no degree operated on my moral feelings. <pb n="25" id="VAA4025-023-1-031"/> I well remember his last sermon in our neighborhood, delivered from a
                    stand in the wods. He chose for his text, the words of Abraham's servant, to Rebecca and
                    her friends, "If ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me, and if not, tell
                    me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left." This brother still lives, and
                    retains, in a great measure his bodily strength, and his wonderful voice, and yet preaches with zeal
                    and energy. 0, that his sun may decline in smiles, and bring a pleasing night.</p>

            <p>One of the prominent instruments of the planting, spread, and symmetry of Methodism in this part of
                    the land was Elijah Sparks. He was born in Queen Ann's county, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, about 1770. Of his parentage and early training I know nothing. At the age of nineteen
                    or twenty he became a professor of religion; and in 1792 became a traveling preacher. There is great
                    confusion in the bound <hi rend="i">Minutes</hi> in reference to his case. It is stated in 1792,
                    that he remains on trial; but there is no account of his reception, or of any appointment for him
                    the preceding year. In 1793 he is said to remain on trial; but there is no mention of his name in
                    connection with any field of labor; he did travel, however, as his widow informed me not long since.
                    The first year he is put down for Rockingham circuit. As I supposed the <hi rend="i">Minutes</hi>
                    would give me all the information I wanted, I did not inquire of Sister Sparks about his second
                    circuit, so that I must leave it blank. In the course of this year, 1793, he married Miss Elizabeth
                    Weaver, which was in that day, equivalent to desisting from traveling; for the opinion prevailed
                    generally with preachers and people, that no young man ought to marry and remain a traveling
                    preacher; and if this had not been the opinion, the means of support were so very limited, that
                    necessity would have driven such to desist from the work. Whether the opinion of that day, which
                    will tolerate a ministerial boy without a beard, to <pb n="26" id="VAA4025-023-1-032"/> marry the
                    first or second year of his traveling, without much, if any, loss of ministerial standing, is the
                    correct opinion, who shall determine? I believe they are both wrong, and that the truth is between
                    the extremes. He, however, was in his twenty-third year. What his success was as a traveling
                    preacher, I have no means of knowing.</p>
            <p>After he ceased to travel, he went into mercantile operations; with what success I know not; but I
                    presume not very great, as his circumstances were moderate when he moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1806. In 1798, he moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> with some law books, and commenced the study of law; and in the fall of 1800, he
                    commenced practice in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Campbell county</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. How successful he was, I have not
                    learned; but from his known talents, it is presumed his succes was encouraging. In 1806, he settled
                    contiguous to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and commenced the legal profession in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName> and adjacent counties, in the then Indiana territory, which he pursued for a number of
                    years with much popularity and success. In 1814, he was appointed circuit judge for the Third
                    circuit in the Indiana territory, which office he held with great credit until his death in 1815.
                    Frequently were his decisions afterward quoted as good authority.</p>
            <p>When Brother Sparks settled in Indiana, he was in rather a lanquid state of religious enjoyment; and
                    had formed the opinion that ministers need not excite the passions of their hearers; but simply
                    present truth and the reasonableness of Christianity to the understandings and judgments of men, and
                    they would become religious: hence, his sermons were wholly argumentative from beginning to end. How
                    a man of his sense could lose sight of man's constitution, which embraces a world of
                    passion, and regard him as wholly intellectual, is hard to conceive; and how a man of his ardent
                    temperament could preach in his purely argumentative manner, is still more difficult of
                    comprehension. His case will prove the wonderful influence which a man's theory will have
                    on him, and should admonish us to examine our theories well, that we may not be injured by those
                    which are erroneous. He pursued this course of preaching for some years; but <pb n="27" id="VAA4025-023-1-033"/> it is presumed he had not one seal to his ministry during the time he
                    continued thus to preach. I think it was the first year Walter Griffith was on Enon (afterward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>) circuit, Brother Sparks became greatly revived in his religious feelings, and excited
                    to zeal in preaching. He, however, had been on the increase in piety and zeal for sometime before,
                    in a gradual way. But after this time, wonderful was the change in the man and the effects of his
                    preaching. Now he could reason as lucidly as ever, but his reasoning was mixed with the most
                    powerful appeals to the conscience, and the most powerful addresses to the passions; and great was
                    his success in winning souls to God, and in establishing them in truth.</p>
            <p>As a preacher, I am at a loss for language to portray the man, the minister. At that day, on account
                    of the popular prejudice against lawyers it was very hard to make the multitude believe that a
                    lawyer could be even a Christian; but for such to be a Gospel minister was deemed the height of
                    absurdity, if not downright profanity. With all this popular prejudice against him, the intellectual
                    and moral worth of this man of God gave him the most extended popularity, as a minister, of any in
                    the circle of his influence. At a camp meeting, let a man arise a little above the medium height,
                    rather slender, with a dark skin, and most piercing black eyes, and a head rather prematurely gray,
                    immediately in the inner circle of the congregation, the whisper would go round it is Brother
                    Sparks, and in the outer circle the same remark would be made, with the substitution of Mr. for
                    brother. Immediately all placed themselves in the best possible attitude to hear, and so remained
                    unless the performance drew the whole multitude unconsciously to their feet in a crowded mass, as
                    close as they could get around the stand. If his subject were doctrinal, you might hear the being,
                    attributes, and government of God, the atonement of Christ, and the influences of the Holy Spirit in
                    the sinner's awakening and regeneration, presented with a sublimity of thought, a dignity
                    and simplicity of style, and a pathos, which enchained his attentive audience. If his subject were
                    experimental <pb n="28" id="VAA4025-023-1-034"/> religion, you would hear a lively description of
                    the various exercises of the human heart, under a deep conviction of man's depravity and
                    condemnation as a guilty sinner before God; the contrition and deep mourning which succeed such
                    conviction, the struggles and despondencies, which alternately encourage and depress the soul, until
                    by a simple act of faith in the merits of Christ, and the truth of the divine promises, the sinner
                    ventures his all upon God, and is pardoned and regenerated; the earnest hungering and thirsting of
                    the new-born soul for that full measure of righteousness, which will fully renew the man in the
                    whole image of God. If the subject were of a practical kind the multiform duties of men, in all the
                    relations of life were presented with a lucid detail, and with such an accumulation of motive to
                    duty, that every one felt as if he would never relax in its performance, but to the utmost of his
                    power he would abound in every good work.</p>
            <p>The readiness with which he could command his thoughts and feelings was wonderful. After having spent
                    the whole day in the most important and intricate cases in court, in addressing the court on
                    questions of law, and juries on questions of law and facts, with the most accurate details, in
                    summing up the multifarious statements of numerous witnesses, he would say to some friends toward
                    evening, if you will give the people word, I will preach to them to-night. Soon there would be a
                    rush to the school-house, or court-house, (for churches we had none) and he would preach to them,
                    with as much clearness and zeal, as if he had spent the whole day in his study and closet, in deep
                    thought and prayer for God's blessing.</p>
            <p>I know not that he ever published more than one of his sermons, and that one was on the atonement,
                    which was much mooted by the followers of Marshall and Stone, commonly called
                    "Newlights", who were much inclined to the errors of Arius. The sermon is now very
                    scarce, only a few brethren retaining it as a memento of the preacher. He gave several of his
                    brethren manuscript sermons in a condensed form.</p>
            <pb n="29" id="VAA4025-023-1-035"/>
            <p>As a husband and a father he was most effectionate and kind, and did all that his means and
                    opportunities permitted to make them wise, pious, and happy: hence, his family felt his loss in no
                    ordinary degree. As a Christian, after the renewing of his religious feelings, (which I before
                    mentioned) his experience in the things of God was deep, abiding, onward to the last. As a friend to
                    the traveling and local preachers there were few equal, and none superior. With all his varied
                    treasures of knowledge, he was condescending and kind. There was nothing magisterial about him; but
                    in the most mild and modest manner, he would impart to the ignorant that instruction which they
                    needed in such a prudent manner, that there was no painfully mortifying sense of inferiority on the
                    part of the instructed, but all that ease which an affectionate son would feel in receiving
                    instruction from a tender father. The varied circumstances in life in which he had been placed and
                    the diversity of experience through which he had passed, prepared him to sympathize with his
                    brethren in all their diversified states of sorrow and joy. The preachers who had the privilege of
                    being acquainted with him will bless God forever, for that providence which granted them such a
                    privilege; and these preachers were not few in number; for his attendance on many courts and at many
                    popular meetings brought him into acquaintance with many of them.</p>
            <p>Having a large family to provide for, and being somewhat advanced in life when he commenced his
                    professional career, he never advanced in temporalities beyond a present competency, or he would
                    doubtless have given the church and the public his whole time and talents. Shortly before his death,
                    a relative of his wife left her eight or ten thousand dollars, which would have made him and his
                    family easy and comfortable in their circumstances. In the spring of 1815, he went east to attend to
                    this legacy, and to visit his brother Robert, a traveling preacher of many years standing in the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, he started to his brother's, and went as far as the heart of the Elk, when he
                    became sick <pb n="30" id="VAA4025-023-1-036"/> and confined, and after lingering a few days,
                    expired far from home and wife and friends. Among the last things which he did a few hours before
                    his death, was the writing of an affectionate letter to his wife, (partly of a business character)
                    which he commenced by saying, "Before this reaches you, I shall be in eternity",
                    and he continued to write until the writing was hardly legible.</p>

                    </placeName>! Here is a man superior in piety, gifts, and usefulness, intending to adjust his
                    temporalities so as to devote the evening of his days wholly to the interests of religion and
                    God's glory; but just when everything seemed to say, he may go abroad in the vineyard of
                    the Lord, death overtakes him far from home, his family, and friends. While one of his children lies
                    dead, and the burial is delayed, so that he might see the body of his beloved child before it is
                    consigned to the grave, he being expected home every minute, a letter arrives informing his wife and
                    children, that her husband and their father is no more an inhabitant of this world, and letting the
                    church know that her most zealous champion is no longer on her walls, to repel her foes, and
                    encourage her in the ways of truth, and holiness, and usefulness.</p>
            <p>He died when we did not expect it, and the whole country, embracing the pious and the wicked, seemed
                    astounded, that a man so talented and useful should be taken away from us, when his body was yet
                    vigorous and his mind yet capable of much more expansion. Notwithstanding he died in his palmy days,
                    his spirit, and influence, and usefulness, did not die with him; but still live in the noble
                    structure of Methodism, which he helped to found and build up in this country.</p>

            <p>My fourth number gives the state of Methodism on White Water circuit in the autumn of 1806, when
                    Joseph Oglesby, who formed the circuit, went to conference at Ebenezer, Nol-lechuckie, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>. Next year the circuit (doubtless through mistake) is called <geogName>White

                    SeIa Paine were appointed to it. If Paine ever came to the circuit, I have no knowledge of the fact;
                    for I have no remembrance of the man, though from the <hi rend="i">Minutes</hi> I find he traveled
                    nine years as a probationer and member of the Western and <placeName>

                    </placeName> conferences. I well remember the person and preaching of Thomas Hellums, who was a most
                    grave, zealous, affectionate, and weeping preacher.</p>
            <p>How many new preaching places were occupied this year, I know not, but doubtless there were several.
                    Brother Hugh Cull, a local preacher of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName>, thinks that it was this year, under the labors of Hellums, that the society was
                    permanently established in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> settlement. Brother Cull says he went to Four Mile creek in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to mill, and met the preacher, and conducted him through the wilderness to his house
                    and neighborhood, and he formed a class and appointed Hugh Cull leader. In the spring of this year,
                    1807, Charles Waddle, and two or three other families, settled in the eastern part of what is now <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Union county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and formed themselves into a class; but I think Brother Waddle <pb n="32" id="VAA4025-023-1-038"/> told me, they had no preaching until Joseph Williams came on in the
                    fall. From the <hi rend="i">Minutes</hi>, I find there was an increase of ninety-eight whites and
                    one colored under the labors of Hellums.</p>
            <p>I have no distinct recollection of any of the quarterly meetings while Oglesby and Hellums were on
                    the circuit. I remember once being at a meeting, (and it was probably a quarterly meeting) in the
                    grove of sycamore trees, which then stood in the low bottom, near the residence of Thomas Williams,
                    about a mile and a half above where Elizabethtown now is. This meeting was superintended by John
                    Sale, the presiding elder, and it does seem to me that is was in Ogles-by's time; but of
                    this I cannot be certain. I well remember, Sale gave the congregation distinct notice, that if any
                    person misbehaved, he would expose and sharply reprove such; but such was our respect for ourselves,
                    that there was no occasion to expose or reprove us. I would be glad if we could always say the same
                    of modern congregations, in these days of supposed refinement. I have no distinct recollection of
                    any of the preaching, except one sermon of considerable ability, preached by the Rev. William Lines,
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to prove the depravity of human nature. Perhaps I remember that sermon more
                    particularly, in consequence of the peculiar English pronunciation of the preacher, as such
                    pronunciation was then new to me. As an example the preacher quoting Isaiah i, 6, said, sole of the
                    futt for foot. The sermon was strongly Antipelagian, and well calculated to convince that
                    congregation, that man was fallen, and deeply depraved and guilty before God, and much needed pardon
                    and regeneration.</p>
            <p>The doctrines and usages of Methodism now began to be some better understood and appreciated by the
                    observing friends of the church; but there was still a strange misapprehension of these things by
                    the professors of religion of other denominations. I will relate the substance of a conversation
                    which took place several years subsequent to this time, to show how slowly the Methodists were
                    understood in their doctrinal views. Myself and another were conversing about the <hi rend="i">Arminian Magazine</hi>, and especially about the strong doctrine <pb n="33" id="VAA4025-023-1-039"/> of free grace which pervade the pages of that publication, when a
                    stranger, who was present, and who seemed to be an amiable and somewhat intelligent member of the
                    Baptist church, appeared surprised that we should talk about the doctrines of grace as connected
                    with Arminianism, and told US, with candor, that he had always understood the term Ar-minian to
                    mean, one who trusted in an arm of flesh for salvation. Sometimes the Methodists were reviled in
                    public companies.</p>
            <p>I remember, once in the harvest field about those times, a young man was reviling these people, when
                    a brother, John Brison, who was then and still is a worthy member of the church, mildly admonished
                    the young man; he seemed to start up with fury, and wished to enter into a doctrinal discussion, and
                    with much pertness and great spleen, asked Brison, if he believed a Christian could fall from grace?
                    Brison mildly replied, when you obtain grace I will talk with you on that subject. This mild answer
                    completely confounded the pert young man. Although I had no religion, and at that time was not
                    partial to the usages and view of the Methodists, yet I thought the young man had been treated most
                    discreetly by the brother. Often were the views of these people misrepresented, even by godly
                    ministers, who were wholly unacqainted with their doctrinal opinions. They were supposed to deny the
                    entire depravity of the human heart—the utter helplessness and lost estate of man, and to
                    believe that they could work themselves into the favor of God, and by their own works merit heaven.
                    To those who live in the present day it may seem strange, passing strange, that their views were so
                    entirely mistaken; but I state sober facts as they were. It is not to be wondered at, that good and
                    religious men opposed them, as the opinion was current, that should their doctrines prevail, the
                    cause of true religion would sustain great injury. If their opponents were to blame, it was not for
                    using the means which were accessible to ascertain their true sentiments, before a crusade was
                    commenced against them. One of the consequences of this opposition was to make their preaching
                    controversial in its general aspect, which was not <pb n="34" id="VAA4025-023-1-040"/> calculated to
                    conciliate, but to keep them and their opposers in antagonistic attitudes. Foster, in his
                    description of an English Methodist, says, among other things, "A Methodist finds himself
                    in a pushing world, and he is disposed to push with the foremost." This dispostion to push
                    was forced on these people by their opposers; and it remained with them until they gained their
                    present standing; and they now pursue the even tenor of their way, and seldom think of preaching a
                    controversial sermon, unless it be to expose those glaringly heterodox views which are destructive
                    of all genuine religion, both in form and power. They now find themselves acknowledged as orthodox
                    Christians by other orthodox churches of the land; and it is to be hoped that the present state of
                    fraternal feeling will be perpetuated.</p>
            <p>I will finish the present number with a brief notice of the second traveling preacher on the White
                    Water circuit. The time and place of Thomas Hellum's birth, and his early training, are
                    wholly unknown to the writer. The first notice which I find of him is in the fall of 1805, when he
                    was received on trial by the Western conference and appointed to <geogName>Red River</geogName>
                    circuit, in the Cumberland district, with William M'Kendree, afterward Bishop
                    M'Kendree, for his presiding elder. I presume he, as any other young man would, esteemed it
                    a kind <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> to be placed under the charge of a man so intellectual and pious, and discreet, as was
                    his elder. Perhaps there are few young men fully prepared, at the time, to form a just estimate of
                    the advantage of the right kind of an elder in the early part of their itinerant life; but in future
                    years they will consider this matter aright. His second appointment, in 1806, was to White Water
                    circuit, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> district, under the supervision of John Sale, another excellent elder, who endeavored
                    to train all his young men to industry and system in all they did. His third appointment, in 1807,
                    was to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Shelby</region>
                    </placeName> circuit, <placeName>

                    </placeName> district, under the charge of William Burke, who was then in his best days of bodily
                    and mental vigor. His fourth appointment, in 1808, was to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Natchez</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
               </placeName>,
                    district, John M'Clure, presiding elder. His fifth field of labor, in 1809, was <placeName>

                    presiding elder. Blackman was a man of superior talents for popularity and usefulness. He was

                    was lister of the taxable property for a part or the whole of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin county</region>
                    </placeName>, in the spring of 1814. With whom he read law, I have not been able to learn. The next
                    that I heard anything particularly about him was, in the summer of 1817 when he lived at Port
                    William, now Carrolton, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, where he was very useful in a glorious revival in that town and vicinity. Whether he
                    had then entered on the practice of law, or not, I cannot say. Afterward I heard of him as a
                    practicing lawyer in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. If my memory be correct, Brother David Sharp, now of the Pittsburg conference, the
                    presiding elder of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> district, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> conference, was my informant, who told me that his refined and delicate feelings
                    unfitted him for many of the rough and vulgar cases which he had to manage in that new country, so
                    that he was quite an unhappy man. The next information which I had of him was, at a meeting on
                    either the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName>, or <geogName>Red River</geogName>, when there were some slight symptoms of mental
                    alienation. He started to go to some place, not now recollected, and was never heard of afterward.</p>
            <p>He was a tall, raw-boned, hollowed-eyed man, who dresesd according to the Methodist preacher fashion
                    of that day, namely round-breasted coat, long vest with the corners cut off, short breaches, and
                    long stockings, with his hair turned back, from about midway between the forehead and the crown, and
                    permitted to grow down to the shoulders. He had a most solemn and impressive countenance, and his
                    subjects of discourse were usually of a grave and pathetic cast; and they were rendered much more
                    pathetic by his manner of delivering them. The intonations of his voice were as solemn as death, and
                    usually the large tears dropped from his face most most of the time while he was preaching. So far
                    as I can <pb n="36" id="VAA4025-023-1-042"/> judge, his piety was deep and abiding, and his talents
                    I should think were above mediocrity. He was a useful man in his ministerial labors, and had he
                    possessed good health, so that he could have continued in the regular work, he doubtless would have
                    become very eminent; but his health was very poor all the eight years of his itinerant life. Such
                    was the tenderness of his feelings, and such the independence of his spirit, that he was unwilling
                    to receive a superannuated relation and lean on the conference for support; consequently when he was
                    unable to do the full work of a traveling preacher, he located and turned his attention to a secular
                    calling, which, although honorable and lucrative, was not congenial to a man of his peculiar
                    delicacy, hence a kind <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> removed him from the evil to come, and, I trust, safely housed him in heaven. His bones
                    may be bleaching in the dense forest, or on the open plain, or covered by the river's sand;
                    but that God, who looks down and watches all the dust of his servants, till he shall bid it rise,
                    will in due time gather up these bones, and rebuild a glorious house with them, fitted for his
                    glorified spirit.</p>
            <p>I never had but one interview with him after I became religious, and that was in my own cabin, and at
                    my own table, in the eastern part of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin county</region>
                    </placeName>, when he was lister; yet I love to think about him as the pious minister who used to
                    preach to me, an unconverted boy, but who was as innocent and happy as an unconverted and
                    irreligious boy could well be. Should my soul be numbered with the blessed, I hope to enjoy the
                    society of Thomas Hellums, that pious, grave, sweet-spirited man of God.</p>
            <p>I would be glad if I had the materials to present a better, a more full drawn portrait of that meek,
                    but somewhat pensive man, who passed through many tribulations to the land of sweet rest. Little did
                    I think thirty-nine years ago, when he came to this county, that this poor hand would try to rescue
                    his memory from oblivion. "The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance."</p>

            <p>Since writing the last number, I remember a two days, or quarterly meeting, I know not which, held at
                    Mr. M'Carty's in the latter part of 1806, or the beginning of 1807, which was
                    attended by Benjamin Lakin, who preached very impressively. On Sabbath, he was preaching with great
                    earnestness, when he suddenly paused, and said, in a most solemn manner, "I feel an
                    impression that there is some young man, or young woman, in this house, who will be tramping in hell
                    before this time next year." As sudden as thought, all the young persons whom I could see
                    became deathly pale; and I suppose myself among the rest; for although I could not see myself, I
                    know I felt as awful as death, judgment, and eternity, could make me. For several weeks, the
                    attenuated thread of human life, and of my own life in particular, appeared ready to sunder almost
                    every moment. I could see dangers standing thick through all the ground, to hurry me to the tomb. My
                    feelings were dreadful; but as I had no love for God, or holiness, or religion, I kept them to
                    myself, and did what I could to resist the feelings, and finally succeeded. I have never seen the
                    venerable preacher since that day; but doubtless his labors, at that interesting meeting, were owned
                    by God, and will be had in remembrance in the day of eternity; for there must have been seals to his
                    ministry; but my soul was not of the number. 0, that it had been; for it would have saved me from
                    much sin.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1807, Joseph Williams was sent to White Water circuit in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> district, John Sale still presiding elder. The country between the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> on the east and the Indian land on the west, had now considerably filled up with many
                    new settlers, so that many new neighbors were taken in as preaching places, and the number of
                    appointments was now largely over twenty, and Hugh Cull, before named, was employed to assist
                    Williams in the work. He was not a strong preacher, but he had a most useful talent for exhortation,
                    which he used to great advantage in his Master's cause. He had a most burning zeal against
                    all sorts of sin, which he <pb n="38" id="VAA4025-023-1-044"/> used to depict in its most horrid
                    aspects; and then most pathetically exhort sinners to flee from it, and turn to God, and seek
                    salvation; and great was his success. Hugh Cull, or Hugh O'Cull, as his name was
                    originally, could exhort most feelingly, and weep showers of tears all the time; so that he made
                    powerful impressions on the people in this new country, where they had not much able preaching.</p>
            <p>The reader must be aware, from the description of these men, that, with Heaven's blessing,
                    they must have a revival; and so it was; for the membership was more than doubled, being increased
                    from one hundred and sixty-six to three hundred and fifty-two. I have been hoping that Brother
                    Williams would furnish me with some valuable information concerning that year's work; but
                    he has not done so; and I have to do as well as I can from my own recollections. Sometime in the
                    winter of this year, I attended another popular meeting at Mr. M'Carty's, when
                    they had a great excitment on Sabbath, particularly after preaching. Some were weeping with bitter
                    grief, and some were leaping and shouting with triumphant joy. Never shall I forget my feelings on
                    that day. All these exercises seemed to me as the veriest enthusiasm and wildfire that could be.
                    This meeting was a few weeks before my marriage; and she who is now my wife was in attendance, and
                    stood in another part of the house just beyond the persons who were exercised as before described. I
                    looked at her, and thought within myself, I would not see you in that way for all this world. Little
                    did I think that in a few years, my anxiety to see her religiously impressed would be as strong as
                    my aversion was then.</p>
            <p>My personal knowledge of the doings and progress of the Methodists, after the middle of the winter of
                    1808, was less for about one year, than it was before and after that time. After my marriage, I went
                    but seldom to Methodist meetings, as the Baptists had meeting much nearer my residence and I and my
                    wife attended their ministry for sometime; consequently necessity will compel me to give a more
                    meagre account of this interesting year than any other. Should Brother <pb n="39" id="VAA4025-023-1-045"/> Williams, or any other person, furnish me any useful information, 1
                    will try to interweave it into some future number.</p>
            <p>According to the <hi rend="i">Minutes</hi>, in the fall of 1808, William Houston and John Sinclair
                    were appointed to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> circuit, in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> district, with John Sale on it, and Hector Sandford and Moses Crume to the White Water
                    circuit, in the Indiana district, with Samuel Parker on it. I infer, however, that the bishop
                    himself made a change shortly after conference, or permitted the presiding elders to do it, as Crume
                    did not travel White Water that year, but Sinclair did. Sandford remained on the circuit until near
                    the close of winter when he left it and Hezekiah Shaw came on in his place, much to the
                    disappointment and grief of the people; for Sandford was one of the most popular and successful
                    preachers of his day in this section of the country. His zeal and success spread his fame abroad, so
                    that whenever he preached the people flocked out to hear him in crowds, and many were his seals in
                    almost all parts of the circuit, from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName> down nearly to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland county</region>
                    </placeName>, although <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland county</region>
                    </placeName> was not then organized, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> did not then exist. I am not positive, however, that Sandford went so far down; but
                    Sinclair preached at a brother Demare's within less than three miles of the site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the course of the year. A brother, near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, told me not long since, that the first Methodist preaching which he heard in this
                    neighborhood was by Sandford, at a school-house near the East Fork Forks. This preaching was
                    sometime before there was any <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> thought of. The brother said, all the people about the Forks went to hear him, and
                    great was the shaking among them. I never heard Sandford except once, and then he was sick, and did
                    not succeed very well. Many of his converts are still living in different parts of the state, and
                    are worthy members of the church to this day.</p>
            <p>Sandford was admitted on trial into the Western conference in the fall of 1810, so that he only
                    traveled four years. He settled in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chillicothe</settlement>
                    </placeName> and went into business extensively; but with what success I am not informed. The last I
                    heard of him, if I remember aright, he was among the Protestant <pb n="40" id="VAA4025-023-1-046"/>
                    Methodists. It appears to me a great pity, that a man so useful should ever locate, or waiver in his
                    mind or aberrate in his course.</p>
            <p>Sinclair was a modest, diffident man, of feeble health who desisted from traveling at the end of the
                    year, and after remaining in this country sometime, went south for the benefit of his health, and
                    what became of him is unknown to me. While he remained in these parts, his meek spirit and devout
                    life did much good in the families where he staid, and the people loved to have him about their
                    houses, and to hear him preach, although he was a feeble preacher.</p>
            <p>Hezekiah Shaw was admitted the same fall that Sandford was. He had only traveled something over two
                    years, when he came to the White Water circuit, and had been in charge of a circuit only a few
                    months. He was not a very strong preacher, and was rather wanting in zeal, and so great was the
                    contrast between him and his predecessor, that the people were not prepared to estimate him at his
                    real worth, or to treat him with that kindness and respect which he deserved. Hence, his condition
                    was rather unpleasant. I have always supposed Shaw was a well meaning little man, but wanting in
                    judgment After traveling a few years, he returned to the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> country, and married, and became a local preacher; and what has finally become of him I
                    know not.</p>
            <p>This year witnessed the first camp meeting which was ever held in the White Water country. The
                    meeting was near where the canal now is, a little below the Lower Narrows, or about five miles above <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison</region>
                    </placeName>. This meeting was superintended by Shaw, who injudiciously put up written
                    advertisements in different parts of the countqy, threatening the people with three dollars fine for
                    sundry breaches of order, to be assessed by a worthy justice in the vicinity, by the name of Adair.
                    These written threats made many of the people go to the meeting with feelings of insubordination. I
                    know this was the case with myself, notwithstanding I had been a praying man for some time. Brother
                    Robert Breckenridge, now of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who was apparently a very grave man, but was really a humorous and witty sinner, got
                    hold of one <pb n="41" id="VAA4025-023-1-047"/> of these advertisements, and paraphrased it in a
                    poetic effusion, every stanza of which ended with the words, "three dollars fine".
                    One of the preachers on his way to the camp meeting got hold of the piece of poetry (for it too was
                    stuck up against a tree) and it afforded the clergy some amusement at Shaw's expense. With
                    all the bad feeling beforehand, the meeting passed off finely, and much good was done; for a goodly
                    number were converted, and some joined the church. I do not remember now what preachers were present
                    except a few.</p>
            <p>Among the most prominent, was William Houston, then of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> circuit, now of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> conference. I first knew <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Houston</settlement>
                    </placeName> of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> as a school-teacher, from whom I received a part of my early education. He began to
                    exhort or preach in the summer of 1804, and commenced traveling in the fall. He was now a preacher
                    of nearly five years' standing. Throughout the meeting, he preached in the afternoon, and
                    the people who did not camp would wait to hear him preach; and I know not that I ever knew a
                    preacher who would interest an audience more than he did; and it was some gratification to me to
                    find my former teacher so good a preacher and so popular, and withal so successful in winning souls.</p>
            <p>There were some circumstances of interest connected with this meeting. A man of learning, by the name
                    of Mervin, whose prepossessions were in favor of the Presbyterian church, and who lived near where <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Houston</settlement>
                    </placeName> preached about the whole armor of God, the word reached his heart, and he became much
                    excited. He went home in the evening, and went to bed, still thinking and feeling about his
                    soul's salvation. All at once, light broke into his mind, and love flowed into his heart,
                    and he felt as if in a new world. He began to shout aloud, and spent most of the night in rejoicing
                    in God, his Savior. He spent some months in making up his mind what church to join, and finally
                    became a Methodist, and remained steadfast for sometime in the doctrines and usages of the church of
                    his own choice; but as his first love declined he wavered and finally <pb n="42" id="VAA4025-023-1-048"/> withdrew, and joined the church of his early preferences. He has been
                    dead some years, and I trust safely landed in a world of rest. Another, honest soul went forward to
                    join, and being asked by the preacher, whether he was willing to renounce the devil and the world,
                    answered in the simplicity of his heart, "I am willing to do anything you tell
                    me."</p>
            <p>It was at this meeting where the writer of these numbers first went forward publicly to the altar of
                    prayer on Sunday night, to have the benefits of the prayers of the church and the instructions
                    usually given by the ministers on these occasions; but he did not then experience regenerating
                    grace.</p>
            <p>I suppose about these times the Gospel began to be preached and societies to be formed by Methodist
                    preachers, about the Hogans and other parts below <placeName>

                    numbered four hundred and eighty-four, being an increase of one hundred and thirty-two, so that the
                    course of Methodism was still onward.</p>

            <p>In the autumn of 1809, according to the <hi rend="i">Minutes</hi>, Solomon Langdon and Moses Crume
                    were appointed to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> circuit, and Thomas Nelson and Samuel H. Thompson to the White Water circuit, with John
                    Sale for presiding elder, both circuits being now in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> district. Nelson and Thompson had both just been received on trial by the Western
                    conference. I never saw Nelson, as he remained but a short time on the circuit until he was removed,
                    and Crume came on in his place. Crume had occasionally visited the White Water country at popular
                    meetings, as he lived on Cotton Run, in that part of the circuit which borders on the Great
                        <geogName>Miami river</geogName>; but he had not before traveled regularly in this region. Early
                    in this year, I became acquainted with him and attached to him. Our acquaintance commenced in the
                    following way: He had preached at Mr. Manwarring's, whose house was the regular preaching
                    place for our vicinity, and after preaching <pb n="43" id="VAA4025-023-1-049"/> wanted to go
                    somewhere on the upper waters of Dry Fork, a tributary of White Water, but was unacquainted with the
                    nearest way, it being only a pathway. I volunteered to pilot him about seven miles on his way.
                    During our travel, we had much grave conversation on the subject of religion. At parting, I proposed
                    to purchase the small <hi rend="i">Scriptural Catechism</hi> published by the churcli, and which he
                    carried for sale. He, however, declined selling, but gave me one; and this very small book laid the
                    foundation of my present theological knowledge.</p>
            <p>The White Water circuit then went as far north, I think, as Eaton in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and above where the National Road now runs through <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, down to Loglick and Indian creeks in the present county of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>, and included all the country between a line from the mouth of the <geogName>Kentucky
                        river</geogName> to Fort Recovery, and the Great <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName>. There are now about fifteen circuits and stations in the Indiana part of the circuit,
                    and several in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> part. This field of labor, Crume and Thompson traveled every four weeks. This was a
                    year of prosperity on the circuit. Crume was not a zealous energetic preacher but he was a good
                    pastor, and kind nurse of young converts. Thompson was young, and zealous, and powerful in winning
                    souls. Sometimes, however, he would doubt his call to the ministry, and even his conversion to God,
                    and then he was gloomy and discouraged, and had but little energy. In numerous parts of the circuit
                    there were good revivals of religion, and the membership increased from four hundred and eighty-four
                    to six hundred and thirty-two, being an increase of one hundred and fifty-four. Crume and Thompson
                    are both gone, so that minute information concerning the work in that year cannot now be had. Very
                    seldom did two men labor together in more harmony than did Crume and Thompson, the one as a father,
                    the other as a son. If I had room in this number, I would be glad to portray Sale, Langdon, Crume,
                    and Thompson, who are all dead; but I must reserve this to a future occasion.</p>
            <p>This was a year of great importance to the writer of these numbers. In the latter part of December,
                    1808, his father-in-law died, and two of his sons, who were professors of religion, <pb n="44" id="VAA4025-023-1-050"/> visited their mother and the remainder of the family. During their
                    stay, one of them attended family prayer with much gravity and devotion. This example so impressed
                    the mind of the writer, that he resolved to become religious, and he began to read the Bible; and
                    after returning home with his wife and child he attempted family prayer, which was the first time he
                    ever kneeled down to pray in all his life. He continued this course for some months, with much
                    increased desire for salvation; but his desire fluctuated, as he endeavored to travel alone in this
                    new way. From the teaching which he had received, mostIy from the Baptists, he though it wrong to
                    join any church until he had an experience of a gracious work in his heart. His predilections had
                    been to the Baptist church but now his mind wavered. While unconcerned about religion, he had been a
                    confirmed fatalist; but when made to feel the full force of moral obligation and a deep conviction
                    for sin, he could no longer believe fatality, or even unconditional election and reprobation. While
                    in this dreadful state of indecision and suspense he had well nigh ceased to pray, except
                    occasionally. Just at this critical juncture, his acquaintance commenced with Crume, who told him
                    that neglect of duty was the cause of his mind being so harassed and perplexed. He now commenced
                    with more earnestness than ever to seek the Lord; but still it was in great darkness and feebleness.
                    He had none of his friends to counsel and encourage him, for none of them were religious, except the
                    two brothers-in-law before mentioned, and they were living a hundrd miles distant. He at length
                    borrowed a Methodist <hi rend="i">Discipline</hi>, which had the explanatory notes of Coke and
                    Asbury. This he read with great care and found some fault with a few things in it, and stated his
                    objections to Crume, who, by mild statements and reasons, removed them, and he finally concluded to
                    join the Methodist Episcopal Church which he did with much fear and trembling, on the eighteenth of
                    April, one thousand eight hundred and ten, in the twenty-second year of his age. After much mental
                    exercise on the subject of baptism he became satisfied that infant baptism was proper, and
                    sprinkling, or pouring, a valid mode; and he and his two oldest children were <pb n="45" id="VAA4025-023-1-051"/> baptized by Moses Crume, by pouring, about one year after he had joined
                    the church.</p>
            <p>When he joined the Methodists, he well knew that this course would subject him to much reproach,
                    which, however, was the very thing he needed, as it cut him off from the world, and brought him in
                    closer intercourse with the people of God. Sometime in the summer after he joined the church, at a
                    love feast, under the concluding prayer, he trusts, God forgave his sins, and made him measurably a
                    new creature; but he did not receive that bright and strong evidence of his gracious state that many
                    do; but his assurance was a gradual work, and continues to increase to the present day. When he
                    travels from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> down to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison</region>
                    </placeName> or elsewhere, and sees the old house yet standing, in which he was blessed of God, he
                    feels mournful, yet glad—mournful to see the old house decaying, but glad that the Lord
                    converted him in it. It is the same house in which Moses Crume received him in church more than
                    thirty-five years ago, and where, he trusts, his name was registered in the Lamb's book of
                    life.</p>
            <p>Shortly after this change, he began to feel impressions that he would be called to preach. Strange as
                    it may seem, even when he was wicked, the thought would flit through his mind occasionally, that he
                    would be a preacher, and he would sometimes say so to his friends, not that he had any desire for
                    such an event. In the fall of 1811, just before Crume left the circuit (for he was two years on it),
                    he gave the writer a written permit to exhort (for Crume and the people were persuaded he would be a
                    preacher), and this permit, or license, was renewed the next year by the quarterly meeting
                    conference, and in July, 1813, he was licensed to preach. So far as he knows, he was the first
                    person who was both converted and licensed to preach in Indiana. There may have been some converted
                    and licensed in Clark's grant, or about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, before him, but if so, he does not know it, and would be glad to know.</p>
            <p>When he joined the church, there was one whole circuit in Indiana called Silver Creek, in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Grant</region>
                    </placeName>. One about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which, he supposes, was partly in Indiana and partly <pb n="46" id="VAA4025-023-1-052"/> in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and one called White Water, partly in Indiana and partly in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The membership in Indiana could not have been more than eight or nine hundred; and the
                    whole membership in <placeName>
                        <country>America</country>
                    </placeName>, not more than one hundred and eighty thousand.</p>
            <p>The writer hopes the reader will pardon this small amount of personal history. Indeed, he told him in
                    the beginning, that the very nature of the case would require him to present himself more
                    prominently before the public than is desirable.</p>
            <p>There were two interesting camp meetings on the circuit this year (1810), the one in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> settlement, in the present county of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, and the other in the Big Bottom, about one-half mile, or a little more, from where
                    Elizabeth-town now is, on the land of old Brother Scoggin. I was not at the one in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> settlement, and can say nothing from personal knowledge; but all my information went to
                    say, it was a most glorious meeting for the church and the cause of God in that part of the work.
                    Many sinners were converted and many Christians made unspeakably happy, and doubtless some of them
                    filled with perfect love. There was, however, one melancholy case after this meeting. A good sister,
                    the wife of a local preacher by the name of Jeremiah Meek, became ecstatic in her feelings, perhaps
                    little inferior to the ecstacy of heaven. She continued in this state about three weeks, day and
                    night, in which time she scarcely ate, drank, or slept any. This state, however, was too much for a
                    mortal body with brain and nerves; for it was found when her ecstasy began to subside, her mind was
                    unbalanced, and she became a maniac, and so remained for many years. I became acquainted with her
                    nine or ten years afterward, when she had, in some measure, recovered her reason, but not her former
                    religious enjoyment. Her mind was gloomy, and her countenance sad, and still bearing the marks of a
                    wrecked mind. I trust, however, she was sufficiently pious to be saved. This case should be a
                    warning to all highly excitable people, not to neglect their ordinary food and rest, whatever may be
                    the state of their feelings.</p>
            <pb n="47" id="VAA4025-023-1-053"/>
            <p>I was at the meeting in the Bottom a part of the time, and found it a meeting of great interest. For
                    the age of the country, the congregation was very large, and there was a good supply of most able
                    preachers. Among them were John Sale, the presiding elder, John Langdon, Adbell Coleman, Elijah
                    Sparks, John Collins, and the preachers of the circuit. John Langdon preached a good sermon from 2
                    Timothy ii, 19. Coleman preached a most charming sermon from Judges v, 20, in which he showed, how
                    God in his providence, employed everything in the universe to oppose sin and sinners, and to protect
                    and bless the good who trust in him. His sermon was most impressive in the grave manner of his
                    delivery. I do not remember Sale's text, but the sermon was rich in most instructive
                    matter. But the crowning sermon for popularity and effect was preached by Collins, from the words of
                    Paul to Timothy, <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partakers of other men's sins.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>How he used the text for a practical purpose, I do not now remember, but I recollect, after briefly
                    stating that Paul intended to admonish Timothy, not to ordain men to the whole ministry prematurely,
                    he gave the text some accommodated meaning, which had a powerful effect on the people. "
                    Those who knew the man in his lifetime, remember his very curly head, a little inclined to gray at
                    that time, his peculiar eyebrows, his keen blue eyes, his fair skin, the loss of his fore teeth,
                    but, above all, his shrill voice, and pathetic manner. Perhaps all these things never appeared to
                    better advantage than on that occasion. In his sermon, he stated that he had formerly gone from
                    orthodoxy into Universalism, and from Universalism into deism, and just as he was going to hell, God
                    saved his soul. This short account of his own experience thrilled the congregation.</p>
            <p>This meeting made a very powerful impression in favor of religion in general, and of Methodism in
                    particular. 0, the solemnity of my feelings, while I looked at the dense crowd of human heads, as
                    the people all stood up to sing, which they did with great earnestness. If the Methodists have lost
                    any <pb n="48" id="VAA4025-023-1-054"/> of their glory, it is that of their most earnest powerful
                    congregational singing, when there was not a ditty, or foolish thing, sung among them; but they sang
                    the rich hymns in their hymn book; and their singing was as the sound of many waters. 0, that we had
                    our good singing back again. I think the meeting described was the first of a series of camp
                    meetings, which were held on the same ground for a number of years in succession. In this, however,
                    I may be mistaken. If I am mistaken I would be glad if some person of a better memory than my own
                    would correct me.</p>
            <p>After this number, there will be a little more diversity in the scene, as I shall have two circuits
                    to describe instead of one, for White Water circuit was divided in the fall of 1810, and the lower
                    part was called Enon. The name is scriptural, and intended to be descriptive of the country which
                    abounds in many waters. Let any man travel that country when the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> is
                    full, and the water extends back into the country from three to eight miles, and he will have his
                    heart's content of water and ice, especially as it was then when there were few ferryboats
                    and no bridges, and he would have to swim his horse by the side of the canoe, or skiff, as I have
                    done at the risk of my life, or cross on a swimming horse without any canoe or skiff, as others have

                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and then the reader will see why the circuit was called Enon. Tanner's and
                    Wilson's creeks, the two Hogans, which came together near the river, Laughery's,
                    Arnold's, Grant's, Bryant's, Loglick, Plum, and Indian cheeks, and Indian <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, making in all twelve troublesome streams when the river is swollen, besides other
                    smaller streams which are inconvenient when the river is very high. Many times also, the river
                    overflows its own banks and bottoms, so that it is impossible to travel up or down it by land.
                    Sometimes, if the preaching places were five or six miles apart, the preacher would have to travel
                    ten or twelve or more miles to get to his appointment and this extra travel was over high and steep
                    hills, often without a road or even a path. Since many of the circuits are divided by the <pb n="49" id="VAA4025-023-1-055"/> most inconvenient streams, the brethren traveling them cannot realize
                    the inconveniences of former times.</p>
            <p>It was soon found, however, that this vague name, Enon, did not answer a good purpose, as there was
                    no post-town of that name, and it was changed to that of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and so remained until the town of that name became a station, and the name was lost
                    from the circuit. The old circuit is now divided into four stations and seven circuits, in which are
                    employed about fifteen traveling preachers, and the membership are several thousands more than there
                    were then hundreds, and the prospect is still onward.</p>

                    </placeName> district with Moses Crume on the White Water circuit, and Walter Griffith on the Enon
                    circuit. Crume and Thompson had finished their labors on the undivided circuit with much
                    acceptability and usefulness, and had gone to conference, having a strong hold on the affections of
                    the people whom they left behind; hence, when Crume returned to White Water, he found a warm-hearted
                    and loving people, who received him kindly as an affectionate father; but as he was not a warm
                    preacher, and being alone on the circuit there were some fears that we should have a languid year.</p>
            <p>Langdon, the presiding elder, was an entire stranger to all the people and he, also, was not a very
                    warm preacher, but a very grave, sound, and talented divine. The first quarterly meeting for the
                    year was at Manwarring's, the preaching house for our neighborhood. Some of us, however,
                    had to go four miles, or more, to preaching, and class and night prayer meetings. Langdon being a
                    stranger to us, we observed him closely and I found he was a thoughtful and prayerful man of God.
                    His preaching, as I have observed, was not warm, but it was well studied, and very evangelical, and
                    directed to the <pb n="50" id="VAA4025-023-1-056"/> judgment and consciences of the hearer, and
                    admirably calculated to enlighten the inquiring mind, and to console and establish the feeble and
                    trembling soul, as mine then was. His sermon on Saturday was from Revelation xvi, 15, from which he
                    showed our perilous condition in this world, and the absolute necessity of constant watchfulness. On
                    Sabbath, he preached from Lamentations iii, 26, from which he exhibited most clearly God's
                    plan of salvation and presented to the audience the true Methodistic view of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">economy</settlement>
                    </placeName> of human salvation, and very much disabused the public mind, so far as that mind had
                    been led to think the Methodists believed they could save themselves by their own works.</p>
            <p>This quarterly meeting was very edifying, but not very successful in the awakening and conversion of
                    souls. This was the first meeting at which I was present where the holy sacrament was administered
                    after I had joined the church. For fear of eating and drinking unworthily, I did not approach the
                    holy table; and my heart seemed as if it would burst with grief, and my eyes poured forth fountains
                    of tears; and in the midst of my weeping, I thought of that passage which says, <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Esau found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>This passage well nigh drove me into despair. On Sunday evening, there was a meeting near where I
                    lived, at the house of Mr. Merrin, before mentioned. After meeting I remained, and told the
                    preachers the distress of my soul; and Langdon mn showed me that I had wholly mistaken the meaning
                    of the apostle, who simply meant that Esau could not change the mind and purpose of his father,
                    Isaac, so as to obtain the blessing of the first-born, and that it did not apply to my case in any
                    way; for I did repent of my neglect of duty.</p>
            <p>I mention this case for three reasons. First, there may be other souls as ignorant as I was, who may
                    be troubled by a similar mistake. Secondly, to encourage all such to go to their godly ministers
                    with their difficult cases of conscience. Thirdly to remind ministers, that they should well
                    understand the holy Scriptures, so as to be prepared to instruct, relieve, and console the ignorant
                    and desponding. I am sure a week's <pb n="51" id="VAA4025-023-1-057"/> preaching could have
                    not done me the good which I derived from the two or three hours' conversation which I had
                    with the men of God who were present on that occasion.</p>
            <p>In the spring, the presiding elder sent a man by the name of Homes to travel with Crume on the
                    circuit. Homes had no family, except a wife who, for the most part, traveled with him on the
                    circuit. She was an almost incessant smoker, and her husband would have to stop frequently at houses
                    to light her pipe. So often had he to do this that I became disgusted with her, as I used to pilot
                    them in strange ways when they first came on the circuit. In the families where they were
                    entertained, she would take the liberty to tell how they fared as to food and lodging at such and
                    such places; and the people justly inferred that as she talked to them about others, she also talked
                    to others about them, so that her itinerancy was by no means desirable to the circuit. I then
                    learned what I have never forgotten: first, that it is a matter of very great importance for a
                    traveling preacher to have the right kind of a wife for his work; for if he have not, she will blast
                    his usefulness; secondly, I learned that, although the people may be pleased to see the
                    preacher's wife occasionally, they have no wish that she should become extensively
                    itinerant. Homes himself was rather a feeble man in intellect, but was a very zealous man in prayer
                    and declamation, and was exceedingly popular with the multitude. He was, to a considerable extent,
                    useful on the circuit and had he been unencumbered, and wisely advised, he might have made a
                    valuable man. What became of him after the year ended, I know not but I was told he did not turn out
                    well. With Crume at the helm, he and Homes were successful, and the year passed off well in
                    everything but support, which was very small, as was usual in these early times; and it would be
                    well if that state of things had passed by at the present day.</p>
            <p>This year, also, there were two camp meetings on the circuit. One was near Manwarring's, not
                    far from the one held by Shaw in the summer of 1809. When it was resolved to hold this meeting, we
                    were devout in all our operations. It was on Home's preaching day that we met to prepare
                    the ground. After preaching we went to the woods and knelt down on the <pb n="52" id="VAA4025-023-1-058"/> ground, and Homes prayed most fervently, and our hearts were in perfect
                    unison with his in this matter. After prayer, we worked in the fear of the Lord, and made good
                    preparation for that early day; for we had not the lumber to make such comfortable establishments as
                    are made at the present time at many camp meetings. When the camp meeting came on, we had much
                    ministerial help of the right kind. Among the popular and useful preachers were Elijah Sparks, Cajet
                    MGuire, who had formerly traveled, but was now local, John Collins, Walter Griffith, and other of
                    less note. Crume's wife was there; and, what was at that time rather a rare thing, she
                    professed to enjoy the blessing of perfect love, and she was a great blessing to the meeting,
                    especially to the sisterhood. Who can remember that intelligent, modest, gifted woman, without
                    devout thanks to God for that providence which permitted him to become acquainted with such an angel
                    in human form? Although she was a small woman, and disfigured by the loss of one eye, yet her
                    person, and features, and manners were agreeable, and her spirit of prayer made her uncommonly
                    interesting. She has been some years safely housed high up in heaven, and has left few superiors, or
                    even equals in this world.</p>
            <p>The meeting was attended with much of the divine power and blessing, and many souls were awakened and
                    converted. At this meeting I learned some lessons of importance. During the first part of the
                    meeting, I viewed the altar exercises in a cool, stoical manner, until my heart became hard, and my
                    mind skeptical, to such a degree, that my soul was as miserable as it could well be out of hell. In
                    the midst of my dreadful distress, Crume came to me, and asked me how I felt? I told him of my
                    misery, and he invited me to come into the altar, and hear the mourners weep and pray, and join in
                    prayer with and for them. With much reluctance, I consented, and the snare of the devil was broken
                    in five minutes, and his poor prisoner released from his misery. Here I learned that a neglect of
                    duty, and cold criticisms on the work of God's grace, were not good for the soul.</p>
            <p>My wife, although very moral, had never manifested much concern for religion, but now she seemed to
                    be thoroughly <pb n="53" id="VAA4025-023-1-059"/> broken up, and wept most bitterly, when the
                    sisters persuaded her to go into the altar, and almost immediately her tears were gone and her heart
                    almost as hard as it ever was. From this I learned that although the altar, crowded with many
                    penitents, is a good place for thousands—perhaps the majority of seekers, yet there are
                    some who can be better composed, and seek the Lord to better advantage elsewhere than in the crowded
                    altar, where the exercises are so diversified: hence, I never press persons to go into the altar
                    against their inclination.</p>
            <p>About this time, persons, in what are called the higher walks of life, became religious and joined
                    the Methodists. I remember one, a Miss Mildred Watts, the daughter of a Baptist preacher, who broke
                    through all the restraints of educational prejudice, and became a most meek, devout, and decided
                    Methodist. She lived in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> but had her membership on this side the river, is I mistake not. She was at this
                    meeting, and was most happy. I do not know whether Judge Dunn, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and his excellent wife, had then joined; but I remember he was at this meeting, and
                    his feelings were mellow, and his former prejudices giving way very fast. About the same time, or a
                    little before, a most estimable family by the name of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Morehead</settlement>
                    </placeName>, living near Indian creek in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Butler county</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, joined, and their house became a
                    preaching place for many years. It was in their house, I was licensed to preach in 1813. I may say
                    in a few words, that this camp meeting did more or less good from the Forks of White Water, where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> now is, down to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and even to the shores of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, a distance of more than thii-ty miles. There were many objections and cavilings
                    against the preaching and doings of this meeting, especially by people of other denominations; but
                    the church never heeded them, and the cause of God, under the form of Methodism, still grew and
                    prospered.</p>
            <p>The second camp meeting for this year was held about four miles from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton</region>
                    </placeName>, the county town of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Butler county</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, near Four Mile creek, on the premises of
                    John Gray, mentioned in my fourth number. This meeting was the fourth quarterly meeting for the
                    conference year, and I attended it, <pb n="54" id="VAA4025-023-1-060"/> having been made one of the
                    circuit stewards. Solomon Lang-don presided in the quarterly meeting conference with great dignity,
                    and Elijah Sparks, the talented lawyer and preacher, described in my fifth number was in attendance
                    from Enon circuit, and acted as secretary, and Moses Crume represented the cases of the local
                    preachers, exhorters, stewards, and leaders (for then it was customary to examine the leaders), with
                    so much wisdom, prudence, and piety, that it was a privilege to sit in such a quarterly conference.
                    I well remember it was objected to one leader, that he did not shut the door when he met his class,
                    and it was voted that he be admonished, and if he did not amend, the preacher was requested to
                    remove him. This course was sharing the odium with the preachers that sometimes ensues when a leader
                    is removed for not adhering strictly to the rules of <hi rend="i">Discipline</hi>.</p>
            <p>The public exercises of this meeting were very interesting. The preaching was of a superior cast; and
                    how could it be otherwise, when such master-spirits for talents, piety, zeal, and usefulness were in
                    attendance as Solomon Langdon, Elijah Sparks, John Collins, and others not inferior to good medium
                    preachers. Arthur W. Elliott, of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> conference was then commencing to exhort, and delivered an exhortation one night at
                    this meeting. I feel some hesitancy to state the convictions of my mind, but it seems to me, that he
                    could have been heard distinctly one mile in every direction, on that still night. He, of course was
                    not then very intellectual, but his exhortation had a powerful effect on the people. John Collins,
                    however, was the one to melt men's souls. He preached from Isaiah lv, 6, a most solemn
                    sermon. I have since read Sau-rin's sermon, and I suppose Collins obtained a great deal of
                    the matter of the three divisions of his sermon from the three sermons, of that admirable divine on
                    the same text. If Collins did borrow much of his matter then, the manner and spirit were all his
                    own. I think I learned the great secret of his power to melt an audience; for while he was talking
                    in the preacher's tent to another preacher about the engagedness of the mourners, the tears
                    ran down his face: hence, I am sure the feelings of the man's heart were the secret of his
                    great power to move others. This meeting, like the other, wound <pb n="55" id="VAA4025-023-1-061"/>
                    up with great good to the surrounding country and the year closed most delightfully.</p>
            <p>My personal knowledge of the state of things on Enon circuit that year was very limited, and most of
                    the interesting events of those days must remain forever unknown in this world; for the prominent
                    actors are all gone, and there are none to tell their deeds. Langdon, Sparks, Griffith, and the
                    fathers in the societies, are all gone to their long homes; and I can only say a few things from
                    shreds of information derived from the people, by being their preacher in after years, when I had
                    not thought of committing anything of this nature to paper. My information was, that it was a year
                    of great success in the Big Bottom, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, at Tanner's creek, the two Hogans, Loglick and Indian creek. In that day, and
                    for many years after, there was not much impression made on Laughry. When I commenced traveling in
                    December, 1816, there was a small and feeble society at the Widow Brinton's, at the foot of
                    the hill, a little below and on the opposite side of the creek from where Hartford now is. I should
                    have concluded that Griffith went as low as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, were it not that I have interesting written documents informing me otherwise.</p>
            <p>Walter Griffith was then in the prime of life, and just admitted into the traveling connection on
                    trial, and was full of zeal, and had an excellent helper in Elijah Sparks, who lived contiguous to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the only town in the circuit. There were also some exhorters who were useful in the
                    lately formed but rising societies. What number of members fell to each circuit when White Water was
                    divided, I have no means of ascertaining, so that I cannot give the increase of each circuit
                    separately this year; but I find at the close of the year, there were on the two circuits eight
                    hundred and seventy-three, being an increase of two hundred and thirty-five, which was a good
                    increase in this new country. The reader should bear in mind the kind of country (described in a
                    former number) the preacher had to travel over on Enon circuit. Most of this region, except the Big
                    Bottom, was more sparsely settled than the White Water and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> regions and the difficulties of traveling consequently much more. The country <pb n="56" id="VAA4025-023-1-062"/> being more recently settled, and the people less cultivated, and
                    the accommodations in all respects inferior, with the small exception already made, Walter Griffith,
                    who was in easy circumstances, and had a most charming and pious wife at home, must have felt it no
                    small cross to be a traveling preacher among these creeks and high and numerous hills; but his
                    burning zeal and indomitable resolution, sustained by the grace of God, supported him, and he
                    traveled with much cheerfulness, while God owned his labors; and long did his name live with the
                    people of that circuit. Even to this day, there are some who have a fond recollection of the man and
                    his preaching on that new and wild field, of labor.</p>

            <p rend="center">No. X</p>
            <p>Having brought down my sketches to the autumn of 1814, I now approach a period of great interest to
                    the Church and the nation. For some years the commanders of English warships had been in the
                    practice of searching American vessels, and seizing men, claiming them as British subjects and
                    deserters from their government. In the course of these seizures many of our countrymen were pressed
                    into the service of a foreign and rival nation. In addition to these outrages, the commander of a
                    British ship had fired into an American ship in time of peace, not far from our own shore, and
                    killed several Americans. About this time the Indian tribes on our borders seemed to be placing
                    themselves in a hostile attitude, being excited thereto, as was currently believed, by British
                    agents under pay and instructions from their government. All these things, with a lively remembrance
                    of the injuries of the Revolution tended to make the American people exceedingly sore and
                    belligerent in their feelings. Late in the fall General Harrison, governor of the Indiana territory,
                    was sent by the constituted authorities of the general government, with a small army of regulars and
                    militia, to the town of a pretended Shawnee prophet on the <geogName>Tippecanoe river</geogName>, to
                    ascertain the designs of the Indians. In the latter part of the night, just <pb n="57" id="VAA4025-023-1-063"/> as the general and his aids were getting ready to call up the men who
                    had been ordered to sleep on their arms, the Indians made a furious and simultaneous attack on
                    several parts of the lines doubtless intending and expecting to drive <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison</region>
                    </placeName> and his men out of the narrow strip of woods, in which they had encamped, to the open
                    prairies, while the Indians would occupy the woods, and deal death at every fire of their rifles;
                    but in consequence of the courage and promptness of the general and his noble officers and men, the
                    Indians failed in their expectations, and lost more of their own warriors than had been usual in
                    their battles with the whites.</p>
            <p>This was, however, a sore battle to our people; for many of them fell, and the bones of many a brave
                    man now lie enclosed and buried on that ground. Often have I stood on it, and passed by it, and felt
                    mournful and sad. This battle and slaughter of our men produced one simultaneous feeling in favor of
                    war almost all over the nation, but particularly in the western country, where many lived who had
                    never forgiven the Indians the loss of their friends in former Indian wars, nor the English for
                    encouraging the savages in their ruthless slaughter of men, women, and children.</p>
            <p>Doubtless there are circumstances which will justify civilized and even Christian nations in going to
                    war; and such were the circumstances in the American Revolution and the War of 1812. In general,
                    however, a war spirit is to be deplored, as the greatest calamity which can befall the morals and
                    religion of any nation, but more particularly a nation with a republican form of government; for
                    under such a form of government, the mass of the people feel its demoralizing effects. In
                    monarchies, where they have standing armies, it is somewhat different; for the mass of the people
                    feel very little concern about the wars which may be carried on, as they are to be managed and
                    fought by the standing armies. This is always the case unless the nation is in imminent danger of
                    invasion. No Christian man can think about war, with its concomitants, without the utmost horror,
                    even if it be a justifiable one. The sufferings, and groans, and death of the soldiers, horrible as
                    they may be, are the least of the injuries of the people at large. The unholy desire for gain,
                    produced by <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-023-1-064"/> the lavish and often injudicious expenditure of the
                    public treasure, makes a nation of covetous and reckless speculators, whose moral principles are
                    ruined.</p>
            <p>But the great injury to religion is found in the desecration of the holy Sabbath and a disregard for
                    its services. The day of judgment alone will tell the mischief done in this way. Often conscientious
                    men are placed in circumstances, that they have to do what they would never do under other
                    circumstances. When I became religious I took Isaiah lviii, 53, for my rule of observing the
                    Sabbath; but after holding meeting as an exhorter, in the spring of 1812, I went home and made a
                    scabbard for my butcher-knife and made other preparation to march, as I expected an officer every
                    moment to call us to the frontier, where the Indians had been killing and scalping some of the
                    citizens. I mention this circumstance merely to show the evils of war to religion by its Sabbath
                    profanation. This was the last work of a secular kind which I have done on the holy day.</p>
            <p>The war spirit, however, continued to increase, until Congress declared war, having failed to obtain
                    redress of grievances in any other way. Now we went to war in earnest, with all the bad blood common
                    in time of war. It is strange to think, at this distance of time, of the kind of preaching which was
                    not then uncommon. William Burke preached to the soldiers in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> on their march north from Joel iii, 9, 10, and Joshua L. Wilson from Jeremiah xlviii,
                    10, and Elijah Sparks at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to a company of volunteers, from 1 Samuel xvii, latter part of the 47th verse. When we
                    consider the nature of Christ's kingdom and the character of the ministry of
                    reconciliation, we must say, such sermons have very little of the spirit or work of a Gospel
                    minister in them; and it is to be hoped that we shall never again see the times which seem to call
                    for such apparent desecration of the holy ministry which these excellent men then perpetrated. If
                    Jesus said to a man in his day, follow thou me, and let the dead bury their dead, surely Gospel
                    ministers should let the potsherds of the earth strive with the potsherds of the earth, but they
                    should preach the unsearchable riches of Christ to the citizens and soldiers while they are
                    soldiers; but if nations <pb n="59" id="VAA4025-023-1-065"/> and individuals would repent and cease
                    from sin, there would be no soldiers, for there would be no need for any. I cannot help thinking
                    that the very existence of the expensive war department in a Christian nation is a reproach to such
                    nation.</p>
            <p>I am not so much of an enthusiast, however, as to think that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> could do without this department, while other powers retain theirs. When Christianity
                    shall have imbued this world with its benign spirit, wars will cease to the ends of the earth. I
                    hope the reader will pardon this digression, if indeed it be a digression, for it seems to me every
                    speaker and writer is in the direct course of duty, when he does all that he can, to root out the
                    savage spirit of war from the earth.</p>
            <p>The reader will doubtless think that Methodism was used up on the White Water and Enon circuits, as
                    they were frontier regions. This, however, was not the case, for God, in his divining providence,
                    prepared strong preventives. In the first place, the pious and patriotic Langdon was continued on
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> district, and Robert W. Finley sent to White Water circuit, and Walter Griffith
                    reappointed to Enon circuit the name being changed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. These men began their labors with great zeal and with an expectation of success.
                    Finley was quite an old man, and to human appearance, one stormy winter would send him to his grave;
                    but this appearance wag quite a mistake, for he could preach and pray and exhort day and night the
                    year round. His preaching was of the most terrific character, calculated to awaken the most hardened
                    sinner. Griffith's preaching was pointed and powerful, and calculated to be successful; but
                    the malign war spirit, which seemed to be needed in our circumstances, would have neutralized their
                    efforts, if God had not made the earth help them.</p>
            <p>The same fall in which these men came on the circuits named, and in which the battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> was fought, the whole western country was shaken by earthquakes of a severe kind. These
                    earthquakes lasted the larger part of a year, in which we would have occasional shakes; but they
                    were not so severe after the winter passed by. The first shock was on Sunday night, or rather Monday
                    morning. I and my family <pb n="60" id="VAA4025-023-1-066"/> were sound asleep when the cracking and
                    jarring of the house awakened us, and I saw the cradle rocking in the midst of the floor without any
                    hand touching it. I was then living in a part of my father's house, and I and my brothers
                    started up to search for a file of newspapers, in which we remembered to have some articles on
                    earthquakes. We found the articles, and they assured us there was no danger from this phenomenon,
                    unless in mountainous regions, and we went to bed and slept again quietly, at least I did. When day
                    arrived, I felt anxious to have another shake that I might witness its appearance in daylight, and I
                    was soon gratified, for after I and my brothers had finished feeding the animals, I was leaning
                    against the fence, and I felt it begin to shake, and looking at the barn, I saw it shaking
                    fearfully. This shake satisfied my curiosity, and I would have been glad for this to be the last;
                    but the thing having begun, did not end so readily; for in February, we had shakes still more
                    terrible. For some time after these earthquakes began, we were at a loss to conjecture where they
                    had their seat of empire. We were sure from the movements, it could not be in the
                        <geogName>Alleghany mountains</geogName>, as we supposed the <geogName>Rocky
                    mountains</geogName> were too far off to produce so sensible an effect where we lived. After some
                    weeks of painful suspense we learned the seat of the ruin was in the low <geogName>Mississippi
                        valley</geogName> and even under the mighty river in the vicinity of New Madrid. This fact
                    destroyed the theory of our writer about the danger of earthquakes being only in the region of
                    mountains. We began to think if fire and ruin could burst up from under the <geogName>Mississippi
                        river</geogName>, the same might occur under the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName>, or even White Water, and the whole country became alarmed and the most vile and
                    hardened sinners began to tremble and quake, and go to meeting, and weep and pray. Now every
                    preacher, traveling and local, with the exhorters, began to hold meetings with more earnestness than
                    ever, in almost all directions, and Baptist ministers did the same, and it seemed as if almost
                    everybody would become religious that winter and spring. Some men were converted and became
                    preachers, whose conversion I had been in the habit of regarding as almost as hopeless as the
                    conversion of the devil himself.</p>
            <pb n="61" id="VAA4025-023-1-067"/>
            <p>There was one man by the name of William Ramsey, whom I had regarded as the most profane and wicked
                    man I ever knew; who became as tame and timid as a lamb. A few months after he was soundly
                    converted, he became a useful preacher, and continued so for years, while he remained in our part of
                    the country. He afterward moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and became, as I have been informed, a Newlight, or follower of Barton W. Stone,
                    formerly of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, afterward of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Time would fail me to tell of the individual and family hard cases that became members
                    of the church and many of them truly converted; many of them, however, were only scared from their
                    sins for a season: not being renewed in their hearts, they endured but for a season.</p>
            <p>After the earth ceased to shake much, and the war began in earnest, we began to feel the pressure in
                    matters of religion. But such was the impetus given to the church by the causes named, that we
                    hardly felt the reaction while Fin-ley and Griffith remained on the circuits. 0, how Langdon and
                    others used to pray for our men, especially our brethren who were in Hull's campaign, that
                    God might preserve their lives and piety; and in this matter their prayers were heard; for perhaps
                    there were never so few lives lost as in that unfortunate and unsuccessful campaign. Indeed, the
                    whole church used to feel the need of sustaining grace, and prayed for it much.</p>
            <p>The last quarterly meeting for White Water circuit was a camp meeting held on the land of Mr. Thomas
                    Williams, Sr., between three quarters and a mile from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The grove in which the meeting was held is long since gone, and the tall corn now
                    grows on the ground where pious hundreds worshiped God most devoutly. When I passed up and down the
                    river, I look at the sacred spot, and think of the days of other years, and am tempted to be sad.
                    Langdon, the presiding elder, preached a most excellent and instructive sermon from I Timothy i, 15,
                    in which he showed most clearly that the Scriptures teach a four-fold salvation. First, an initial
                    salvation, in which all infants and idiots share. Secondly, a salvation embracing pardon and
                    regeneration, in which the penitent and believing sinner shares. Thirdly entire <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-023-1-068"/> sanctification, in which the persevering Christian shares. Fourthly,
                    eternal glory, in which dying infants and idiots, and all believers who hold out to the end, share.
                    William Lines, who was introduced to the reader, in the sycamore grove, at the upper part of the Big
                    Bottom, was present and preached usefully. Old brother Finley preached the first whole sermon on
                    baptism, which I ever heard preached by a Methodist preacher, at this meeting on Sabbath. The text
                    was Matthew xxviii, 19, literally rendered from the Greek, using the word disciple for the word
                    teach. The sermon was strongly controversial and was a little more strongly anti-immersion than the
                    Methodist <hi rend="i">Discipline</hi>. I well remember one expression of the preacher, which was,
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>"I will not say that any man who baptizes by immersion is an indecent man, but I
                            will say, he has been guilty of an indecent act."</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, whether the sermon did good or harm, or whether it was time and talents and labor
                    thrown away, I cannot say. We sometimes are compelled by circumstances to preach for hours on the
                    subject of baptism, as a matter of controversy, but such necessity is to be deplored and the persons
                    who cause it are much to blame. How our immersion friends and their antagonists account to God for
                    the time lost and the bitter feelings engendered about a mere circumstance of religion, I cannot
                    tell. There must be utterly a fault about this matter somewhere.</p>
            <p>The success of this year was very great, for the White Water circuit increased from five hundred and
                    sixty-seven to eight hundred and forty-seven, being an increase of two hundred and eighty; and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> circuit increased from three hundred and six to four hundred and eighty-nine, being an
                    increase of one hundred and eighty-three, so that notwithstanding the antagonistic influences named,
                    this year was a most glorious one for the church. It is true, the high pressure movements of this
                    year were succeeded with a sad reaction the next year, and it was some years before the church was
                    as healthy and vigorous as she had been.</p>

            <p>M<hi rend="sc">Y</hi> first recollection that I have of my ancestors was hearing my grandfather,
                    James Bruce, telling that himself and a younger brother, George Bruce, came from <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName> about the year 1740. My grandfather located in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Winchester</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>. He
                    was a house carpenter by trade, and I have heard him say that he built the first frame house that
                    was ever built in that town.</p>
            <p>About the year 1744 he married a Margaret McMahon and moved to the north branch of the Potomac in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>. He continued there, following his trade and farming, until he raised a large family of
                    children. My father, William Bruce, was the eldest. He was born the 14th day of February, 1745.
                    There were two sons younger than my father and six daughters, viz., Elizabeth, who married a man by
                    the name of Thomas Anderson; Margaret, who married David Cox; Jane, who married a William Marshall;
                    Nancy, who married Samuel Percifull, and who was married to Samuel Glass; and James, who married
                    Polly Runyen; George, who married the widow Biggs. My father married a widow Percifull, and the
                    youngest sister, Sally, married a Joshua Carmen, a Baptist preacher, a man of excellent character
                    and a considerable speaker. He moved to the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> about fifty years ago, raised a large family and died in a good old age, about
                    eighty-five.</p>
            <p>From the above enumerated uncles and aunts there has sprung an almost innumerable multitude. They
                    mostly moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> at an early day and settled in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Nelson county</region>
                    </placeName>. My father, soon after he married my mother, moved to the Monongahela, settled about 14
                    miles above Pittsburg, between the mouth of Peter's creek and Newels' store, now
                    Elizabeth-town. It was then the haunt of Indians, and forts were the only place of safety for the
                    families of those hardy pioneers. I had two sisters older than myself that were born in the <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-023-1-070"/> fort, and I, the third child, was born soon after they ventured
                    to their farms. I was born the 6th day of August, 1776, one month and two days after the
                    independence was declared. I can, with the Apostle Paul, say that I was free born.</p>
            <p>While our forefathers had to obtain their freedom by their blood and treasure during the
                    Revolutionary war, my father was frequently called upon to perform military service.</p>
            <p>The first that I recollect him talking about was being stationed at a place then called
                    Catfish's camp, called after an old Indian chief, near a place now called <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> and not far from a place on the Monongahela then called Red Stone. My father served
                    then in the capacity of lieutenant. The next service he performed was under General George Rogers
                    Clarke. He commanded a company under that veteran soldier to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and was absent from home some five or six months.</p>
            <p>As to my mother's family I have a very imperfect knowledge. Her maiden name was Polly Lucas.
                    Her first husband was Richard Percifull. After his death she married my father. My grandfather by my
                    mother's side was William Lucas. What my Grandmother Lucas' maiden name was I
                    never learned, as she died about my first recollection. My Grandfather Lucas died before I was born.
                    All I know is that he was a sea-faring man.</p>
            <p>I recollect an uncle Robinson Lucas and two aunts. They married two brothers, William and Dennis
                    Murphy, and moved to the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> at an early date. As I before observed, I was born at a time that tried men's
                    souls. None but a man that had no fear of Indians would venture to risk his family where the
                    prowling wolf and subtile savage roamed.</p>
            <p>There the Whig and Tory often lived in one fort, but it happened that my grandfather and father were
                    true American Whigs. I fortunately partook of the same spirit and have retained it to this day.</p>
            <p>When I was about nine years old, my father sold his plantation on the Monongahela and moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. I think it was in the fall of 1784. We landed at the mouth of Bear Grass. Louisville
                    was then a small village and there was a <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-023-1-071"/> garrison with some <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> troops kept there. We lived there that winter and in the spring of 1785 moved on the
                    waters of Coxes creek, (now <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Nelson county</region>
                    </placeName>) named after my uncle, David Cox, who had settled there a few years previous. My father
                    bought 200 acres of land and commenced making a farm. The first settlers had just ventured from the
                    forts. I recollect having to stand and watch while my father was at work, with his rifle well braced
                    standing against a tree close at hand.</p>
            <p>About this time Colonel Isaac Cox was killed by the Indians while out surveying on a branch called
                    Powel's run, waters of the east look of Coxes creek and about four miles from where my
                    father lived. ‘This made quite a stir in the neighborhood, and men were stationed at
                    different places along the frontier settlements.</p>
            <p>That was the last murder that was committed by the Indians between <geogName>Salt river</geogName>
                    and Bardstown. From that time on until the close of the Indian war, after General Anthony Wayne gave
                    them such a scourging, times gradually became more safe, and settlements were pushed on to the
                        <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>, At the age of 22 I was married to the third daughter of Captain
                    Charles Polke, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Shelby county</region>
                    </placeName>, and the youngest of his four children who were taken prisoners by the Indians when
                    they took and burnt his fort. He had been called away with his company of militia from
                    Simpson's creek, where his fort stood, to succor the fort on Bear Grass, as it was
                    believed, from the sign that had been discovered, that the enemy in a large body was about to make a
                    descent on the forts in that quarter. But the wily savages, after they found that the principal part
                    of the men had been called away, changed their course, and near 100 of them attacked Polke Station,
                    killed several, and took the rest prisoners, after burning the fort.</p>
            <p>Among the prisoners was my mother-in-law and the four children above mentioned, to-wit: William
                    Polke, who has been very consp'icuous from the early settling of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, until his death about eight years ago, having filled various important
                    trusts. He was one who helped frame the first constitution of Indiana in 1816. He was commissioner
                        <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-023-1-072"/> for the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> road for a number of years, frequently served in the legislature of the state, and was
                    register of the land office at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> at the time of his death.</p>
            <p>The eldest daughter, Elizabeth, married Captain Spier Spencer, who fell in the battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>. He was of Indian fighting notoriety, and his death was much lamented.</p>
            <p>The second daughter, Nancy, married Peter Ruby. Some of her children are still living in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox county</region>
                    </placeName>. The third, Sally, became my wife October 23d, 1798. I then bought me a small tract of
                    land on the waters of Coxes creek, NeIson county, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, and made a small farm, when an older claim took it away from me.</p>
            <p>I then packed up what little plunder I had, my wife, and four children, on horseback, and moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in the spring of 1805, and rented five acres of ground to raise corn, for
                    which I paid $25.00 cash. Those were pretty tough times. That summer I purchased 200
                    acres on which Bruceville now stands, built a cabin, and in October the same year, moved to it. I
                    had a few white neighbors scattered about and quite a number of redskins, hunting and traveling
                    through all parts of our country, the Delawares, Miamis, Shawnees, Potawatomies, etc.; but at that
                    time they were entirely friendly and continued so until Tecumseh commenced collecting them at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> in 1809, ‘10, and ‘11, when we had to be more on our guard.</p>
            <p>In September, 1811, the expedition to the Prophet's town started up the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. The summer before I had been ordered by General Wm. Henry Harrison, governor and
                    commissioner in chief of Indiana territory, to bring my command of militia to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and to remain there 20 days, as it was then thought that the Indians intended to make a
                    descent on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. I was there 20 days, and as I was the oldest captain in the regiment, and had
                    performed a tour, the next oldest was called to take the command of the company that was called from
                    our battalion, and as I could not go as an officer, I turned out a volunteer in the spdng, under the
                    captain, Tousaint Dubois, and a more brave and patriotic man did not live, loved by his men and true
                    to his country. Some <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-023-1-073"/> years after, he was drowned on the road
                    from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> home, regretted by all who had the slightest acquaintance with him.</p>
            <p>The army marched about two miles above <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and there built Fort Harrison, and called it after our patriotic general. We were
                    about one month erecting the fort. When it was completed, the army pursued its route up the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> to the mouth of Big <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vermillion</region>
                    </placeName>, when we halted one day and built a block house. From that point, six of the spies six
                    of Robb's company were ordered back by General Harrison, myself among the number, to have
                    the militia in a state of readiness and keep scouts passing every day from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> to <geogName>White River</geogName>, lest the Indians should fall in the rear of the
                    army and surprise and butcher the frontier settlements.</p>
            <p>As Harrison was well acquainted with the Indian character, he took this precaution. The battle was
                    fought the 7th of November, 1811. Our poor men were badly handled and the Indians worse. The night
                    of the battle, myself in company with my then lieutenant and now Esquire Wilkins, of Merom, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan county</region>
                    </placeName>, camped about one and one half miles west of where Edwardsport now stands, having been
                    on the lookout between the two rivers. After a few months of calm, the difficulty broke out afresh.
                    The citizens had to build stockade forts for the protection of their families. We suffered many
                    inconveniences from being so crowded together, nevertheless we were quite peaceable and happy. There
                    is nothing like enemies without to make peace within.</p>
            <p>The fort I lived in was on my own place. Some of the rails made white oak pickets which, I believe,
                    are in existence yet. When peace was again made, it terminated the third frontier life that I had
                    experienced and I hope the last. My family still increased until the year 1818 when I had the
                    misfortune to lose my companion. She died after giving birth to our fifteenth child. She was a pious
                    and worthy member of the Baptist church, and had been for a number of years, and not a doubt remains
                    with me but that her pure spirit winged its way to the climes of Immortal Glory.</p>
            <p>In 1819 I married my second wife, Hetty R. Holmes, daughter of William and Elizabeth Ann Holmes. They
                    moved from North Elkhorn, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette county</region>
                    </placeName>, near <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-023-1-074"/> My present wife
                    is still living, a healthy woman in her 57th year. She has had ten children, seven boys and three
                    girls, nine of whom are living. As I have given a general history of my ancestors as far back as I
                    have my recollection, I will give a more particular detail of my brothers and sisters together with
                    my immediate family and their fruitful increase. My eldest sister married one Joshua MeDonald. They
                    are both dead. Some of their children live in this state. My second sister, Margaret, married John
                    Spencer, oldest brother of Spier Spencer who fell in the battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>. They had 12 or 14 children, some living in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> and near, but most of them in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone county</region>
                    </placeName>, in this state. My sister is still living, now in her 77th year, two years older than
                    myself. My brother, James, who was 15 months younger than myself, married Polly Froma, in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, and moved to Rough creek, <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Brackenridge
                        county</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. He had a large
                    family. They mostly reside in the same county. He has been dead about 17 or 18 years. My youngest

                    William died. He was 15 years old the 12th day of August, 1851, and is now six feet high and pretty
                    well proportioned. I have been blessed with healthy, industrious and economical wives, otherwise my
                    lot would have been more severe. I have always been blessed with sufficient food and raiment to get
                    along comfortably, never burdened with wealth or distressed with penury. My sons and son-in-laws
                    have all been sober, industrious men, all doing reasonably well. They with their wives are almost
                    all professors of the Christian religion, and most of them belong to the Christian congregation of
                    the Disciples. The living members of my family are:</p>

            <p>Thus far the Good Lord has brought me and prospered me. I have endeavored (as far as my fallable
                    nature would permit) to preserve an upright and honest course and the Lord has been my helper and in
                    his merits is my trust.</p>
            <p>I am now at the advanced age of 75 years and have never been one day without something to eat and
                    reasonable raiment. "Blessed be His Holy Name." I have enjoyed uncommon health,
                    never been confined to my bed an entire day in my life, although I feel the outer man decay very
                    sensibly, yet my health is uncommon good. My action is gone, my energy is failing fast, my sight has
                    become so dim that I do not know one of my family half across the house, but still I can see to read
                    and write without my glasses. How great that blessing is!</p>
            <p>About the year 1800 my first wife and myself united with the Baptist church on Coxes creek,
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Nelson county</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-023-1-077"/> We continued our
                    membership there until the spring of 1805, when we received letters of dismission and moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana (then territory). About the fall of 1807, as well as I recollect, we collected
                    12 or 14 scattering Baptists Over as many miles around, and was constituted a church by John Taylor
                    and William Heller, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. The constitution took place at my house, on the tract of land that Bruce-ville now
                    stands on. We called it the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> church. We still gathered a few by letter, some by baptism. Our first preacher was a
                    William Braxelton [Brazelton], quite a speaker but passed off considerable enthusiasm when the
                    Shakers located themselves in this country. He was carried off with them and we were very happily
                    rid of him and his wife.</p>
            <p>We increased until we were strong enough to build us a comfortable log house to worship in, on the
                    same ground that the Presbyterian brick house now stands on the road leading from Bruceville to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Some years after, a number of my first wife's family and other Baptists moved on Maria creek
                    and concluded to be constituted into a church there, when my wife and I received letters of
                    dismission and constituted a church called Maria Creek church. Our membership continued there till
                    her death in 1810. The church prospered greatly for several years after. I think that when a few of
                    us at Bruceville, say nine, petitioned for letters of dismission, as well as I recollect, the church
                    book numbered 170 members, but suspicion got afloat that we intended to be constituted on the
                    scripture without any other creed or confession of faith. The spirit of persecution commenced and on
                    the day we were constituted some twenty more of their members broke off from them and were
                    constituted with us from that time. The old members kept leaving them until more than fifty of their
                    numbers left them and our congregation increased under the ministry of Brother David Warford, first,
                    and Brother Maurice R. Trimble next, until our church numbered over 100. The Good Lord still blesses
                    us. We let off constitution and parts to several constitutions. We still number over 100 and the
                    Good Lord still blesses us with prosperity under the ministry of Brother Wolfe, who preaches for us
                    once a month.</p>
            <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-023-1-078"/>
            <p>But the persecuting spirit of a few of their leading members of poor old Maria Creek church against
                    us and others that think the Scripture sufficient rule for our faith and practice has reduced them
                    to a mere skeleton. Thus far I have given a correct history of my ancestors and my own family as my
                    imperfect memory would allow, together with the length of time and want of records would allow and
                    only have to regret that my progresses in the line of life have been so small.</p>

                    trips in the surrounding country. It is said he was the only Presbyterian minister at that time in

            <p>Decade after decade has passed and with them have gone the scholars that listened to the voice of

                    The children and the grandchildren of the generation that attended there have little knowledge of
                    this school—no records or diaries having been kept or preserved or handed down to

            <p>Richard G. Boone's <hi rend="i">History of Education in Indiana</hi>, published in 1892,
                    Chapter VI, is devoted to Private and Incorporated Seminaries. It is here we find listed
                    Martin's Academy at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Livonia</settlement>, <region type="county">Washington County</region>
               </placeName>, Indiana. Opened 1819, closed 1840. Dr.
                    Boone says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Among the many private schools of that early day it would be inexcusable to fail to call
                            attention to one that was not only among the first but one of the best as
                            well—Martins Academy in <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Livonia</settlement>
                                <region type="county">Washington County</region>
                            </placeName>. But one school of sufficient grade to be ranked with this has so early a
                            history. That was the Corydon Seminary founded in 1816.</p>
                        <p>Martins Academy was founded by Rev. William Martin, a Presbyterian minister and opened in the
                            fall of 1819. It continued for many years, Mr. Martin leaving in the spring of 1831 to take
                            charge of the seminary at Paoli. The course of study included besides the common
                            branches—using Walkers Dictionary (in spelling) the New Testament and English
                            Reader, Pike's Arithmatic and Murry's Grammer, the higher mathematics,
                            moral philosophy, rhetoric, logic, natural philosophy. Among the students there were some
                            from other counties and from disc tant parts of the State and from other states even,
                            particularly from the South. Fees were moderate and silver was scarce, pay was generally in
                            trade. Mr. Martin himself who died in 1850, is still remembered among <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-023-1-083"/> Presbyterians of Southern Indiana as a fine scholar, a
                            successful teacher and royal good preacher. Indeed it is avered by those who knew him that
                            so efficient was his school, if he had been less of a minister (seasons of revival sometimes
                            hindered the continuity of the school); HanOver College might have been located at <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Livonia</settlement>
                            </placeName>. While many students afterward became efficient lawers, physicians and
                            teachers, the academy became known as a sort of school of the ministry. But aside from the
                            generally scholarly training given, the most eminent service rendered by Mr. Martin was in
                            the advanced standing he took upon education of girls. Many parents about <placeName>

                            learning to use the pen. But from the beginning, Martin's Academy was
                            co-educational in principle. The principal's daughter subsequently became his
                            assistant.</p>

                    to whom MY. Boone was indebted for his historical facts in the article on the old academy.</p>
            <p>Dr. Boone's history more than thirty years ago (1892) sets forth clearly the advanced
                    standing of the school and the broad, progressive spirit of its master—emphasized so
                    strongly in the policy of co-education of the sexes.</p>
            <p>But what of the building itself—the primitive structure that reecived the pleasing title
                    of college? The size and appearance of this unpretentious cabin in the clearing, surrounded by the
                    magnificent forest trees—the giant oak and poplar and the beech—"the
                    glory of Indiana woodlands"? Made of hewn logs, with no ceiling, the bare rafters above and
                    a dirt floor, the school opened for sessions. It is reasonable to believe a better interior finish
                    followed in the later years, when it was euphoniously called the "log cdlege".</p>
            <p>What of the boys and girls that sat on the crude benches? What of the lads and lasses that jostled
                    each other at the door when called "to books"? The reader no doubt like the writer
                    of this story, today, longs for the more tangible substances—records, books, and
                    mementoes—proofs which have become scattered and lost, for our efforts have been
                    fruitless, so far in this quest. The roster or roll of this school would be almost a priceless
                    possession now.</p>
            <p>One of the pupils was John P. Scott, who was doubly orphaned by the death of both father and mother

                            baskets. Alarm was spread down town and some men came out, but the panther escaped to his

                            where there is not some aged pilgrim who once heard the gospel from his lips. He delighted
                            to preach in log cabins during the week, and in the shortest plan of doing the greatest good
                            whether they just accorded with Presbyterian etiquette or not. Three discourses on the

                            Christians, he established a school which was very successful—calling in many
                            young men and women from this and other counties. For this school there was built a house of
                            hewn logs which was called by the students, The Log College.</p>

                    grounds of the long ago. Building activities of the town have taken another direction. No houses
                    break the view between the two historic spots—the site of the old log college and the
                    place of interment of its founder. The lot is vacant. Nearby a modest dwelling was pointed out as
                    the place of the old Kelso home. Peace and quiet prevail. To the south of the lot towards the east
                    down a green lane, stands a lone tree with gnarled limbs extended like a sentinel. To the east and
                    north is the population and business of the little city. To the north the whirr of the motor cars
                    carrying travel and traffic, is a reminder that the main thoroughfare of the town, is a highway of
                    importance and that the Atlantic-Pacific road may be just beyond the northern border of the
                    retreat—sacred to the memory of the Martin family.</p>
            <p>The cemetery yard is very neat and clean, beautifully kept by the women and citizens of the
                    community. The grave of the illustrious educator is near the entrance, a sunny, grassy plot, and is
                    marked by a limestone monument about ten feet high—simple and substantial. On the
                    shaft-like marker, carved in the stone is a flaming torch inverted, symbol of light and
                    life—a life closed by the "inevitable hour". Some of the lettering on
                    the rock is nearly oblitered—but quite legible is this inscription: <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-023-1-087"/>

                    </placeName>. To appreciate this it is necessary to go back to the time of the first settlement of
                    the <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> colonies and become acquainted with one of the most important problems which the early
                    settlers met and had to solve, and which continued to embarrass their successors down to the time of
                    the enactment of the National Banking law at the close of the Civil war.</p>
            <p>Almost immediately after the planting of the settlements on the <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> coast the colonists had to face the perplexing problem of supplying themselves with a
                    sufficient amount of that which is commonly called money. At first they used beaver skins and other
                    commodities; and they adopted the shells used by the native Indians as their money. This condition
                    continued until 1690 when the colony of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Bay discovered that the printed paper evidences of debt of the colony could be
                    satisfactorily used as a medium of exchange in the hands of the colonists. After this all the other
                    colonies in course of time adopted this system of providing their people with money.</p>
            <p>But while this money served their people well within their respective colonies it could not be used
                    to advantage in inter colonial trade because it was at a discount when tendered for payment outside
                    the colony issuing it. But in 1775 a beginning was made to overcome this difficulty through an
                    agreement entered into by the colonies of <geogName>Massachusetts Bay</geogName>, <geogName>Rhode
                        Island</geogName> and <geogName>Connecticut</geogName> by which it was agreed that the paper
                    bills of each of these colonies should pass current—that is, should be accepted at
                    par—when offered in payment in either of the other colonies.</p>
            <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-023-1-089"/>
            <p>During all these years the handling of specie, which could be used in payment for imported goods and
                    for a few other purposes for which the paper notes could not be used, was in the hands of dealers in
                    specie. Professor McMaster groups these dealers in two classes, "monied men and speculators
                    in cash". These men were intensely hostile to all forms of paper money because it limited
                    the demand for, and therefore the value of, their wares; but they were unable to prevent its use.
                    And the colonists, having abundant money, prospered marvelously.</p>
            <p>Then came the Revolution. As the cost of the war increased, the paper bills issued both by the states
                    and the Confederation to carry it on grew in volume and depreciated in value until at the end of the
                    war the country was in very much the same condition as is <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> now as the result of its part in the Great War; with the important difference that much
                    of the currency of the Americans was counterfeit. This counterfeit money was put out by the British,
                    for at that time it was considered a legitimate way to strike at the credit of an enemy in time of
                    war. The problem thus presented to both the states and the federal government could be solved only
                    by partial or total repudiation—and this solution was applied.</p>
            <p>After the Revolutionary war was over, three private banks were organized by state authority with the
                    right to issue paper bills; and in 1782 congress chartered a bank having the same
                    privilege—the Bank of North <placeName>
                        <country>America</country>
                    </placeName>. The influence of these banks added to that of the "monied men and speculators
                    in cash" was now sufficiently strong to prevent, to a considerable extent, legislation by
                    the states to restore the systems which had existed before the war. And when the Constitutional
                    Convention met in 1787 these interests were able to force the inclusion in the constitution approved
                    by it of the provision that no state should coin money, emit bills of credit, or make anything but
                    gold and silver a tender for payment of debts.</p>
            <p>Upon the ratification of the constitution the effect of this was to demonetize all the paper money
                    and copper coins then <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-023-1-090"/> in circulation. The circulation which had
                    been only about $4.00 per capita in 1784 fell to $3.00 in 1790, and all
                    business was paralyzed. The imperative need for a medium of exchange forced into existence state
                    banks authorized to issue notes; and by 1795 twenty-five such banks were in operation and by the end
                    of that year the circulation by their aid had increased to $7.75 per capita. Of this
                    amount not more than one dollar per capita came from the Bank of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> which congress had chartered in 1790 and which continued in operation from 1791 to
                    1811.</p>
            <p>The managers of this bank claimed that by their charter they were given a monopoly of the right to
                    emit bank notes; and that the state banks were infringing on their rights. And they at once began a
                    fight to destroy them. Their purpose was announced in the slogan, "No Money but the Money
                    of the Constitution". The war between the federal bank and the state banks was a bitter
                    one. The method adopted by the federal bank consisted in its obtaining notes of state banks and
                    holding them until those of some particular bank, in the opinion of its managers, amounted to more
                    than the bank to be attacked would have in specie. These notes would then be presented for payment
                    and if the full amount was not paid at once in specie the notes would be protested for nonpayment
                    and the bank closed. And partly for protection against counter-attack and partly to keep down the
                    circulation the federal bank emitted no notes in excess of the amount of specie in its vaults. As
                    Professor McMaster expresses it: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The chief cause of the deadly hatred which many of the state banks felt (for the federal
                            bank) was the vigilance with which it watched their issues and the incessant calls it made
                            on them to redeem.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>The charter of the federal bank expired in 1811 and congress refused to renew it. The fact that
                    nearly three-fourths of its stock was owned by foreigners was one argument used against its renewal.
                    Those who have condemned the refusal of congress to renew the charter of this first Bank of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> have claimed, I believe without exception, that the management and credit of the bank
                    were so excellent that its notes were at all times at par with Spanish silver dollars—
                        <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-023-1-091"/> which were the only legal tender coins in the
                    country—and this claim is always conceded. But in a study of this subject some years ago
                    I became satisfied that this could not be true since the world-wide scarcity of specie was such that
                    even the Bank of <placeName>

                    the assumption that the silver dollars wanted were for the bank; and to be paid for with notes of

            <p>The extreme distress because of lack of money continuing the secretary of the treasury late in 1814
                    recommended the chartering of a second Bank of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> in all material respects like the first bank of that name. This was done and a charter
                    was granted for a term of twenty-one years. The policy of its managers was the same as that of their
                    predecessors and their efforts to destroy the state banks were as persistent and as futile. When its
                    charter was about to expire congress voted to renew it, but President Jackson vetoed the bill.</p>
            <p>In 1819 the per capita circulation was only $7.74 and decreasing. In 1828 it had fallen to
                    $5.90. What little coin there was in the country was held in the importing
                    centers—the larger towns of the Atlantic coast. None was in circulation in the hands of
                    the people; and all taxes were payable only in coin. On the 7th day of December, 1822, there was a

            <p>The war on the state banks did not cease with the disappearance of the second federal bank and its
                    successor; but those who waged it made no pretense that they were actuated by the patriotic motive
                    suggested by the slogan of the federal banks. The banks attacked by these later bank wreckers were
                    of the class of state banks known as "free banks", and their notes as
                    "bond secured" currency. They were called free banks because no charter from the
                    state was necessary for their organization. The law authorizing their organization required no more
                    than that the organizers should comply with requirements laid down in a general banking law.</p>
            <p>This law in Indiana required only that those organizing a bank should deposit with a designated state
                    official state bonds to secure payment of the notes to be issued by the bank; and upon such deposit
                    being made the promoters of the bank would at once receive the amount of notes authorized. Upon
                    proof that any of these notes had been presented for payment and that the bank was unable to at once
                    redeem them in <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-023-1-093"/> specie, the custodian of the bonds was required
                    to sell the bonds at public auction for specie and from the proceeds pay the defaulted notes. In
                    those days of scarce specie such a sale necessarily involved to all others interested a heavy loss
                    but to the purchaser a big profit, especially if the holder of the defaulted notes was the
                    successful bidder and could use his notes as cash in the purchase.</p>
            <p>Many attempts were made by legislators to enact laws which would enable communities to organize banks
                    and emit notes which would both enable the communities to receive the benefits of a bank of issue
                    and at the same time adequately protect holders of its notes; but in the main they were not able to
                    circumvent the schemes of the professional bank wreckers. Lack of time prevents my giving any
                    details of such legislation and the devices of the bank wreckers.</p>
            <p>A single incident, however, will sufficiently illustrate the problem and show how one bank in Indiana
                    escaped a threatened attack. I take it from the testimony of Lyman J. Gage, a distinguished banker
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> who became a secretary of the treasury in the cabinets of McKinley and Roosevelt, and
                    who was called to testify before the congressional committee on banking and currency in 1908. In
                    telling of his experience in the early days in a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> bank, he said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I remember specially being very diligently occupied for some days in sorting out the notes
                            for a particular bank until we had accumulated some $25,000 or $30,000
                            of the issue of the bank of Rushville, I believe it was, and three men with about
                            $30,000 of that money started for the bank to get these notes redeemed, or to
                            bust the bank. ∗ ∗ ∗ At the end of about three days the men
                            returned with the notes they had taken away, and explained that they had taken the
                            prescribed route; they had gone by rail to a certain place, and had taken a stage and had
                            gone to a certain other place: that thence there was no stage line over to the other place
                            where the bank was; and so they had hired a private vehicle to take them over there, but
                            they were strangers and were under suspicion and somebody smelled out the object of their
                            visit and they were informed by a committee of men that if they had come to break their bank
                            they had better start back because neither they nor their money was safe on any such kind of
                            an errand; and they prudently returned.</p>

                    granted a charter to its successor. For the purpose of protecting its citizens against the danger
                    which the existence of the new federal bank threatened, the state constitutional convention put up a
                    barrier which they believed would, and which did, prevent the location of a branch of the federal
                    bank in the state. The constitution provided as a part of the fundamental law of the state: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>There shall not be established or incorporated in this state any bank or banking company, or

                            or bearer; provided, that nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to prevent the
                            General Assembly from establishing a state bank and branches.</p>

            <p>In 1834 a state bank was chartered. The state owned one half the stock and individuals one half, all
                    of which was paid in specie. The capital was $1,600,000. The charter expired in 1855. The
                    success and popularity of the bank were such that in that year, when there were twenty branches [?]
                    in operation, it was reorganized and re chartered as the Bank of the State of Indiana. [?] That
                    there was profit in the operation of the bank is shown by the fact that after payment of the
                    principal and interest on the bonds issued to obtain the specie required to pay for its shares the
                    state realized a net profit estimated by some authorities as $2,780,-600 and by others as
                    $3,500,000. At all of its branches it did a regular banking business; the central office
                    being the administering bureau and clearing house for the branches. It had the right to issue notes
                    without putting up any bonds, to the amount of twice its capital. In writing of the great panic of
                    1857, Mr. Knox says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>No bank in the country stood higher than the state bank of Indiana during the panic. In all
                            Western and Southern states its notes commanded a premium and in the East were taken at a
                            slight discount. ∗ ∗ ∗ Its loans were made in small amounts
                            and scattered all over the entire state, thus affording the greatest possible measure of
                            relief.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The serious defect in the law authorizing the chartering of a state bank was the requirement that
                    before a new branch could be established all the other branches must consent. The result of this was
                    that many prosperous towns needing a bank were kept from getting it by the veto of the branch in a
                        <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-023-1-095"/> neighboring and rival town. When the constitutional
                    convention met in 1852 to prepare a new constitution the demand for additional banking facilities
                    throughout the state led to the insertion of the article giving the legislature power to enact a
                    general banking law. The demand was for "free" banking, and such a law was
                    enacted. The law as enacted was capable of serious abuse. Of banks organized under it Hepburn says:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Notwithstanding the strength of the State Bank of Indiana, the state was for a time the

                            banking offices or furniture. A circular letter issued offering aid to any one desiring to
                            start such a bank stated that the sole cost necessarily incurred in starting a
                            $100,000 bank would be $5,000 for plates to print the notes, and
                            expenses, including compensation to the promoter, and $5,000 as margin to carry

                    </placeName> city. Of its effect on Indiana banks it is enough to say that the Bank of the State of
                    Indiana was not affected by it. All its notes presented for payment during the panic were redeemed
                    in specie on presentation, but all the bond security banks in the state were forced to suspend
                    except two in <placeName>

                    </placeName> Bank was not luck; it was because of the wise plan adopted for its protection when it
                    was organized. The organizers and first directors were John A. Cook, of Goshen, the son of a Goshen
                    merchant, Thomas G. Harris, a lawyer, also of Goshen, and one Samuel Geisinger, probably the
                    promoter.</p>
            <p>Some of the facts I have given and knowledge of the experience of free banks in other states must
                    have been in the minds of the organizers. Obviously the danger to be avoided was a surprise attack
                    by "bank busters". The only way to avoid such attacks was to make it impossible
                    for these commercial buccaneers to catch the bank unprepared and without some notice. The plan
                    adopted consisted in locating the bank in an out of the way village and establishing a branch where
                    its business was to be done. The hamlet of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>— <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-023-1-096"/> now the village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wakarusa</settlement>
                    </placeName>—was well adapted to serve as the seat of a bank of which a branch could be
                    established in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName>; and this name was adopted. And very soon after its name was taken by the bank it was
                    abandoned by the village and a more appropriate name—its Indian name,
                    Mud-knee-deep—was adopted. The situation was probably made more complicated by the fact
                    that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the name of the county seat of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington County</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The bank was now ready for business. If men came to the Goshen office with notes to be redeemed it
                    would be necessary for them to make known their object and the amount of the notes held by them. If
                    the bank had specie sufficient to redeem them they would be redeemed. If it had not they would be
                    told that the notes would be redeemed at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Goshen manager would then perhaps be able to collect from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> merchants enough specie to add to that in his hands to redeem the notes and rush it
                    through to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> to redeem them if presented there. It was safe to assume that holders of the notes
                    would realize that the manager of the bank would make public the information they had given him and
                    would know the amount of notes in their possession and the amount of specie they would have if the
                    notes were redeemed. And they would have reason to suspect that they might be met somewhere along
                    the road by such a committee as Rushville was able to produce or waylaid by highwaymen as
                    conscienceless as themselves.</p>
            <p>As I was told these facts by men who knew; and was not told that the bank ever had presented to it
                    for redemption notes in excess of the amount it was able to redeem, I assume that the "bank
                    busting" fraternity concluded that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> Bank was not an attractive prospect, and avoided it. For thirteen years this bank
                    supplied its patrons with the money they needed and thereby contributed to the prosperity of the
                    community it served. In the ten years between 1850 and 1860 the population of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> increased from 780 to 2,053 and in the next decade to 3,138.</p>
            <p>In March 1865 congress authorized the issue of bonds to a large amount to pay obligations growing out
                    of the Civil war. And to increase the home market for them it required banks <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-023-1-097"/> of issue to deposit federal bonds as security for note issues. At the
                    same session it enacted a law laying a tax of ten per cent on all notes of state banks paid out
                    after the first day of July, 1866. While this put an end to the issue of notes by Salem Bank it did
                    not put an end to its prosperity. In 1865 John Cook, who was then the owner of the bank, sold its
                    business and good will to General Milo S. Hascall and John W. Irwin. The next year the bank was
                    moved from its location facing the east side of the courthouse square to its present location on the
                    east side of the square.</p>
            <p>Some years ago I met a gentleman who was interested in the subject of Indiana banking and who knew
                    the story of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> Bank. In talking of it I said I wished that I could get some of its canceled notes for
                    our historical society's collection. He said he thought he could get some for me; and he
                    did. They were placed in a cabinet of the society in which there was an excellent collection of
                    paper money—colonial, continental, state bank notes of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and Indiana, makeshift currency of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> towns issued to provide small change for the inhabitants,
                    "shin-plasters" of the time of the Civil war, postal currency, bills of the
                    Southern Confederacy and some rare coins of both <placeName>
                        <country>America</country>
                    </placeName> and Europe.</p>
            <p>I regret to say that because the Society lacked adequate means for preserving its objects of
                    historical interest nearly all of those I have named were clandestinely removed some years ago. As
                    they are of slight commercial value I am confident that they are being kept in some private
                    collection and I will continue to indulge the hope that they will be restored to it when the Society
                    is better prepared to receive and safely keep them.</p>
            <p>[There is some confusion of dates and banks in the above article. The Second State Bank of Indiana
                    had only 13 branches. It was entirely liquidated in 1854. The Bank of the State of Indiana took its

            <p>D<hi rend="sc">OCTOR</hi> Ryland Thomas Brown was one of the outstanding men in his day in Indiana.
                    He was an all-round scientific man, and investigation in the field of science amounted to almost a
                    passion with him. This strain must have come into his mentality through his mother's side,
                    for it was not manifested in former generations of the Brown family.</p>
            <p>The mother of Doctor Brown was Hannah John and her father, John John, and mother, Barbara Evans, were
                    both born in <placeName>
                        <country reg="wlk">Wales</country>
                    </placeName> where they were married, and emigrated to <placeName>
                        <country>America</country>
                    </placeName> in 1746, therefore were pioneers before the Revolutionary war. Hannah was born in
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Welch Neck</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>.</p>
            <p>They were remarkable for their difference in stature. Barbara Evans was a tiny creature, being less
                    than five feet in height. John John was almost a giant; he was seven feet tall, and was credited
                    with being the tallest man in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s whole army. He was a miller by trade and when the war was declared he at
                    once joined the army, and was appointed by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to be his personal miller, among other duties as a soldier. When the war ended there
                    was little or no money to pay off <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s army, and each man was given a grant of land in the "New Country"—<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and Indiana. He was with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> at the surrender of Corn-wallis at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Yorktown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and immediately on the disbanding of the army John John went to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Welch Neck</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>, where his family remained. Very soon he went to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to select a home under his land grant, and he chose it near the great <geogName>Ohio
                        river</geogName>, which furnished a readier escape from hostile savages. There he built a cabin,
                    and there he lived till his death, about 1820.</p>
            <p>George Brown, the father of Ryland T. Brown, was born in the royal colony of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, and he was of English blood. <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-023-1-099"/> It was supposed that
                    his father and mother lived for a time in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, since at that period <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> seemed the popular port for emigrants from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="enk">England</region>
                    </placeName>. This could not be substantiated. The mother of this George Brown was Mary Ball, the
                    daughter of George Washington according to a family tradition. As a mere youth he joined <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s army and saw action under him, and continued in the service until his time
                    of enlistment was up in 1780, he having enlisted in Captain Jacob Valentine's company in
                    the First <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Regiment, commanded by Colonel George Gibson. He was present at the surrender of
                    Cornwallis, and later continued in the service against the Indians, who were English allies, from
                    1780 to 1790. He too, as the rest of the army, received, a grant of land for his services and he
                    located on Cabin Creek in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Mason county</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. Here, he with his wife, Hannah John
                    Brown, set up a home in a new cabin which he built of logs, cut and hewed by himself, and here
                    Ryland Thomas Brown was born, in October 1807. It is hard to realize how great had been the
                    hardships of such a life as it had only been forty-one years since the first white man had come into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, known to the Indians as the "happy hunting ground", which all tribes
                    had enjoyed in common.</p>
            <p>When he was two years old his father moved to Cler-mont county, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, near the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and a little later a colony of staid people from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName> moved to the same settlement. Wisely they brought with them a schoolmaster, whose name
                    was Mark P. Stenchfield. As soon as their own homes were built they at once began the erection of a
                    log school house, and school began, which was probably "a loud school", popular at
                    that period, and so called because the children studied aloud so that the hum from them could be
                    heard outside distinctly. Dr. Brown was a slender, feeble boy then and his parents finding him not
                    equal to the tasks of his sturdier brothers, let him go to this school, which was kept winter and
                    summer. He was not much older than four years when he started to school, which seemed to have
                    awakened in him a desire for knowledge, for he developed early into a scholar.</p>
            <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-023-1-100"/>
            <p>In 1821 with the restlessness of the pioneer soldiery, his father moved to Indiana, and located in
                    the southern part of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Rush county</region>
                    </placeName>, in a section that had been ceded to the government by the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> Indians. It was a wild, partly developed country, and Indians still lived in that
                    vicinity, where the woods were primeval and fields had to be literally cut out from the forest.
                    Ryland Brown was only fourteen years old and now he had to exchange his school-life for the
                    hardships of a backwoods life, one which involved manual labor in place of mental application.
                    Fortunate for him were those few years under the "Yankee" schoolmaster, for he was
                    well grounded in the three "R's" if nothing else. In later life he did
                    not seem to read words but grasped the gist of sentences at a glance, for he was an insatiable
                    reader to the end of his life.</p>
            <p>When he was about seventeen years old "land hunters" began to come into that county
                    in search of land fit for settlement, or as a speculation. In these years he had lived here in the
                    midst of the great forest; he had become familiar with every foot of it; he knew its trees by the
                    bark and fruit and foliage, and the wild shrubs as well; and the medicinal value of its
                    plants—which they called weeds—he learned from his mother, who was born a
                    physician, but made a drudge by circumstance; for she had an instinct for healing, and on her fell
                    the highest of human duties, oversight of all sick women and children, as well as the sturdy men who
                    were hurt or laid low by illness; all done without money or price. Here he became so expert a
                    woodsman that when land hunters needed a guide Ryland Brown was recommended for the work and thus
                    his love of out-door life and labor was fostered till he became what now would be called a
                    naturalist. This life suited him physically as well as intellectually, and strengthened his rather
                    frail body and contributed to its development at a crucial time of life.</p>
            <p>In 1822 he united with the Baptist church, known as the "Clifty Church", when he
                    was a little over fifteen years old, this was before the "New School" had broken
                    from the Old School Baptists. Alexander Campbell who had emigrated <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-023-1-101"/> from <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName> at the close of his course in the University of Glasgow was preaching all over <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, protesting against all man-made creeds; for he had withdrawn from the Presbyterian
                    church previous to his arrival in this country. A copy of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Walker's debate fell into his hands by some chance and after reading it he
                    became a "reformer" and later withdrew from the Baptist church, which was brought
                    about by the "Flat Rock Association" having drawn up certain articles of faith
                    which they recommended for adoption for the churches in their Association. Ryland Brown, then only
                    nineteen years old, succeeded in having those articles voted down in the Clifty church, and
                    recommended the adoption of the New Testament "as an exponent of faith" for that
                    congregation. Three years later this bold procedure on his part, as one of his brethren said,
                    "caused him to be selected as the first victim in the state to be sacrificed on this altar
                    of sectarian bigotry". He was arraigned on the very general charge of being a
                    "Campbellite", and was excluded from the Baptist church (0. S.).</p>
            <p>About a year previous to this expulsion from the church, his father having died a year before, he was
                    thrown on his own resources, and he determined to enter the profession of medicine, and for the
                    following three years he devoted himself to acquiring that profession. He entered the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Medical College at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and was graduated in the spring of 1829. How he accomplished this, having no tangible
                    resources, aside from what he and his mother could make by sheer hard labor and determination to
                    accomplish this object, is not within the knowledge of his descendants. At that period farming
                    furnished a mere living; there was very little "cash in hand", barter and exchange
                    was the common method of financial transactions, and when the corn and wheat were traded for
                    absolute necessities there was little left in the purse.</p>
            <p>After his graduation he spent the greater part of the summer in hunting a suitable location in which
                    to practice his profession, meanwhile accepting such practice as offered at his home near Rushville,
                    since he was looking forward to marriage <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-023-1-102"/> in the autumn of that
                    same year. This young girl's name was Mary Reeder (she was only nineteen when she married
                    the young doctor). She was born in a little settlement east of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and both her father and mother were of Revolutionary stock, her grandfather was the
                    pioneer who was killed on the site of the fountain in that city while hoeing in his cornfield. His
                    name was Van Cleve, and he was born in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and ultimately came to the province of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he helped to found New Rochelle.</p>
            <p>At the time of her marriage to Doctor Brown her cousin, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Wright—the father of the Wright brothers—recalls her as a tall,
                    graceful young woman, with beautiful blue eyes, brown hair slightly curling, and a simple charming
                    manner which "attracted all the boys like bees to honey". Her character was as
                    beautiful as her person could have been. They were married in October following Doctor
                    Brown's graduation from the medical college. She became the most devoted of wives, and much
                    of his success was owing to her utter abnegation of self for his advancement.</p>
            <p>They, as all pioneers of that day did, lived in a cabin near a little stream, which was essential to
                    housekeeping in that day. There they remained until the summer of 1832 when they removed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> where the Doctor established a practice, and aside from professional work he continued
                    to preach the gospel as interpreted by Alexander Campbell, and was successful in both lines of work,
                    and established many churches in what was known as the White Water country. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> he preached in the courthouse, where he held a protracted meeting, with the assistance
                    of John O'Kane, which proved so successful that the outcome was the founding of the
                    Christian church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The strenuous labor of following two callings undermined his health and for a time he
                    quit medicine, and devoted himself <pb n="97" id="VAA4025-023-1-103"/> to preaching, and he was
                    appointed in June, 1842, at a state meeting held in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, "to labor in word and doctrine for the churches in Indiana". But
                    this proved too strenuous an undertaking, for it brought on hemorrhage of the lungs and he retired
                    from this work in order to regain his health.</p>
            <p>From his own knowledge as a physician he knew that outdoor work would be the best means of restoring
                    him to health, and accordingly he worked for a year in a sawmill, all the time in the open air;
                    under this heroic treatment his lungs were healed, and all symptoms of consumption overcome. (Before
                    this, however, he had been working in a "daguerreotype gallery", and thought the
                    ether used in developing pictures had much benefited him.)</p>
            <p>About this time there was a furore among people of wandering habits (who always desire to be at the
                    "opening up" of new territory) because of the richness, the fertility and the
                    opportunities of the "<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash country</region>
                    </placeName>", and there was a great hegira.</p>
            <p>Dr. Brown had much of the roving pioneer spirit, and he at once decided that that was the
                    "land of opportunity" both for himself and his family of six children, the
                    youngest a babe a few months old.</p>
            <p>The fertility of the country was unquestioned, but there was said to be a fearful form of
                    "fever and ague" which was a terrible scourge at times to the new settlers.</p>
            <p>Roads in this part of Indiana were negligible, impassable at certain seasons. Apparently, without
                    much consideration of the subject, the Doctor prepared a "big covered wagon" for
                    the journey, and stowed his children under cover upon miscellaneous household goods of absolute
                    necessity; one of the utensils was a "Dutch oven" still in the possession of a
                    member of the family.</p>
            <p>The "rush", for several years, to this <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash country</region>
                    </placeName> had been unprecedented in pioneer history, in its day comparable to the Klondyke
                    hegira, nearly three-quarters of a century later.</p>
            <p>He started on this journey in the spring of 1844, and the journey could not but have been
                    disagreeable, if like ordinary weather of that season, and the uncomfortable manner of <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-023-1-104"/> locomotion. The date on which he reached "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash town</settlement>
                    </placeName>" is not known. On his arrival there the doctor immediately procured a log
                    house, and at once set up what "lares and Penates" they had. He soon formed a
                    partnership with another physician who had lived in that town for some years, a Doctor Ford, who
                    proved to be a good friend, and who at once provided him with a few patients. Nor was it long before
                    he had them in his own family; some of the children suffered with light form of malaria. But his
                    poor wife was attacked with the worst form of "chills", the kind known as
                    "tertian ague", which greatly prostrated her. The small children were cared for by
                    the oldest son and daughter, as the others were too young to be of use. They had taken with them a
                    negro child that had been brought by the underground railroad from the Carolinas by Abolitionists,
                    to be parceled out to white families, and Doctor Brown selected her, unfortunately, for she proved
                    the most mischievous, disobedient; untrustworthy child, adding much to the cares of the mother of an
                    already large family.</p>
            <p>While they lived in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash country</region>
                    </placeName> she gave the Doctor ample proof of her power to invent and carry out mischief. One day
                    as he was returning from a call in the country, when he was crossing the bridge over the river he
                    noticed on the opposite bank three children attempting to ford the stream, as he thought. On closer
                    inspection he recognized two of his own children, and the black one as his ward, Milly. He paced his
                    horse to the place of crossing in time to save them from drowning. On asking Milly why she attempted
                    so dangerous a thing, she replied, "Ize a-crossin' the riveh Jerden wiv
                    'em".</p>
            <p>The fever did not abate along the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName>, and the Doctor was called early
                    one morning to the country to attend on new patients, victims of the prevailing malaria, a journey
                    that took most of the day to accomplish, and did not reach home till some time after dinner. He
                    found his wife in bed after a terrible chill which left her very much prostrated. Desperate, he
                    hitched the horses to his wagon, brought it to the door and picked her up bodily, feather bed and
                    all, and placed her in the wagon bed, crowded the children into it, <pb n="99" id="VAA4025-023-1-105"/> with a few necessities, and set off for Lafayette without any previous
                    plans as to where he might locate, after a stay of six weeks in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash country</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>He had not been able to collect any money due him and his funds were negligible. He was an ardent
                    Mason and on making known his plight to his Masonic brothers in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> they gave him assistance. One man—a trustee of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College—Doctor Deming, was especially helpful and a friendship grew between
                    these two that lasted through life. The family remained through the night in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> and next morning set out for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which was no inconsiderable journey, taking all things into account. Roads then were
                    mere tracks, hub-deep with mud, helped out with "corduroy", that is, rails laid
                    cross-wise over the worst mud-holes. But finally they reached the town, with a seriously sick wife,
                    six children and no prospective roof to cover their heads, and thirty-five cents in hand!</p>
            <p>Here again the Masons helped him, and found him a little house to live in, on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> street, and he invested his entire funds in a broom to clean up that house. His eldest
                    son, aged fifteen, and daughter, aged thirteen, constituted the domestic staff, and soon the house
                    was made livable. The kindness of the pioneers was then finely illustrated to "the
                    strangers within their gates", as was the general practice toward newcomers.</p>
            <p>In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Doctor Brown's fortunes slowly mended and he acquired ultimately a living
                    practice. In those days a doctor in small towns must be also a surgeon-of-sorts. He was required to
                    set bones, and pull teeth with a terrible machine called "turn-key" clamped to the
                    jaw.</p>
            <p>Then it was a creed with doctors never to refuse a call. One night very late when he was comfortably
                    in bed, Dr. Brown was roused by a man who told him that a neighbor of his would died if he did not
                    soon get treatment from him. The Doctor rose and dressed, and wound his legs in long strips of green
                    baize from toe to thigh, saddled his horse and set off, over roads deep with mud, varied with
                    puddles, on a ten-mile ride. When he reached the patient's home he found <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-023-1-106"/> him better, and the man feebly asked him, "You won't
                    charge me nothin' for this trip, will you, Doc?"</p>
            <p>The Doctor replied that he would, and the patient said, "‘Well then,
                    you've got to give me some medicine!"</p>
            <p>The Doctor accommodated him and gave him an old-fashioned remedy used in what they called then
                    "cramp colic", which made him retch during what was left of the night. Meantime
                    the Doctor was plodding home, finishing his twenty-mile ride by daylight. Later his patient met him
                    and told him he'd "never had anything that had done him as much good."</p>
            <p>During those distressful six weeks in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash country</region>
                    </placeName> he had had a unique case of surgery. One day a young man called on him in great
                    trouble, for the girl he loved would not marry him because he had one leg that was bowed, while the
                    other was straight. He asked the doctor if he could straighten it, and he replied that he could if
                    he would undergo an operation. The youth consented; for the girl promised to marry him if he could
                    get it straightened. The doctor calculated to a nicety the size of the wedge that would be necessary
                    to cut out of the bone to straighten the curve, and the youth submitted to the operation, which was
                    a success in every way—but one. The girl married another man while the bone was knitting!
                    The doctor had akeen sense of humor, and he never failed to laugh when he recalled that incident.</p>
            <p>In those days doctors were not collectors of fees—in money at least—they were
                    mostly paid in apples, potatoes and "firewood", which were not "first
                    choice" at that; they served, however, in the domestic department.</p>
            <p>This move to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a fortunate one, for he gradually built up a practice, and ultimately bought him a
                    home, on the outer bounds of the town at that time. He had about an acre and a half of ground, and
                    he kept a cow, and since his practice had grown and roads had not improved, was obliged to have four
                    horses.</p>
            <p>His mind and body were so active that he never could find time to waste. He began to use the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College library, with an object in view; he kept faithfully reading for four <pb n="101" id="VAA4025-023-1-107"/> years when he attained it and was given the degree of Master of
                    Arts in 1850, under Dr. White, the president of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College. Meantime he not only practiced medicine but did field work in geology, there
                    being a famous crinoid bed located about a mile north of the town, on the bank of the creek, which
                    was one of the two most famous beds in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. He delved there very possibly, with Professor Hovey, who taught geology in the
                    college. Sometimes he found complete specimens, body and tentacles attached to the bluish stone of
                    the shale bed. He acquired his knowledge of geology by reading on this subject and applying it in a
                    practical way. His mind was avid for all kinds of knowledge. In 1854 he was appointed state
                    geologist by Governor Joseph S. Wright, the Democratic governor, although he was a
                    "Whig" and the only one in his family.</p>
            <p>It was during the sitting of the Democratic convention that nominated Polk for President that the
                    first message ever sent by electricity was sent which considered it as a fraud. Doctor
                    Brown's brother William was an active campaigner for Polk, and came out strongly in the
                    rural district opposing the use of electricity, inspired thereto because Morse was seeking help from
                    the government to carry out his designs. William Brown declared passionately that if it were run
                    through their fields on wires it would kill all their horses and cattle, it would burn down their
                    houses, barns, and rail fences, and was so convincing that he defeated the opposing candidate for
                    governor of Indiana, no less person than General Wallace's father, [?] and helped set Polk
                    in the White House. Ultimately he became Assistant Secretary of State.</p>
            <p>Doctor Ryland Brown was accredited with opening the first coal mine in Indiana. This has since been
                    disputed, but it is known that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Government sent him to Newfoundland to learn the method of mining it used there.</p>
            <p>During his tenure of office he toured nearly the whole state on foot, and he located the
                    "Glacial Drift" (boulders) from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the northeast corner of the state, and thoroughly informed himself of the various
                    kinds of soil, rich black loam of the central prairies, silicate deposits of the extreme south <pb n="102" id="VAA4025-023-1-108"/> used in making glass, clays adapted for both fine and coarse
                    pottery, besides fields on which magnificent corn and wheat were grown, he even located peat beds.</p>
            <p>On Indiana's southern hills looming above the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> a colony of
                    Swiss planted great vineyards and made wine from them. There were still great forests in the state
                    at that time, 1854, with a wonderful variety of trees. The Indiana hickory, strong as steel,
                    furnished the farmer and the wagon-maker material for the heavy wagons used in labor. The Indiana
                    walnut, with its towering trunks, was put to the uses of rail-making by the pioneers to enclose
                    their fields, for fuel for their home fires, also for building their cabins. Now among manufacturers
                    of furniture Indiana walnut takes the highest place, because of its satiny texture in the finished
                    article, but the trees of great girth have become so rare that its price has become almost
                    prohibitive. All these trees came under Doctor Brown's inspection at this time, not in the
                    line of duty especially, but because he loved nature.</p>
            <p>The chair of Natural Sciences in Northwestern Christian University (now Butler) being vacant Doctor
                    Brown was selected to fill it, consequently in August, 1858, he removed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and at the opening of the term in September began his duties, teaching geology,
                    chemistry, and physiology. He instructed by lectures, experiments, and quizzes, which searched to
                    the very bottom of the student's knowledge, nor could they deceive him with trumped-up
                    excuses for failures in class and brusquely exposed the fallacies. He could always make his lectures
                    heard because of his own enthusiasm for his subject. When it became known that he was a good chemist
                    he was called upon in cases of murder, by poisoning, to examine the stomachs of the victims, and in
                    two heinous cases—if no more—the verdict of guilty was rendered.</p>
            <p>For many years Doctor Brown occupied this position and made the study of Natural Sciences popular. He
                    was superseded by the son of Ovid Butler, formerly a student under him. During the Civil War he
                    occupied himself in the practice of medicine and preaching, and in chemical investigations for
                    others, and lecturng.</p>
            <pb n="103" id="VAA4025-023-1-109"/>
            <p>Doctor Brown was intensely loyal during the Civil War, and as a personal friend of Governor Morton
                    upheld him in his efforts to keep the state loyal, threatened as she was by the Knights of the
                    Golden Circle and the irregular Confederate cavalry under John Morgan, who really succeeded in
                    raiding the southern counties of the state, but hard pressed by Morton's troops galloping
                    behind, were driven out of the state.</p>
            <p>The university was then outside the city limits, and, with the exception of half a dozen houses there
                    was a great common east of Doctor Brown's house, and a camp for the training of raw
                    recruits was established there. Since he kept cows it became a habit of his to carry a great bucket
                    of butter-milk, fresh from the churn, down to a tree on the northern bounds of this camp, and to
                    dispense it with tin dippers. This soon became known among the soldiers, and as soon as they saw him
                    post himself they gathered round him like a lot of school boys. He was known among them as
                    "the butter-milk man". Not only that, but they would come to him in sickness for
                    treatment, which was "given without money and without price". One young sick boy
                    was taken into his home and nursed by his wife till he recovered.</p>
            <p>He was always an Abolitionist, and, while in Crawfords-ville, had been a worker for the
                    "Underground Railroad", and as the war proceeded he looked forward to the
                    destruction of slavery as one of its results. And when <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lincoln</region>
                    </placeName> set the slaves free no one rejoiced more fervently than he that this stain on the honor
                    of our country was forever washed out.</p>
            <p>A few years after the war closed Doctor Brown was appointed a lecturer on chemistry in the Medical
                    Department of the State University, which was located in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and continued in it for some time. He is still remembered on account of his unique
                    illustration of certain points in his lectures. No child was fonder of candy than Doctor Brown and a
                    class of his students at the close of the term presented him with a "candy cane"
                    of red and white stripes, the diameter being nearly two inches, and its length that of an ordinary
                    cane. The presentation speech created much hilarity, and the <pb n="104" id="VAA4025-023-1-110"/>
                    Doctor accepted it in like manner. This cane weighed seven pounds.</p>
            <p>In 1871 Doctor Brown was appointed by President Garfield Chief Chemist of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Accustomed to an active life the close confinement in an office wearied him, and
                    finally became so irksome that he resigned, and was succeeded by his former pupil at Northwestern
                    University, Professor Harvey Wiley, who remained there many years with honor and success.</p>
            <p>Doctor Brown returned to his home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and took up again his former avocations, medicine, preaching and writing. He never
                    accepted a call to a church which required him to take up residence where it was located, as far as
                    is known. He preached "by appointment" in two small towns, not far from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, on alternate Sundays, but never took upon himself the responsibilities of a resident
                    pastor. One of these towns was Zionsville, and one cloudy winter day when he was preaching there, in
                    the midst of the sermon he stopped abruptly and said conversationally, "Why its
                    snowing!" and proceeded without a pause, unconscious that he had spoken, he was very
                    absent-minded.</p>
            <p>He continued to preach to the end of his life, and his last sermon was delivered on the Easter Sunday
                    before he died, and was remarkable for its beauty of diction and fervent expression of his Christian
                    faith.</p>
            <p>Always bitterly opposed to drunkenness, he never used whiskey nor brandy in his practice, and when
                    Prohibition became a political issue, for the first time, he affiliated with that party. He regarded
                    drunkenness from a scientific standpoint as well as from a moral—ruin to both the
                    physical and moral man. He wrote and lectured constantly on that subject, and by many people he was
                    considered fanatical. However he was consistent in his belief, and among his five sons there was not
                    a drunkard.</p>
            <p>Doctor Brown was preeminently a horticulturalist, and wherever he made his home he planted fruit
                    trees and grapevines, and had a flourishing kitchen-garden, in which he took as much pride as a
                    landscape gardener could at his highest achievements. The results of his labor justifies his pride
                    for <pb n="105" id="VAA4025-023-1-111"/> his gardens supplied his table with
                    "vitamines", and the like, till frost bit the last tomato vine.</p>
            <p>He was no less familiar with the trees and shrubs of Indiana than with his kitchen garden, he knew
                    the names of all and their peculiar uses, as well as he knew his kitchen garden. When the Centennial
                    Exposition was held in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> he was the head of that department in which the different varieties of wood were
                    exhibited, indigenous to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. He was always an early riser, and one morning went out to the Exposition Grounds at
                    seven o'clock. He was soon joined by a stranger who conversed with him very intelligently
                    about the uses of the various kinds of wood on exhibition. The man was interested more in hickory
                    than in the other woods and wanted to know what uses it could be put to.</p>
            <p>Doctor Brown named a long list of uses, and handed him <hi rend="b">a</hi> piece of hickory and asked
                    him to break it, which he was unable to do. The man then introduced himself as Dom Pedro, the
                    Emperor of <placeName>
                        <country reg="bl">Brazil</country>
                    </placeName>, and declared that he would like to introduce hickory into his own dominion. He came
                    back many times at an early hour, always alone, and Doctor Brown gave him much information, and they
                    became quite friendly.</p>
            <p>Doctor Brown never lacked for occupation. In 1872 he wrote and published a concise Physiology for
                    schools and it was used extensively in the public schools of Indiana. Aside from that he wrote and
                    published many pamphlets on scientific and religious themes. He was engaged by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> school board to deliver a series uf lectures to the teachers in the higher grades. He
                    spoke simply and clearly, elaborating his chosen theme in an original and entertaining manner,
                    suited to his auditors, not familiar with the subject.</p>
            <p>The last months of his life he was employed in an editorial capacity on an agricultural paper and
                    wrote on scientific subjects apropos to farming, more especially grains and fruits for which he had
                    always a deep interest, and a profound knowledge.</p>
            <p>No man ever led a fuller life than Doctor Brown, and he furnished proof that work will not kill a
                    man. He was not a big muscular man, but one of medium height and slight <pb n="106" id="VAA4025-023-1-112"/> physique, with tremendous nervous force. His hair and beard were red in
                    youth but by the time he reached forty years they were white. His eyes were blue and keen, his
                    complexion very fair, but withal he was a homely man. He was frank to brusqueness in expressing his
                    opinions, though he was not ill-tempered nor unkindly, nor was he diffusely affectionate. It may
                    truly be said of him that he was far above the average man both morally and intellectually. He was a
                    purist in morals and hated the vulgar word and deed.</p>
            <p>In 1890 the last week in April he was stricken with the "grip" at the age of
                    eighty-three years, and died the third day of May. During this time he watched his own case as if he
                    were a patient, and came to the conclusion that grip, for the most part affected the nervous system,
                    and, that if he recovered, he would treat it from that standpoint.</p>
            <p>Shortly after his death, Doctor Fletcher, the medical head of the Indiana Insane Hospital, pronounced
                    a eulogy upon Doctor Brown, who had formerly been his preceptor, and in the course of his remarks he
                    made the statement that he had heard Doctor Brown give, as his belief, that diseases were
                    transmitted by germs, and that a time would come when this theory would be accepted throughout the
                    medical profession as the truth. And further, that this theory had been advanced by Doctor Brown
                    some years before a German scientist announced publicly that this new germ theory had been
                    thoroughly proven to be a fact.</p>
            <p>One of his fellow-professors in the University said of him, "His mind was of the highest
                    order—clear, logical, comprehensive, and of an eminently practical cast. He was naturally
                    a naturalist, possessing superior faculties, combined with extraordinary powers of analysis and
                    classification. ∗ ∗ ∗ His scholarship partakes largely of his mind.
                    ∗ ∗ ∗ In his department of Natural Science he seems almost
                    omnicient."</p>
            <p>He began preaching in the church of his choice—the Christian Church, as founded by
                    Alexander Campbell—when he was nineteen years old and his last sermon was delivered at
                    the age of eighty-three. His religion had no trace of hysteria, either in deed or discourse and he
                    was a consistent Christian to the day of his death, and it may be well said of him he "was
                    a workman that needeth not to be ashamed."</p>

            <p>This is a story of the North American Indians with the Kickapoos on the stage a large part of the
                    time. The Indians are a group of brave people fighting a losing fight. They are driven westward from
                    their present homeland, The author has endeavored to set forth the inspiring worthiness of the
                    Indians. He uses "Little Bear," a Kickapoo Boy of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, as the hero and places him in the care of Wm. H. Harrison, who takes the place of
                    Little Bear's father who was killed by Lean Dog, a very close friend.</p>
            <p>Stories of the Indians, of their modes of life, of their homes, of their pleasures, of their sorrows,
                    of their religion, of their superstition, of their social life—these have been told in a
                    clear and interesting style. The vivid contrasts among the various tribes of Indians are handled in
                    a clear manner. The author lays many historical scenes and names some geographical sites of note.
                    Mr. Barce brings out the likeness in spirit between the Whites and the Indians, the change from the
                    tribal form of government to a democratic form of government, the horrors of liquor and how the
                    civilized people are getting away from the use of it, how intermarriage between the Whites and the
                    Indians are not approved by the Indians. The following shows the advancement in thought of the
                    younger generation of Indians, "Father, when mercy fails and deeds of love, all must fail.
                    This the Red Fox told me long ago. To war is useless. All must be brothers, or all destroyed. The
                    Great Spirit has said it and it is so."</p>
            <p>It is by no means easy to get so much interesting material in one small book and still keep clear on
                    content, yet Attorney Barce has done this well.</p>

            <p>This is a story of the cowboy from early times, paying most attention, however, to the American
                    cowboy as he appeared in the West and as he is interpreted by the writers and moving picture shows
                    of today.</p>
            <p>There are many books written upon this subject, most of which the author has reviewed. Some few he
                    thinks good but most of them have been adversely influenced by the movies.</p>
            <p>The best part of the book and it alone justifies the existence of the book, is the latter half, which
                    points out the effect of the cowboy upon modern life and shows the differences between the real
                    cowboy and that of fiction.</p>
            <p>On the whole the book is well written and may help to stem the tide that threatens to carry away

                    are characteristic of cowboy life. The author goes into minute detail and it is a valuable addition

                    covering the period from 1865 to the present. The first chapter deals with Reconstruction after the
                    Civil War. <placeName>

                    to fifteen, inclusive, the author has attempted to solve the recent problems of the state by doing
                    as most all other historians have done; that is, by a discussion <pb n="110" id="VAA4025-023-1-116"/> of the regime of different governors. Any one especially interested in <placeName>

            <p>The appendices are interesting and instructive. In these the author has endeavored to explain in
                    detail some of the more important episodes in the later development of the state. Appendix fourteen,
                    The Pine Timber Investigation, gives the reader an insight into the peculiar manner by which the

                    </placeName>, Indiana, by one of its leading citizens, Elmore Barce, an attorney of Fowler. While
                    the title is somewhat misleading, and the work is distinctly more literary than historical, the
                    author has attempted a very worthy purpose; namely, a contribution to his own county. Since he could
                    scarcely hope for its circulation very far beyond the limits of the county, the work evidently is
                    not undertaken primarily for profit.</p>
            <p>The first part of the volume is pure history, cleverly written in a unique and individual style, with
                    acknowledgment and reference to source material throughout; the latter part is a picturesque
                    treatise of the early agricultural development of the county. As the work progresses the author
                    apparently has some trouble in staying with his avowed purpose, at times approaching the sentimental
                    and the dramatics; for example, in the dialogue between Annie Ellsworth and Professor Morse.</p>
            <p>In general, the work is a sympathetic treatment of the subject by one who is singularly fitted for
                    the task, and the writer heartily recommends the little volume to every reader in <placeName>

                    made the hero entirely too honorable. Mr. James was quite too strong-minded to be such a weak

                    </placeName>. The story finds its place in the history of the reorganization of the northwest
                    frontier after the War of 1812. The government had taken some feeble steps toward a military
                    occupation of the northern <geogName>Mississippi valley</geogName> prior to that war but these were

                    trading center it played a leading part from about 1812 down to the Civil War. It was the Scene of
                    some important Indian conferences and was at the seat of activities during the Black Hawk War. The

            <p>This is one of a number of pamphlets prepared by various authors to meet the requirements of an
                    Indiana law of 1924, requiring the state constitution to be taught in the grades. This pamphlet
                    seems about as good or perhaps one should say about as bad or no worse than the others. Only a
                    trifling outline of a state's history can be presented in 30 or 40 pages. One's
                    state history or state government ought not be made even to appear as a trifle either to teacher or
                    pupil. No writer in such limits can show connection, sequence or development; the teacher is perhaps
                    more helpless. To call such gossip history either in book or school room is dangerous. It would be
                    far better to leave our state history entirely out of the curriculum.</p>
            <p>In a revision the author of the above pamphlet should go over his "Explanation of
                    Terms" carefully. Such words as Probate, Prosecute, Incipient, State Seal, Registration,
                    etc., have various meanings. On page 88 one is liable to get the impression that men only vote.
                    There were a number of "New Purchases". The deportation of the Pottawattomies was
                    in the hands of one of the finest citizens Indiana has ever had, and incidentally one of the best
                    friends of the Indians.</p>
