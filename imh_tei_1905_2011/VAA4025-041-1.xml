            <p>Census lists for later years and memoirs by persons who visited the Illinois Country, gave
                    considerably different pictures of the population of the region. The official lists, such as the one
                    taken by Macarty in 1752, which can be checked against the parish registers and other sources for
                    the names of persons living there in that year, were always incomplete. On the other hand, figures

                    over 1,500 persons generally residing in the area and possibly about that number of negroes. At the

            <p>Local governmental affairs were in the hands of the royal notary, an official appointed from among
                    the habitants by the commandant or the chief clerk, and the syndics, elected by the habitants each
                    year and charged with such duties as keeping the fence about the commons in repair. As in all such

                    Most of the houses were built of logs, but of logs set upright in the ground or upon stone

                    porch, and in some cases there were not inside doors at all between two adjoining rooms. Sometimes
                    there was a second floor, and in a few cases, where the houses were built of stone, there were

            <p>Their houses varied little in style of architecture, and inside—until the latter days of
                    the French regime, the houses of the wealthier merchants looked much like the homes of the poorer
                        <hi rend="i">voyageurs.</hi> What difference there was came as much from the difference in
                    quantity as from quality.</p>
            <p>The inventories, carefully drawn up by the notary and the priest within a few hours after the death
                    of a person, or upon the dissolution of a partnership give one an excel-: lent idea of the kind of
                    homes these French had and the clothes they wore, and even, though we get it by inference, the life
                    they led.</p>
            <p>The kitchen, center of family life, was generally the only room that was heated unless the chimney
                    was a double one in the middle of the house. On the hearth under the mantle stood the iron firedogs
                    with their curved heads, the indispensable pothook, and the spit. Arranged nearby were the iron
                    grill, the frying pans and pipkins, the copper and iron boilers and cauldrons.</p>
            <p>On the mantle, to use when the fire was low, stood crude iron lamps like the Betsey lamps of the
                    American pioneers, lamps whose shape had changed little since Roman times. There were copper and
                    wood candlesticks for holding the long tallow candles, and sometimes a pair of snuffers. On special
                    occasions the habitant burned slender candles made from the fine wax of the candleberry myrtle of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>. There were iron lanterns with pointed caps standing on the mantlepiece also, for use
                    outside at night. " And on pegs above the mantle rested the habitant's best guns;
                    the powder horn, sometimes banded with silver, hung close by.</p>
            <p>Probably in the middle of the room was a long, rectangular table made of walnut or oak from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> forests. On the high sideboard or buffet at the side of the room the housewife
                    displayed her pewter and crockery. Pewter <pb n="11" id="VAA4025-041-1-015"/> dishes were common;
                    and the earthenware plates, created especially for the peasant classes, with their flowers, their
                    cocks and their human figures all painted in stiff colors on a brilliant enamel<hi rend="sup">37</hi> gave a gay aspect to the somber room. Glass tableware was rare, and yet there were
                    habitants who owned crystal, and silver, and even one or two gold goblets. Some had silver cups and
                    bowls; spoons were sometimes of silver, more often of pewter. Forks were usually of steel or iron;
                    table knives were not common—the habitant used his hunting knife. For covering the table
                    there were linen and cotton cloths, both plain and embroidered, with napkins of the same
                        materials.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most valuable piece of furniture in the house was the bed; in the Illinois Country it was
                    frequently the only dowry of the bride, and its ownership by the survivor of the pair was assured by
                    the marriage contract. Six feet or so square, the bed was furnished with a straw mattress and a
                    thick feather bed—in better homes—and curtained with hangings of green or red
                    serge, or very rarely, of fine painted stuffs. Buffalo hides and coarse wool blankets served for
                    covers; counterpanes were of calico and sometimes of finer, flowered materials.</p>
            <p>A chest or so in the bedrooms and an <hi rend="i">armoire</hi> or wardrobe completed the furnishings

                    wide and with as many as thirty-six shelves. Made like most of the other furniture, of walnut, or
                    perhaps of black poplar or cherry, it had two long, hinged doors, and served as a closet for storing
                    clothing and other household goods.</p>
            <p>There were other items which were more luxuries than necessities. Most families possessed mirrors <hi rend="i">"a la toilette"</hi>; a few owned larger, framed mirrors. There is no

                    yet there must have been some owned perhaps by the priests and the officers, since many documents
                    contain references to exact hours of the day. But <list type="footnotes">

                    of the meanderings of the rivers, where one farm of two arpents front might contain only ninety

                    </placeName> in 1710 was being used by the habitant's descendants a century later. The
                    harrow was a triangular affair of wood, its two long sides each about six feet in length, while the
                    third was about four feet; its teeth, also of wood, were about five inches long. Harvesting was
                    accomplished with scythe and sickle, threshing with a wooden flail.</p>
            <p>The habitant never fertilized his fields, tilled them carelessly, frequently lost entire crops by
                    flood or drouth, and still produced enough grain year after year to send large quantities down the
                    river to the settlements of lower <placeName>

            <p>Wheat and maize were the principal grains raised. Wheat grew easily on the fertile bottom land, but
                    the yield was far below that for Indian corn. Writing in 1752, Father Louis Vivier, the priest of
                    the village, reported that while as a rule wheat yielded only five to eightfold, maize
                    "yields a thousandfold." The fogs, sudden heats, and indifferent cultivation which
                    the Jesuit blamed for the poor wheat crops apparently had no harmful effects on the maize, and the
                    country produced three times as much food as it could use.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

            <p>Cattle were kept by the habitant to draw his plow and his two-wheeled carts and to supply him with
                    meat and milk. They were undoubtedly the most useful animals he owned, and poor indeed was the

            <p>Most of the habitants seem also to have owned horses. By the same census of 1752, of the 519 horses

            <p>They were hard, adventurous men—none other would have dared trust their lives in the long,
                    narrow pirogues fashioned from cypress or cedar logs forty feet long and no more than three or four
                    feet wide. The bigger pirogues carried thirty men; their freight capacity varied from one to fifty

            <p>Batteaux were the craft used by the government and the richer merchants to carry goods. Larger than
                    the pirogues, and built of several pieces of timber, they were flat-bottomed and pointed bow and
                    stern. One end was covered with hoops of cloth for protecting the stores. They carried sails, and
                    when the wind was unfavorable, they were oared or poled; after 1750 cordelling or towing came into
                    common use for the heaviest ones.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> Their sizes varied considerably. In 1737 the

            <p>The best time to leave Kaskaskia was about February 1 when the water was high and the current flowing
                    at the rate of five miles an hour; then too the land on both sides was flooded and the Indians were
                    hunting. Going downstream then was a short journey of from twelve to twenty days. Returning in the
                    autumn was a different story. Against the current the best crews made only six or seven leagues
                    rowing from dawn to dusk. Indian attacks were frequent, and many a convoy was caught by the ice and
                    forced to winter en route, usually at the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>

            <p>The convoys were under the command of a French officer who was allowed to carry a certain amount of
                    freight free as a kind of bonus. There were frequent reports that he abused this privilege, carrying
                    so much of his own that there was little room for the king's goods. Often too, when the
                    goods were checked upon their arrival at <placeName>

            <p>Many factors stimulated the growth of towns and villages in the five states which were carved out of
                    the Old Northwest–<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. Among these factors may be noted the presence of French settlements, locations on
                    important waterways, need for local marketing centers, natural resources, the establishment of land
                    offices and state capitals, the formation of educational, religious, and health centers, and finally
                    the rise of manufactures. A large portion of this development took place in the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> because that state had reached a much greater nonrural development than the other parts
                    of the Old Northwest. This is indicated in part by the fact that in 1810, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s population was five and five-eighths times as great as that of the rest of
                    the Old Northwest; in 1820, two and three-fourths as great; and in 1840, it still was more populous
                    than all the rest of the region.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>In the present discussion, limitations of space will restrict the analysis of town and village life
                    in the Northwest to a consideration of the principal reasons for the founding and development of the
                    various communities. In the case of individual communities, many of them necessarily fall into more
                    than one category.</p>
            <p>In the first place, there were the towns which were a legacy of the French regime, places like <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Cahokia in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

                    </placeName>. Of these, at the end of the pioneer period (1850), <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> alone was of primary importance, with a population of 21,019, although <placeName>

            <p>A second reason for the location of some of the towns of the Northwest was a favorable position on an
                    important river. That had accounted for the continued significance of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, which even in 1830 had 2,222 people and in 1840, 9,102. Associated with the
                    advantageous river location, for some years the proximity of a fort or stockade as security in case
                    of Indian attack had been imperative. Thus, Marietta, settled in 1788 as the first authorized

                    </placeName>, Alton had experienced great development as a commercial center from 1830 to 1840, and
                    during the 1840's it continued as the leading market town of the state.</p>
            <p>Some towns grew up similarly as commercial centers on the less important rivers. In the first half of
                    the nineteenth century, before the period of rapid drainage, rivers maintained a much steadier level
                    than in later years. Thus, the Muskingum was considered to be navigable to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Zanesville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and even to <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Ottawa</settlement>
                    </placeName>. During the 1830 season, steamers went up the river to Peoria.</p>
            <p>A third factor in the development of villages and towns in the Old Northwest was the need for local
                    villages and market towns in the interior. During a period when local roads were wretched, little
                    villages in the forest arose almost with the cultivation of the first farms, in order to take care
                    of necessary demands of the countryside. There would be found a store or two, a flourmill, a
                    blacksmith shop, and perhaps a few dwellings. As early as 1709 in a petition to Congress, pioneers
                    in the Miami Valley described such a process of settlement. They stated in part.</p>

            <p>Similarly, larger communities developed as interior market towns for a considerable area. To these,
                    local traders brought the products of the countryside and received in exchange goods which many
                    times had been brought from afar. In <placeName>

            <p>In the fourth place, some towns developed because of special natural resources to be found in the

                    </placeName>, due largely to certain natural advantages. Important saltworks were located in the
                    vicinity, and the water power near at hand was conducive to cheap manufacturing processes. Already
                    the clays in that region were being used in manufacturing, and in 1840, of the ninety-nine potteries
                    in the state, twenty-two of them were located in <placeName>

            <p>The presence of "decomposable pyrites" in the vicinity of Steubenville permitted
                    the manufacture of copperas at that place in large quantities, and by the late 'forties there were
                    seven copperas establishments in the vicinity of that city. Likewise the gypsum found near Port

                    was rather unstable in population, for the miners came there to work during the summer and left

            <p>A large number of towns owed their origin to the speculative interest of the town founders. Sometimes
                    the city-builders considered matters of natural location and resources, but the initiative of
                    individuals often contributed to the development of one community rather than another which
                    possessed an equally advantageous natural location. Some of the proposed towns of course never
                    became more than villages on paper.</p>

                    post office and county seat. A sawmill, gristmill, and a store followed soon afterwards; but the
                    place became relatively less important when the county seat was transferred to Adrian in 1838.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

                    new county seats that territorial governor St. Clair felt impelled to veto a number of laws

            <p>A few villages were well-known at the time as health and recreational resorts. These included Yellow

                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>

                    </placeName>), the latter the seat of a widely patronized Sulphur Springs.</p>
            <p>Few if any places were founded as manufacturing villages, but a favorable location for water power or
                    mineral supplies and accessible markets contributed to the development of many a village or town. In
                    pioneer days, much manufacturing was done on a local scale in small shops. Thus, Giles Richards, a
                    brother-in-law of Amos A. Lawrence, operated at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Colerain</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a small village sixteen miles northwest of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a number of industries from 1822 to 1835. These included a cotton-mill, a flourmill, a
                    fulling and carding establishment, and sawmill, as well as a store, a tavern, and a dyehouse.
                    Farmers took the wool from their own sheep to the village mill to be twisted into yarn and perhaps
                    made into cloth.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Especially before 1840 there was much local manufacturing to meet the needs of an immediate vicinity.
                    This is illustrated in the case of the village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Granville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Licking County. There, manufacturing establishments like an iron furnace and a
                    flourmill had been in operation before 1825. Ten articles made from metal brought from <placeName>

                    clocks, selling at first for fifteen dollars. A hat factory (1828), a cast-iron plow works (1831), a
                    cheese factory (1833), a furniture establishment (1835), and shops producing brushes, boots, shoes,

                    </placeName> countryside, often with a common in the center and a Congregational or Presbyterian
                    church nearby. Here lived persons interested in trade and the professions and in the agricultural
                    activity of the township. Not uncharacteristic of these towns was Painesville which was described by
                    a visitor in 1846: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    power and the ease of shipment by canal. The cotton factories employed mostly boys and girls. By
                    1850, other industrial units there included five oil mills which purchased from the neighboring

                            of the existence of slavery, manufactures cannot be carried on. Most of these articles are
                            of ordinary quality; the furniture, for instance, is rarely such as would be approved by
                            Parisian taste, but it is cheap and neat, just what is wanted in a new country, where, with
                            the exception of a part of the South, there is a general ease and but little wealth.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

                    boots, shoes, and ready-made clothing. By 1851, ready-made clothing workers in <placeName>

                    their homes. It was also in 1850 the greatest distilling center in the world. And the future seemed
                    bright indeed. Horace Greeley after a visit there in 1850, exclaimed: <quote rend="blockquote">

            </byline>
            <p>An analysis of the sermons preached immediately after Lincoln's assassination discloses that
                    the religious sects— or at least the pastors—reacted in a way peculiar to
                    their creed. Some churches were vindictive, blaming Lincoln's assassination on the whole
                    South, crying for vengeance. Others pleaded for understanding and tolerance.</p>
            <p>It is easy to assume that the churches reflected the politics of their geographical
                    locations—with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> the fountain head of bile. This, however, was not the case. Most of the churches
                    represented a point of view at variance with that of the community–a denominational slant
                    which theological psychologists might enjoy explaining.</p>
            <p>The circumstances of Lincoln's assassination were perfect for evangelic appeal, and the
                    records provide unique material for investigation. Lincoln was shot on Good Friday,
                    Christ's Day. Ministers all over the Union had time to prepare special sermons for the
                    following Sunday. The North, in a state of ecstacy over the recent surrender of Robert E. Lee at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was shocked to hysteria by the tragic news. Supreme happiness and supreme sorrow,
                    dramatically superimposed, created an emotional excitement unparalleled in American history.
                    Congregations everywhere assembled in church to hear their own incoherent anger expressed suitably
                    by the pastor. Ministers recognized the responsibility and accepted the challenge.</p>
            <p>In Civil War days it was customary for the church elders to compliment the minister by publishing an
                    unusual sermon in pamphlet form for the congregation. Four hundred and four of Lincoln's
                    funeral sermons have been preserved, and it seems reasonable to assume that each one represented the
                    majority opinion of the congregation that published it. To determine the attitude of each sect, all
                    the published discourses were analyzed. The first task of the analyst was to separate the vindictive
                    and tolerant sermons. This is not so complicated as it sounds. True, there are degrees of tolerance
                    and vindictiveness. Some sermons are hard to classify, but the doubtful cases are surprisingly few.
                    Preachers of that day had little hesitancy in distinguishing right from wrong. Before drawing the
                    conclusions <pb n="32" id="VAA4025-041-1-036"/> set out below, ten per cent of the
                    sermons—questionable cases—were withdrawn. The remaining ninety per cent
                    displayed their colors in no uncertain terms. Can there be any question about the attitude of the
                    Reverend Henry Darling toward the South when he told his Presbyterian pastorate in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> that such a depraved assassin as Booth could not have ripened in any but the congenial
                    Southern soil? It is equally certain that the Reverend Daniel Rice felt the same way toward the
                    dying Confederacy when he told his congregation that the catastrophe was God's way of
                    goading the people to vengeance. The Reverend T. M. Hopkins of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, may be assumed to have been vindictive when he told his church that the

                    <pb n="34" id="VAA4025-041-1-038"/> Reformation seems to have still run in the chancels of certain
                    churches. Heading the list of vindictiveness toward the Confederacy, the Unitarians'
                    collection of published sermons show 80 per cent to have been unrelentingly opposed to any clemency
                    for the conquered South. The Lutheran and Congregational sermons were 75 per cent and 74 per cent
                    vindictive. Next came the Presbyterians with 62 per cent. The Episcopalians, Methodists, and
                    Baptists were evenly split, fifty-fifty, for and against lenient reconstruction, if the sermons that
                    have survived may be used as an index. The Hebrews, Catholics, and Quakers stood aloof from the
                    political imbroglio, publishing few sermons on the subject. Those that are preserved breathe
                    condolence without vituperation.</p>
            <p>These conclusions may be attacked on the ground that the Unitarians and Congregationalists
                    predominated in <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName>, hot-plate for abolitionism. Could not the high voltage vindictiveness in these
                    churches be attributed to environment? No! A survey of sermon-vindictiveness shows <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to have led all the rest, but the majority of the Unitarian sermons did not come from
                    these two states. Also it is noticeable that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> were the most tolerant states according to all the sermons from these areas, yet most
                    of the Lutheran and Presbyterian sermons came from here. Indeed, it took the combined tolerance of
                    all the other sects to offset the vengeful attitude of these two churches and give the states a
                    tolerant rating. Of the four ranking churches, then, only one—the
                    Congregational—acted in conformity with its environment. Three out of the four did not.
                    Certainly denominational attitudes did not conform to geographical and political boundaries on the
                    question of harsh reconstruction of the South.</p>
            <p>These conclusions must be taken with some reservations. Perhaps three hundred and sixty-four sermons
                    are not sufficient for a fair sample of all the churches in the Northern states. Then, too, the
                    sermons analyzed may have conformed to the politics of the local precincts in which the churches
                    were located, and at the same time been at variance with the politics of the larger state areas. In
                    all the vindictive sermons there is a noticeable flavor of opportunism rationalized as morality.
                    Lincoln, it will be remembered, was <pb n="35" id="VAA4025-041-1-039"/> elected the second time by a
                    coalition of Republicans and Union Democrats. The two wings were quarreling for mastery of the party
                    at the time of his death. With reason the Republican wing realized that they could get no majority
                    at the polls if the Democratic South was readmitted to the Union with a restored right to vote. Not
                    only must Southern Democrats be disfranchised, but the Negro vote also must be attained in order to
                    hold a safe majority. The Democratic wing of the party, on the other hand, hoped to vanquish their
                    radical colleagues by re-enfranchising the Southern Democrats who had seceded from the Union.
                    Lincoln's death at the hands of a Southern fanatic gave the radicals an advantage. Surely
                    the people would not agree to re-enfranchise the murderers of the President! As the Reverend Henry
                    E. Parker told his congregation in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Concord</settlement>

                    any quarter for the falling cause of the confederacy." Another Congregationalist, the

                  <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>, <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
               </placeName>, reiterated the same sentiment when he said:
                    "We have overpowered our enemies [and agreed] that we can afford to be generous.
                    … All this is brought to an end at once and forever by this dreadful event."</p>

                    </placeName>, the Reverend Daniel Stewart told a church full of Presbyterians, "The feeling
                    of compassion for a conquered enemy should pass over into the feeling of revenge for an irreparable
                    act." In <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
               </placeName>-educated Unitarian James Freeman Clarke, a liberal
                    protestant from Protestantism who dared decorate his church with all the splendor of a Catholic
                    cathedral, bluntly warned his congregation that rebel politicians were usurping the government. His
                    funeral voice thundered from the myterious shadows under purple drapes looped to the walls with
                    white flowers, "In dying [Lincoln] may have saved us from their audacious craft."</p>
            <p>The justice of enfranchising the ex-slaves was voiced by many ministers, unconscious, perhaps, of all
                    its aspects. The Reverend Richard Eddy disguised the political motive only slightly when he told his
                    congregation that justice called not for vengeance but for the full penalty of the law for treason,
                    utter extinction of rebellion and "the equality of all men [to vote?] before the
                    law." The political benefit of <pb n="36" id="VAA4025-041-1-040"/> keeping Southern
                    Democrats disfranchised was noted specifically by the Reverend W. H. Hornblower, Presbyterian

                    to vote, but the objection came poorly from those "who rush to thrust a ballot into the
                    hand of every [Democratic?] foreigner." Presbyterians in <placeName>

                    heard their pastor, the Reverend I. N. Sprague, admit frankly that the Negro vote "will be
                    needed, to counteract the foreign and Popish influence that is gaining such a strong
                    foothold." For originality of expression the laurels belong to a fundamentalist preacher in <placeName>

                    his congregation of Methodist Episcopalians: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Men have willingly assumed the doctrine that the African race is not human … that
                            the African was but a superior type of Orang Outang. The same class of reasoning was adopted
                            years ago to prove that the Dutch originally were fish, which being left high and dry by the
                            tide, gradually accommodated themselves to the change of circumstances. The tails being no
                            longer useful gradually wore away. … The popular objections to the peculiar
                            physical structure of the African are simply absurd. … The fact is unquestioned
                            that if the negro be condemned on craniological principles, we must concede the highest type
                            of female beauty, the statue of Venus, to represent the head of an idiot. It is claimed that
                            the African has always been in subjection, when the truth is, that the negroes have never
                            been conquered by the whites.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>Quite naturally radical politicians took advantage of every evidence of popular approval of Negro
                    equality which strengthened the structure of their party. The line between Christian ethics and
                    party politics is hard to draw in this instance. Vindictive reconstruction with Negro suffrage would
                    save the party and at the same time soothe the most exacting conscience. The by-elections were a
                    year and a half away. During that time party leaders might profit by watching or aggravating the

                    Lincoln's corpse bore traces of the horror of assassination. Undertakers were denied the
                    privilege of treating the dead man's skin to make it look as though he were asleep.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> The people must see Lincoln in death—murdered by the Confederacy. A
                    million people did see him in all his ghastliness and seven millions more, it was reported, watched
                    at rural stations as the funeral train swept by. But, in spite of the studied drama, the passage of
                    time healed the people's passions. The vindictiveness of the sermons preached after the
                    first outburst on April 16 became less pronounced. On the first Sunday after the assassination 78
                    per cent of the sermons published recommended, as did the Reverend John Chester in <placeName>

                    unprincipled, unrepentant leaders and instigators of this rebellion." Ministers quoted at
                    length from the Bible to show that people must suffer for their sins. The Reverend David Swing, who
                    claimed to know God's will and certainly understood the people's, told his
                    congregation at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, "God is not willing that the voice of mercy
                    shall be heard." This vindictiveness had begun to subside by prayer meeting night, April
                    19. The sermons, also published and preserved, of this later day disclose that only 72 per cent of
                    the ministers retained their original rancor toward the South. The heat of rage was consuming
                    itself. By June 1, the day set aside for humiliation and prayer by Lincoln's successor,
                    Andrew Johnson, only 63 per cent of the sermons cried for vengeance. This was the last date on which
                    funeral addresses were published in quantity, so this analysis cannot be carried further, but
                    obviously the people's anger at the South was diminishing. Radical politicians would have
                    to resort to some other stimulant to hold the advantage they had gained by the death of Lincoln.

            <p>Culpability of the South for the deaths of other presidents before Lincoln was also pronounced from

                    and Taylor and attempted by similar means to kill Buchanan. The South, he shouted angrily, starved
                    Northern prisoners of war, and when this failed to make their deaths sufficiently loathsome, yellow
                    fever was imported from the West Indies to finish the survivors. In North Cole-brook, <placeName>

                    "We think we can see that the probable course of President Lincoln in the sequel of the
                    rebellion would not have commended itself to the … majority of his
                    constituents," he told the Universalist congregation. "Is it not for him well,
                    that he has been taken away while his garland was fresh and green?… Now, his reputation
                    is secure." Rationalizing this thought on a higher plane, the Reverend William A. Snively
                    told his followers, "It may be that the Infinite Wisdom saw that there was too much
                    kindness in that great heart to meet the stern issues of penalty which justice demands."
                    God removed Lincoln, the Reverend Mr. Snively concluded, to give place to one better

            <p>Vice-President Johnson's fitness to carry on received diverse appraisals. Radical preachers
                    were reassured by Johnson's record. He had dared call secessionists
                    "traitors" to their faces. On the other hand, Johnson had been reported on
                    inauguration day to be under the influence of alcohol. He had been noisy on the platform, spoke
                    incoherently, it was said. Preachers were baffled in their efforts to appraise such a man. The

                    pointed out, was not elected President. "But while Abraham Lincoln was the choice of the

                    </placeName> in 1791. From his thirteenth year, when he ran away from his family, his life was
                    punctuated by a series of violent and sanguinary criminal adventures. He robbed, maimed, and
                    murdered as much for the pleasure of misusing his victims as for profit. His satisfaction in every
                    sort of excess and deceit soon brought him to the attention of the police of half a dozen countries.</p>
            <p>Dahmen's personality was as disarming as his enmity was deadly. He was a small man, well
                    built, and very handsome. His charm and incalculable nerve admitted him to a military academy in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Metz</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he learned to dance and fence and to affect the manners of a gentleman and
                    officer. He became an intimate of Prince Murat, whom he served. Such elegant surroundings taught him
                    new and more refined vices; the duelling sword, for which he had a genius, provided him with
                    adventure as well as a living. Gambling and forgery took the place of his youthful barbarities.
                    After surviving the horrors of Napoleon's Russian campaign, he returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>

                    Louis XVIII, and so was discharged. The following year he joined Blucher and participated in
                    Bonaparte's defeat at Waterloo.</p>
            <p>To escape arrest for a substantial forgery which he had committed in Murat's service, Dahmen

                    Before this matter could be cleared up he became the principal of one of the most notorious murder
                    trials of the early Midwest.</p>
            <p>Reuben Kidder's account of these exploits, <hi rend="i">The Life and Adventures of John

                    discriminating <pb n="46" id="VAA4025-041-1-050"/> dealer in rare books, who waited until it had
                    been purchased to write: "When I dipped into it, I went off the deep end. I think it is the
                    most outstanding Mid-western item of its type and is destined to remain so."</p>
            <p>Each generation produces its own classic murder trial. Although Indiana in the early days had the
                    reputation for some very romantic desperadoes, the trial of John Dahmen was attended with great
                    interest and enthusiasm. It was the event of the year. In colorfulness, bravado, imagination and in
                    the principal element of the picaresque, the personality of the defendant, it lacked none of the
                    ingredients for a large and fascinated audience.</p>

                    murdered body was discovered, and Dahmen, who lived about twenty miles from the city, was charged
                    with the crime. Dahmen confessed readily and volunteered to relate with utter dispassion the details
                    of an additional murder, that of John Jenzer whom he had dispatched a few days after disposing of
                    Nolte. He was immediately placed in irons and jailed with two horse thieves. In spite of the
                    precautions, all three managed to break out, and Dahmen, after he had killed one of the thieves
                    named Linthecomb, fled to <placeName>

                    in Dahmen's defense. He had already tried his hand at authorship, for in 1819 Edmund Dana

                    considerable ability. Much of his material was gathered from Dahmen in the process of building his
                    defense. Later, when the case had been lost, Kidder reported that Dahmen, who was chained to the
                    jail floor, was very glad for his company and more than willing to pass the time recounting his
                    earlier exploits.</p>
            <p>Considering the immense popularity of the trial, it is almost certain that Kidder's book was
                    issued in a relatively large edition. Inspite of such a probability, no copies are recorded in

                    records that, through the agency of friends, Dahmen inserted a "certificate" in

                    attests the authority and reliability of Kidder's biography. Woodruff's letter,
                    which is dated July 4, states: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Since a certificate signed by Dahmen has been published,<hi rend="sup">7</hi> stating that

                            heard him in prison relate the story and adventures of his whole life not ten days before

                </p>
            <p>This certainly indicates that Kidder had issued an earlier pamphlet or book—while Dahmen
                    was still alive. The revision in the form of the copies which have survived was apparently made
                    after Dahmen's execution in order to provide additional copies for the market and to
                    include Woodruff's rebuttal to Dahmen's attack on its first appearance.</p>
            <p>What is most unclear about Woodruff's letter is that he wrote on July 4, two days before
                    Dahmen was hanged, as though the execution were a <hi rend="i">fait accompli.</hi> That Dahmen was
                    not executed until July 6, is established elsewhere in the book and is substantiated by the records

            <p>Five years ago the Congregation of Holy Cross which conducts the University of Notre Dame built a
                    modern printing plant and installed the most modern printing presses in it. This rejuvenation marked
                    the seventy-fifth anniversary of a printing plant which had been started in 1865 by Father Edward
                    Sorin, the founder of Notre Dame. It shows too that the increasing number of publications of the
                    University kept pace with the rapid growth of the University between the two world wars and made
                    necessary a new and modernized press.</p>
            <p>But the printing press bought in 1865 was not the first press at Notre Dame. As early as 1845 when
                    the University of Notre Dame was only a year and a few months old, Father Sorin, whose energy and
                    healthy ambition was only partially restrained by poverty, purchased a press secondhand in nearby <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Niles</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>. It became the first university press in Indiana and apparently the first university
                    press in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The term university press is not easy to define, particularly for the nineteenth century. Even the
                    term university was frequently used with a different connotation than today. Notre Dame received a
                    charter from the State of Indiana in January, 1844, to grant university degrees. Legally then it was
                    a university. In fact it was far from what would today be called a university. For in 1844 it was,
                    like many another university of the time, a grammar school and high school with a few students
                    studying Latin and Greek and working for an A.B. degree. A similar elasticity of meaning may be
                    found in the term university press. Today we associate the term with an institution which prints and
                    publishes works or journals of a serious academic character.</p>
            <p>The whole subject of university presses in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> has been very ably studied by Dr. John Lane in a doctoral dissertation of the

                    labor,—and one can readily sympathize with this objective when one has seen his
                    work,—he excludes from consideration in his classification those universities whose
                    publications did not bear the imprint: University Press, or some similar expression. Thus a
                    university press which may have been in existence for many years only becomes a university press
                    when one of its publications bears the imprint: University Press.</p>
            <p>While readily understanding the motives which lead to this decision, the decision still remains
                    somewhat arbitrary. According to it the first university press was that of Cornell which lasted from
                    1869 to 1884.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> In the same year, 1869, the University Press Company was started
                    at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. The third university press is then listed as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>1883. The University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana had operated its second printing
                            plant since 1865. The publications of 1883, and possibly some earlier ones, were produced by
                            this plant with the "university press" imprint. It is not certain that the
                            University failed in any subsequent period to employ versions of the imprint in some of its
                            publications. Thus the University of Notre Dame appears to be the oldest continuous user of
                            the imprint: "University Press."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote>Here it is clearly seen that the Notre Dame press is classified in third place on a
                    technicality—the use of two words at the bottom of the title page. It would seem more
                    logical to classify this University of Notre Dame press first since it was founded in 1865 and the
                    direction and organization of its work was similar in 1883 to what it was in 1865.</p>
            <p>In his classification of university presses, Dr. Lane omits entirely the first Notre Dame press of
                    1845-1847, although he does include material on it in the appendix. In this article we wish to
                    describe this first press and give additional material which has come to light since Dr. Lane wrote
                    his thesis.</p>

                    of their arrival and the spring of 1844, Father Sorin and his Brothers had built another log cabin
                    to serve as a chapel and a novitiate, a square two story brick building and the first college
                    building. Everything was relatively small for poverty and enrollment were all-powerful determinants
                    in planning the college. The studies of those days were elementary. In a few cases, they were of
                    college caliber if the students were old enough and had what was considered sufficient background.
                    From these few suggestions of what frontier education was in the 1840's, it is natural to
                    wonder why Father Sorin needed a printing press. And yet the reasons were rather obvious. To found a
                    college with very little money is no easy feat. Father Sorin, a born optimist, thought that by
                    printing books and selling them throughout the region that he could not only give a new impetus to
                    his missionary and educational effort but increase his income as well. Besides, it would be cheaper
                    he thought to print the textbooks needed for the young university than to buy them. Again he wanted
                    the press to print in English the <hi rend="i">Rules and Constitutions</hi> of the religious
                    organization for his Brothers, and the Sisters who had joined him since his arrival. Finally it
                    would be helpful for doing the odd job printing for the university and the community.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The press seems to have been bought in the spring of 1845 for Father Sorin wrote to the Superior of
                    St-Mary-of-the-Woods on April 30 of that year offering to print the Sisters' Constitutions
                    when the press was delivered.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> It was only in October of the same year, however,

            <p>The Committee on Bibliography is taking pardonable pride in the recent announcement that its first
                    book, <hi rend="i">A Bibliography of James Whitcomb Riley</hi>, by the late Anthony J. Russo and
                    Dorothy R. Russo, was selected by the American Institute of Graphic Arts as one of the
                    "Fifty Best Books of 1944." Judgment is rendered on the basis of typography,
                    presswork, paper, and binding. The honor, of course, goes to the printer, The Lakeside Press, but
                    the decision of the Committee on Bibliography to use that press and to spend the money necessary to
                    obtain a superior piece of bookmaking is now richly rewarded. Both the book and its publisher, the
                    Historical Society, will receive national attention, as the Fifty Best Books are sent on an
                    exhibition tour to libraries around the country.</p>
            <p>The Historical Society has been interested in three measures before the state legislature. House Bill
                    No. 88, authorizing the Department of Conservation to assume control of and to restore the
                    Whitewater Canal System as a public memorial, was passed by the legislature and signed by the
                    governor. Two other bills were related to the commemoration of the assertion of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> authority in 1796 over the northwestern posts and that part of the Old Northwest
                    previously held by Great Britain. That event is to be marked by <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, and
                    Indiana in 1946, the 150th anniversary. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> has made extensive plans, particularly for marking and beautifying the highways that
                    follow closely upon the routes of Generals Harmar, St. Clair, and Wayne in their campaigns against
                    the Indians and British from 1790 to 1795. House Bill No. 340 authorizes the creation of an Anthony
                    Wayne Trails Commission to determine the routes followed by those winners of the West, after which
                    those routes would become part of the state highway system to be appropriately marked and
                    maintained. This bill has passed the House and the Senate, and has been signed by the governor.
                    Senate Bill No. 219 which would have established an Anthony Wayne Memorial Commission to prepare
                    plans for the erection of a state and national shrine on the site of old <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> as part of the anniversary <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-041-1-062"/> observance, passed the
                    Senate but died in a committee of the House.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, deserves the commendation of the Historical Society. Since January he has persuaded
                    thirty-nine persons of the advantages of belonging to the society, collected their membership dues,
                    and delivered same to the secretary's office. We are happy to welcome the new members. And
                    Mr. Lockridge is still in action.</p>
            <p>Eli Lilly, president of the Indiana Historical Society, gave a luncheon in Mr. Peckham's
                    honor at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on February 8. About fifty society officers, faculty members of the universities, and
                    other persons interested in state historical work, including Governor Ralph F. Gates, were invited.
                    The Governor tendered an official welcome, and several other guests were asked to speak.</p>

                    boarded the British ship, Queen Charlotte, with the other prisoners bound for Quebec by way of
                    Niagara and Montreal. After one night on the ship, the other women were moved to another vessel and

                                    night—We are now ready to start, I wish you could see us, it is really
                                    laughable to witness the comical scenes that are acted— I have a large
                                    bag on the Pomell of My saddle containing some necessary articles, a Bible, Homers
                                    Illiad, &amp; A huge Spunge cake presented by one of our kind Friends the
                                    morning of our departure. I enjoy myself very much, &amp; one great source of
                                    pleasure is, anticipating yours if I should ever be permitted to relate in person
                                    the many curious circumstances that occur.</p>
                        <p>18. A M.</p>
                        <p>The General is beating, I must put away my pen &amp; turn out to have my House
                                    packed for marching. We have stoped for the night, it has rain'd all day, I
                                    got wet through, we stoped in the woods &amp; had a large fire made, no scarcity
                                    of wood here, have brilliant fires, the Waiters gather heaps of dry sticks &amp;
                                    place them against a large green tree, the branches of which served for a shelter
                                    while we dried ourselves, rather uncomfortable drying wet garments in this
                                    maner—After this used an umbralla &amp; went on nicly, the fatigue of
                                    the day has given me a fine appetite, our supper is ready, &amp; Josiah is
                                    beging me to eat good [to] night, we rode through some beautiful forests, ground
                                    enamelled with flowers.</p>
                        <p>19th bright Sun, all going on in good health &amp; spirits, but my feelings are
                                    somewhat tried seeing the poor Soldiers wives trudging on foot, some of the way mud
                                    up to their knees, &amp; a little Child in their arms, only 4 or 5 Waggons
                                    allowed to carry the baggage, the poor women of course have to suffer, I should
                                    think it would kill them, saw two Houses one of them deserted, afraid of the
                                    Indians. We understand a camp of them are near <hi rend="i">us</hi>, hunting, they
                                    subsist in this way. I suppose you will be anxious to know what we have to eat, how
                                    we carry conveniences to eat out of, &amp; how we cook —we live very
                                    well as to the quality of our victuals &amp; have enough, plenty of elegant <hi rend="i">Bacon (nothing better)</hi> in this part of the world they smoke the
                                    whole Hog, you would laugh to see our waiters roast chickens, they take a green
                                    stick &amp; put the fowel on it &amp; put the <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-041-1-066"/> stick in the ground before a good fire, &amp; they
                                    roast to a charm, &amp; when they roast a joint of meat, two sticks are put in
                                    the ground, opposite the fire cut like a fork at the top, &amp; another put
                                    across resting on the two with the meat suspended from the center, meat cooked in
                                    this way is very good endeed, we have a pack horse who carries a pair of mess Boxes
                                    made with separate apartments to hold cups plates &amp; cccc &amp; our tea
                                    &amp; sugar in canisters, &amp; our table is the hind board of a waggon set
                                    on a portable cricket made like a cot bedstead, our candlestick is a bayonet
                                    reversed with the point in the ground, the part which goes on to the gun, serves
                                    admirably for a socket to put the candle in. tonight we have encamped near a House,
                                    the Land Lady is very Patriotic &amp; very large, weighs 300, she gave all the
                                    Soldiers plenty of Milk.</p>

                                    breathed his last in a waggon, he is buried in the woods, in a bark Coffen, the only
                                    one, the times would admit of.</p>
                        <p>23d Every step fetches us nearer home, yet it is a roundabout way to get there, I
                                    think could I see you once more I could sit &amp; look at you for A month at

                                    put some between the ground &amp; buffaloe robe, which serves for our bed,
                                    &amp; when straw is scarce, we substitute the leaves of trees, &amp; cover
                                    them with bark which makes an excellent carpet for our tent, &amp; renders it
                                    very comfortable, with a fire at the door, to keep the Musquitoes from devouring us,

                                    very clever, has been on a campaign ere this, steps to the sound of a Drum, equal to
                                    any regular &amp; minds the fireing of guns, no more than you would the singing
                                    of Birds, I sit on her while the Men discharge their guns.</p>

                                    feel as if you would not object to hear me, I assured him, it would give me pleasure
                                    to alleviate his sufferings all in my power, he then informed me what his desease
                                    was, said it was hereditary that his Mother &amp; several of his family had died
                                    with the same, Spoke with the greatest calmness of his immediate dissolution which
                                    he thought must take place ere tomorrows sun sunk in the West, as there was an
                                    abscess forming which on breaking would in all probability terminate his existance,
                                    he appeared to feel <hi rend="i">perfectly confident</hi> of his <hi rend="i">acceptance</hi> with <hi rend="i">God</hi> on the <hi rend="i">score</hi> of
                                        <hi rend="i">his own merits</hi>, he <hi rend="i">acknowledged</hi> no <hi rend="i">Savior</hi>, he <hi rend="i">needed none</hi> his own righteousness was
                                    all sufficient, I <hi rend="i">knew</hi>, I <hi rend="i">felt</hi>, he was <hi rend="i">altogether wrong</hi>, that he was <hi rend="i">building</hi> on the
                                        <hi rend="i">Sand</hi>, but I was so struck with finding him so near his end,
                                    &amp; with the calmness &amp; resignation he discovered, &amp; feeling
                                    my incompetency <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-041-1-074"/> to direct him aright, that it
                                    took from me almost the power of utterance, &amp; I left him without Saying one
                                        <hi rend="i">word</hi> to undeceive him. O how <hi rend="i">culpable</hi> was
                                        <hi rend="i">I</hi> thus to see the fellow creature just on the verge of
                                    eternity &amp; not say one word to endeavour, to convince him, of the sandy
                                    foundation, on which he was building, My feelings on leaving him were indiscribable,
                                    for I could not indulge the hope that he would survive, after hearing his
                                    explanation &amp; the certainty he felt that he must die, &amp; he was
                                    correct, for the next day as the Sun gain'd its Meridian he yielded his
                                    spirit to him who gave it. he observed to me while conversing, that he felt very
                                    grateful to God, that he had no Mother, to mourn his loss,—he was buried
                                    the next day with Military honors, he was much esteemed &amp; respected.</p>
                        <p>I was much mortified while a prisoner, to hear a British Officer say, the <placeName>

                                    you have federal governers, nothing would delight them so much as a disunion,
                                    &amp; they are strengthened in the Idea by reading so many improper pieces in
                                    the paper, but I know the vile productions which I see in the papers are not the
                                    sentiments of a majority of the people in the place which ranked among the first to
                                    achieve our independence. O may the bright flame of patriotism, which glowed in the

                        <p>15 August</p>
                        <p>A summons has been sent to day, from General B. [Isaac Brock] Commander of the

                                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                                    </placeName>, to General H. [Hull], to surrender <placeName>

                                    </placeName> with the Army to him, this the general has not seen fit to comply with,
                                    &amp; every preperation is making for a Bombardment, the British Soldiers are
                                    very busy puling down the, large House which conceals their Battery, if I did not
                                    feel halfe frightened out of my wits, I could laugh, to see what quick work, they
                                    make of it, never did a building come down quicker, all the Women &amp; Children
                                    are to go into the Fort as the only secure place against the Indians, &amp; the

                                    summons have returned &amp; as soon as they arrive on the Opposite shore the
                                    fireing will commence.</p>
                        <p>19 August</p>
                        <p>Amidst the horrors of War I have not been able to compose myself sufficiently to
                                    write a line, but as the carnage has ceased with us for the present, &amp; I
                                    with my Dear Husband &amp; many others, are prisoners of war, seated very
                                    quietly in his Majestys Ship the <hi rend="i">Queen Charlotte</hi>, I will now
                                    endeavour to give an account of some of the very interesting events which have
                                    transpired within these five days past. While the bearers of the summons were
                                    returning with a negative to their demand, I took Mrs Hs oldest girl, a Child about
                                    three years old &amp; went into the Fort which was some distance from our House,
                                    &amp; I did not tarry by the way I assure you, but when I arrived I found many
                                    had got there before me. it was not long, <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-041-1-075"/> before
                                    the fireing of cannon commenced on both sids, &amp; continued without effecting
                                    anything, till the enemy about midnight discontinued, &amp; we ceased allso,
                                    some of us females &amp; Children had not been able to eat anything all day,
                                    &amp; feeling very faint concluded to make some tea, this meal we might call an
                                    early breakfast as it was one in the Morning when we partooke of it, after this we
                                    endeavoured to get some sleep. Captin Sn. had been married only 'two days previous
                                    to this dismal event, &amp; his Bride a <hi rend="i">sweet little Girl of 14
                                        years</hi> of age, was with us. She with her nephew a Child of 5 or 6 years old,
                                        <hi rend="i">cried themselves</hi> to sleep, as <hi rend="i">children</hi> often
                                    do. In vain I tried to court the drowsey God, Sleep was banished from my eyes,
                                    &amp; many others found it as difficult as myself to get a moments
                                    rest—it was a night long to be remembered &amp; a scene never to be
                                    forgotten,</p>
                        <p>16 August Soon as auroras beautiful rays adorned the east, the Cannon began to roar
                                    apparently with tenfold fury, to do execution, the enemys shot began to enter the
                                    Fort, &amp; as some Ladies were making cylinders, (bags to hold the powder)
                                    &amp; scraping lint in case it should be wanted, a 24 pound shot entered the
                                    next door to the one they were in, &amp; cut two Officers who were standing in
                                    the entry directly in two their bowels gushing out, the same ball passed through the
                                    Wall into a room where a number of people were &amp; took the legs of one man
                                    off &amp; the flesh of the thigh of another the person who had his legs shot off
                                    died in a short time, thus <hi rend="i">one</hi> of these angry Messengers destroyed
                                    the lives of three &amp; wounded a fourth in a moment of time, one of the
                                    Gentlemen who was killed in the entry, was a Capt in the regular Army, &amp; had
                                    been taken prisoner at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, and was in the Fort for safty, as he was not allowed, to take up Arms
                                    till he was exchanged, soon after this, another ball of equal size, entered the
                                    Hospital room, &amp; a poor fellow who lay sick on his bed, had his head
                                    severed, from his body instantly, &amp; his attendant was likewise killed, the
                                    shot striking him in his breast, the enemy had got the range of the Fort so
                                    completely, that it was considered dangerous for the Woman &amp; Children to
                                    stay any longer in the Quarters, &amp; we all hurried to a root House (on the
                                    opposite side of the Fort) which was bomb proofe. never shall I forget my sensation
                                    as I crossed the Parade ground to gain the place of safty, you must recollect, my
                                    feelings had been under constant excitement for many weeks, &amp; now were
                                    wrought up to a high pitch, <hi rend="i">weep</hi> I <hi rend="i">could not,
                                        complain I would not</hi>, &amp; I felt as if my nerves would burst, my hair
                                    felt as if it was erect upon my head, which was not covered, &amp; my eyes
                                    raised upward to catch a glimpse of the bombs shells &amp; balls that were
                                    flying in all directions, in the midst of all this, I saw the little Boy whose
                                    Father was tomahawked by Indians at <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                                    </placeName>, runing about on the parapets exposed to the fire of the enemey as
                                    fearlessly as if in play—on gaining the root House, I found it nearly
                                    full of Woman &amp; Children, one Lady so sick obliged to be carried there in a
                                    bed. What a scene was here presented, such lamentation, &amp; weeping, I never
                                    heard before, &amp; I sincerely hope I never shall again, among all this number
                                    but three appeared composed, &amp; they felt more than can be described, the
                                    Wife of one of the Officers who had been shot as above mentioned, was in an agony of
                                    grief as you may <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-041-1-076"/> well suppose, &amp; amidst
                                    her lamentation, asking what she <hi rend="i">had done</hi> to deserve this sore
                                    trouble. O thought, I, what have any of us <hi rend="i">done</hi> to <hi rend="i">diserve any thing else</hi>, one Child too young to realize danger, was
                                    screaming most violently for its attendent to walk with her on the Parapet, on
                                    looking out of the door of the root House, opposite, I saw a Ball take a chiminy
                                    down &amp; was told the same ball killed some one on the Parapet, the other side
                                    of the House, who was stationed there on duty—</p>
                        <p>About this time, the Enemy landed on our side, under cover of their armed Vessels, of
                                    which they had a sufficiency to demolish <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                                    </placeName> if they chose, &amp; we had not a boat in order to carry a single
                                    gun. &amp; General Brock's effective force was double, the number of
                                    ours— The Indians were let lose upon the inhabitants in all directions,
                                    &amp; but a very small supply of Provision &amp; Ammunition, under such
                                    circumstances the General after counciling Col Miller saw fit to<hi rend="sup">2</hi> surrender under the best terms he could, for in addition to what I have
                                    already stated a part of the Generals more efficient force, were some distance from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                                    </placeName> where they had been sent on duty previous to the summons. A white flag
                                    was accordingly displayed upon the Parapet the common signal for a cessation of
                                    hostilities, &amp; the Cannon ceased to roar, all was still. Immediatly the
                                    Enemy sent to ascertain, for what purpose the white flag was exhibited, &amp;
                                    learnt the determination of the General to surrender.</p>
                        <p>Our Soldiers were then marched on to the Parade ground in the Frot, w[h]ere they
                                    stacked their arms, which were then deliver'd to the Enemy, the American
                                    colors were taken from the Stafe on the Fort &amp; immediatly replaced by the
                                    English colors, &amp; a <hi rend="i">royal salute</hi> fired, from the very
                                    cannon, taken from them in the revolutionary war — while their music
                                    played God save the King, their <hi rend="i">national tune</hi>, in the most livily
                                    maner. A thousand emotions struggled in my breast, <hi rend="i">too numerous for
                                        utterance, &amp; too exquisitly painful to be described</hi>, —

                                    were put in to another Vessel, ours being very crowded, &amp; I was left
                                    intirely without a female to communicate a thought to, but I think notwithstanding
                                    our being prisoners, you would have laughed heartily, could you have seen us, when
                                    we laid ourselves down for the night. I am sure <hi rend="i">I</hi> never felt in a

                                    who was not in our Cabin, there was but one stateroom in the Cabin allotted for the
                                    Prisoners, &amp; this had been taken possession of by Mrs F ere Mrs S and I
                                    arrived, Capt S, was much offended that a stateroom had not been provided for his
                                    beautiful Bride, <hi rend="i">who had been so hardly a week.</hi> To be sure we was
                                    led to expect more from British Officers whose politeness to the Ladies is
                                    proverbial, than their monopolizing all the Staterooms for their own use, but as we
                                    had been accustomed for many months to make the best of every thing, we thought it
                                    the best Policy to do so on the present occasion, &amp; therefore proceded to
                                    arrange our beds as well as we could, consulting comfort &amp; decency, as much
                                    as the times would possibly admit. Capt S, put his bed next the State room where
                                    Capt F &amp; his wife were, we put ours next his, he took his place next the
                                    door his wife next him, I laid down by her &amp; my husband the other side of
                                    me. thus he &amp; Capt S formed a guard for their wives, while the rest, all
                                    gentlemen, covered the rest of the floor completely, altho nothing but variety had
                                    been our portion for many a month, I must confess the unpresedented novelety of our
                                    present situation intirely excluded sleep from our eyes, tho every thing in the Ship
                                    was quiet but ourselves, one Officer passing through our Cabin observed we were a
                                    merry set of prisoners, Mrs S requested him to give her some water to drink, which
                                    he politely complied with We were wind bound several days, which was very tedious
                                    being crowded &amp; our fare not very good, one day at table a gentleman
                                    observed to me if I could eat such bread as this, (breaking as he spoke, a biscuit
                                    which he held in his hand), I was a better Soldier than he, for as he broke the
                                    bread, the <hi rend="i">hairs &amp; Sticks</hi> shewed to great advantage, I was
                                    the <hi rend="i">best Soldier</hi> if eating the bread without thinking of the <hi rend="i">dirt</hi> made <hi rend="i">one</hi>, for untile my attention was

                                    relish, one day I made a <hi rend="i">huge apple pudding</hi>, which the Gentlemen
                                    enjoyed very much endeed, sewing, reading, &amp; conversation, made the time
                                    pass talerably pleasant. When we went on board the Charlotte I had A bundle in my
                                    hand containing some work, with all my sewing apparratus a very handsome pearl
                                    breast Pin (the Gift of Brother John Bacon) &amp; some money, this bundle as I
                                    was assending the side of the Vessel from a boat which conveyed us to it I put into
                                    the <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-041-1-078"/> hand of one of the men who rowed the boat,
                                    &amp; never saw the man or bundle again, this was a serious evil I thought at
                                    the time as I should be deprived the pleasure of sewing, my favorite employment, but
                                    a young Officer (Brittish) learning my misfortune went ashore &amp; purchased,
                                    needles, pins, scisors, &amp; thread &amp; presented them to
                                    me—we were 14 days before we reached Buffaloe, 11 of which we lay waiting
                                    for a fair wind, &amp; only 3 days going across Lake Eri, it was a pleasant
                                    sail, when we landed at Eri on the Cannada side, the Commanding Officer gave General
                                    Hull the liberty to fill the Carraige which was provided for him &amp; his Aid
                                    &amp; the only one which could be procured at the place. My Husband had been
                                    long acquainted with the General, which I suppose was the reason of his offering us
                                    the vacant seats in preferance to others, &amp; as my Husbands duties ceased
                                    when the Soldiers were prisoners, he could avail himselfe of this comfortable
                                    conveyance. Officers of the line were obliged to be with their
                                    Men—&amp; I after wards understood their wives had a very
                                    uncomfortable time in geting to <placeName>

                                    &amp; now behold us seated with the General &amp; his Aid guarded by
                                    Officers of suitable rank on horse back, 2 each side the Carraige, &amp; 2
                                    behind &amp; the same number preceeding us, going just as fast as they could

                                    as they were I am inclined to think it was at the risk of our necks, we were hurried
                                    along with such velocity, the reason for their so doing I presume was, they feared
                                    our getin a view of their fortifications, which were erected at short distances from
                                    Eri to New Ark—In descending Queenstown Heights, I expected we should be
                                    precipitated into the abyss below, my head whirl'd as I endeavoured to
                                    catch a view as we flew along, We dined at a Tavern near the Falls of Niagra, These
                                    Falls, of which I had heard so much, I had a great desire to see, &amp; oft
                                    times had said when speaking of returning home, we must see Niagra Falls before we
                                    return, &amp; now I could be gratifyed, but how strangly brought about, I
                                    observed to the Officer in command that altho a prisoner I hoped to be permitted to
                                    view the Falls, he immediatly answered in the affirmative, immediatly after dinner

                                    we had time to examine them, but this was not as long as we could have wished as we
                                    must reach our destined Haven that afternoon, but since then, under more <hi rend="i">propitious circumstances</hi>, we have been astonished and delighted

                                    the habitation through the trees which was to be our resting place for the night, we
                                    were received with hospitality by the Docters family, who expressed much interest
                                    for us, &amp; endeavoured in every possible way to make us comfortable,

                                    been shewn us by them, that the knowledge of anyones being a Stranger seems to be a

                                    we proceeded on our journey towards the place of our nativity, the Stage at this
                                    time did not run farther than Buffaloe, 36 miles from where we then were, &amp;
                                    we hired a Cart the best vehicle the times would afford in this Cart, we put our
                                    trunks, &amp; on a trunk we put our Mattrass &amp; thus made a tolerable
                                    comfortable seat, but the roads were dreadful, logs most of the way slightly covered
                                    with earth, we bore the jolting till our limbs seemed almost dislocated &amp;
                                    then, tried how walking would affect us, this was some reliefe, but fearing to
                                    blister my feet which were hardly well, we had recourse to our miserable conveyance
                                    again, &amp; about 9 at night arrived at a wretched tavern the only one we could

                                    travel'd was only 18 miles The badness of the roads, &amp; the frequent
                                    interruptions occasioned by the Officers Stationed all along the road, calling on
                                    Josiah to give them an account of the Surrender, of which they had as yet heard only
                                    imperfectly related, detained us very much, &amp; wearied exceedingly with our
                                    days travel we gladly avail'd ourselves of a shelter for the night however
                                    mean, on entering the House I was immediatly struck with the Paucity of everything
                                    that could be called comfortable, &amp; feared we had not exchanged our
                                    situation for the better, the event proved we had not, the only female we saw
                                    prepared us a miserable supper, which after we had tried to eat, I sat till I
                                    thought I should have fallen on to the floor, so fearful was I of seeing the room
                                    where we were to sleep, while waiting for our repast we heard a <hi rend="i">groan</hi>, &amp; on enquiring if anyone was sick, in the House, was answered
                                    in the affirmative, on asking who it was, they said it was a young Soldier sick with
                                    the camp fever—at last I told Josiah I must go to bed, &amp; we were
                                    shown up a <hi rend="i">ladder</hi> into an appartment where the poor young man,
                                    whom I should not think more than 18 years old lay very ill endeed, so ill they
                                    thought he must die, he looked dreadfully, the head of his bed was close to the door
                                    of the room we were to occupy, which was off its <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-041-1-081"/>

                                    consisting of Six panes of glass mostly broken, admitted the full moon which shone
                                    with uncommon brilliancy, &amp; helped to make more visible the <hi rend="i">extreme filth</hi> of the place, one traveler seemingly unconscious of the <hi rend="i">weal</hi> or <hi rend="i">Woe</hi> that surrounded him was in one of
                                    the beds, the other was for us, the pillow cases was the color of coal &amp; on
                                    turning down the cloths they were worse <hi rend="i">if possible, &amp; emitted
                                        such an efluvia</hi> that with difficulty I was kept from being sick. O said I,
                                    soon as I recovered power to articulate, dont let us stay here, do go into the barn,
                                    or <hi rend="i">outdoor</hi>, or <hi rend="i">anywhere</hi> rather than pass the
                                    night in such a place as this, it appeared to me it was more dreadful than any place
                                    I had been in through the whole Campaign, (one reason I presume for this <hi rend="i">was</hi>, my having been so much in the open air) that dirt &amp;
                                    confinement appeard terrific)—but Josiah with his prevailing desire to
                                    make the best of every thing observed, dont say a word, they have given us the best
                                    they could, I told him if we must stay, we would not undress, but spread our pocket
                                    handkerchief on the Pillows, &amp; lay down on the out side of the bed, this he
                                    agreed too, which we accordingly did, but sleep had fled, &amp; the bugs which
                                    begun their repast soon as we got warm &amp; from the voraciousness with which
                                    they regaled upon our poor wearied bodies, evinced they had not made a meal for a
                                    long time, combined with the piercing groans of the dying man &amp; the stench
                                    which came from his bed, precluded even the possibility of such a thing—
                                    besids the thundering of the mighty Cataract would have been sufficient to have
                                    banished sleep, with this combination of circumstances you can form some <hi rend="i">faint Idea</hi> of what a dreadful night we passed, &amp; it can be
                                    but faint either, for I have not the command of language sufficient to give you any
                                    adequate conception of the scenee. As soon as the day dawned we arose, &amp;
                                    looking at the young Man as we passed, we saw he was near his end, A person
                                    apparently his own age attended him, perhap he was his Brother, but I asked no
                                    questions &amp; hasted away fearing we had imbibed the disease. In reviewing
                                    this scene I have often thought how supremely selfish I was, instead of passing the
                                    night, in useless regrets, that we were so situated, it was my duty to have
                                    endeavoured to alleviate the sufferings of the sick stranger, possibly I might have
                                    rendered him some service that would have been beneficial, at any rate my own
                                    reflections would not have been so painful at the retrospect. While the man who
                                    drove us was attending to his horse &amp; preparing to depart, we visited the
                                    Falls for a few momments, &amp; bid them Adieu as we thought forever, &amp;
                                    once more taking possession of our splendid Vehicle, we proceeded on our journey
                                    &amp; like the day previous Josiah had to answer, innumerable questions, at
                                    every place we stopped, respecting the surrender, some of which amused, &amp;
                                    others provoked us exceedingly, it rain'd part of the day &amp; the
                                    only shelter we had was an unbralla, which prevented us from being intirely wet
                                    through. We arrived at <placeName>

                                    rest, which refreshed, &amp; prepared us, for taking the stage the next morning.
                                    We found the stage a good one, fine roads &amp; what was better than either, <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-041-1-082"/> very delightful companions, one Officer in the

                                    on very pleasantly till about 11 o clock, when our stage gave way &amp; we were
                                    obliged to take open waggons as far as where the stage exchanged, here we found a

            <p>This book is based upon extensive research indicated by more than sixty pages of citations and a
                    bibliography of twenty-two pages. Following a chapter on the origins of the Republican party there
                    are sketches of the men regarded as possible nominees for the presidency in 1860. Included are
                    William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Simon Cameron, and Edward Bates, together with less conspicuous
                    men such as William L. Dayton, Cassius M. Clay, Alexander Ramsey. They are shown to have lacked the
                    necessary strength to win the nomination because of their past records and their current political
                    views. Lincoln's success Mr. Luthin discusses under the heading, "The Triumph of
                    Availability." His availability was the result of his conservatism which made him
                    politically attractive in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, states where antislavery sentiment was weak.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>The most prominent candidate [Seward] had strong and concentrated support. … Beyond
                        this strength, already secured, he had nothing to gain, and the leading position was his only so
                        long as his opponents, divided in their loyalties, failed to unite. When they did unite, the
                        leading candidate was dropped, and a lesser known but less controversial. figure was chosen.</p>

            <p>The campaign of 1860 is dealt with in some fifty pages, with conditions described in the states
                    regarded as "safe" for the Republicans and in those held to be
                    "doubtful." Obviously an extended treatment, state by state, was not possible,
                    perhaps not desirable, in such limited space. Because of its importance to Republican victory with
                    thirty-five electoral votes <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> has a chapter devoted to it.</p>
            <p>Certain statements or viewpoints seem to the reviewer to be questionable. In the preface (p. vii) is
                    the statement that "many students of the period are agreed that without Lincoln's
                    victory in November 1860 the war between the sections would not have been precipitated in the
                    following April, …" Does this mean that another Republican would have been less
                    objectionable to the South? Mr. Luthin says (p. 129) that "by 1858 Democrats were shrieking
                    for <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-041-1-085"/> disunion and serving notice that the election of a
                    ‘Black’ Republican to the presidency two years hence would be the
                    ‘overt act’ for secession." It would appear, then, that it was the
                    Republican party, not merely its specific representative, Lincoln, which was so obnoxious. Professor
                    Arthur C. Cole questioned the "menace" of Lincoln's election to slavery
                    in the <hi rend="i">American Historical Review</hi> (July, 1931), an item not included in Professor
                    Luthin's bibliography.</p>
            <p>There is some doubt whether the slavery advocates and nonslaveholders actually were in "a
                    race" (p. 28) to populate <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>. Agitation over <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> probably had greater effect upon opinion outside the territory than in causing people
                    to go there. This has been shown by Professor William O. Lynch in articles on the settlement of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> and by Professor Ralph V. Harlow in an article cited in the same paragraph in which the
                    "race" is mentioned.</p>
            <p>That Lincoln owed his election to the fact that the Democratic party was not united (p. 223) is
                    suggested by the election returns, but an analysis shows that the Lincoln vote was so distributed
                    among populous states that the large minority votes combined would not have given a majority and
                    hence would not have added electoral votes to Lincoln's opponents. (James G. Randall, <hi rend="i">The Civil War and Reconstruction</hi>, 183.)</p>
            <p>It may be questioned, too, whether in a scholarly monograph such words as
                    "Douglasites" (p. 131, <hi rend="i">et passim)</hi>,
                    "Lincolnites" (p. 142, <hi rend="i">et passim)</hi>, "sure-cure"
                    (p. 225), and such expressions as "Crocodile tears" (p. 122), "bandwagon
                    … wheeled out" (p. 164), "galaxy of oratorical stars" (p.
                    179), "bounded about the country" (p. 186), and "Northwestern
                    swordsman" (p. 199), add to the merits of the work. "Talley" (p. 195)
                    should be "tally"; on the same page "electorate" apparently
                    should be "electoral," and on page 227 "respectfully" should be
                    "respectively." "Alabamin" and "Alabamans" are
                    a few sentences apart on page 128, with "Alabamians" in a quotation on the next
                    page.</p>
            <p>These slips do not detract seriously from the value of this competent account of an election that
                    certainly was among the more significant of our history.</p>

            <p>This volume is not a history of the Harmony Society. It does, however, contain useful chapters on the
                    European background, "Harmonie in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>

                    </placeName> (1825-1868). This part of the work is a brief and serviceable historical account.</p>
            <p>The work then becomes an autobiography of the author which is of much less interest to students of
                    Indiana history. This part of the story is concerned with the decline and dissolution of the
                    society, and involves many controversial points. The work has been vigorously criticized <hi rend="i">(The <placeName>
                            <region type="state">Western Pennsylvania</region>
                        </placeName> Historical Magazine</hi>, XXVI, 159-166). It is unnecessary here to discuss these
                    points in any detail. The author is obviously a very egotistical man, a man of ability but of
                    sureness and self-confidence. Since his settlement of affairs for the society seems to have been
                    quite profitable for him and his friends, there seems to have been a motive for telling the story
                    from his point of view. Whatever may be the truth about these matters, this record is an important
                    source for a possible historian of the society, but a biased and an imperfect source. It contains
                    incidents which the author insists he remembers as a child of less than three years of age, and
                    "a strange psychological phenomenon," which the author narrates as a fact (pp.
                    119-128). At another point (p. 196) he claims to have lifted "a weight of 1500
                    pounds." He refers to "my short but brilliant professional musical
                    career" (p. 182). He became badly confused about <placeName>

                    1,015,552 native born, and 176,662 foreign born. These points are sufficient to indicate that the
                    narrative must be read with much caution.</p>
            <p>To what extent these points may affect one's approach to the chapter which describes
                    Harmonie in Indiana will depend on the individual reader. There are, however, a few questionable
                    statements which may be noted in the earlier portion. He refers (p. 46) to the society ginning
                    "the cotton of neighboring farmers and planters." He states (p. 63) <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-041-1-087"/> that the Battle of Fallen Timbers "opened the entire Northwest
                    Territory to white settlement." He has "Coridon" for Corydon, Indiana (p.
                    71). It seems quite unlikely, therefore, that the early chapter in the history of Indiana can be
                    evaluated very highly.</p>
            <p>There are certain features about the story of the Harmony Society that make this work interesting and
                    which make an adequate history very desirable. The society existed for almost a century. It formed
                    three different communities, not one of which was entirely successful, but all of which were
                    probably more successful than is generally realized. The success that attended cooperative effort
                    was rather marked, while ultimate failure or dissolution was probably due to celibacy and the lack
                    of a scheme of recruiting enough new members. It is very interesting to note the author's
                    preference for the freer play allowed individual initiative in the Harmony scheme of communism
                    rather than what he regards as the regimentation of our present administrative procedure.</p>

                    </placeName> extended its authority to the area that is now Indiana, the governor who exercised that
                    authority was Arthur St. Clair. A scholarly life of St. Clair has not been written, and, although
                    this biography has its virtues, it cannot be considered as filling that need. It may call attention
                    to the need and to the opportunity which the subject offers.</p>
            <p>The author has made an extensive study of St. Clair's life. He has previously published <hi rend="i">The Treaty of Greenville</hi> (1894), <hi rend="i">The Peace of Mad Anthony Wayne</hi>
                    (1909), and <hi rend="i">Advancing the <placeName>

                        </placeName> Frontier</hi> (1937). In the present work he described the various phases of his
                    subject's activity in the Seven Years' War, in the Revolution, and in the Old
                    Northwest. He "adopted a sympathetic rather than a critical attitude," but he did
                    not hide the unfavorable traits of St. Clair or the unfortunate occurrences in his life. One
                    exception <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-041-1-088"/> may be noted. He omitted the governor's
                    confirmation of land claims which seems to have been to the advantage of his sons, John Murray St.
                    Clair and Arthur St. Clair, and which seems to have been clearly contrary to law (Francis S.
                    Philbrick, ed., <hi rend="i">The Laws of Indiana Territory, 1801-1809</hi>, pp. lxxviii-lxxix). On
                    the other hand, he discussed at some length the events leading to a court martial of St. Clair
                    during the Revolution, the disastrous campaign of 1791 which also resulted in a court martial, and
                    the contest with the Jeffersonians which led to his removal from the governorship of the Old
                    Northwest Territory.</p>
            <p>The author's conclusions are easily distinguishable from his statement of facts. Although
                    often more favorable than the facts seem to warrant, the reader may discount them as he thinks
                    advisable. The discriminating reader will likely get from the facts a different opinion than the one
                    expressed by the author, and will question the use of the term "Epic" in the
                    title. The epic story is that of the frontiersmen whom St. Clair misunderstood and not the story of
                    St. Clair.</p>
            <p>A few errors of statement, a few typographical errors, and other less important features detract
                    slightly from the general character and trustworthiness of the work. It does not seem to be longer
                    than William H. Smith, <hi rend="i">The Life and Public Services of Arthur St. Clair</hi> (2 vols., <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1882), and it lacks the documentation of this earlier work. On the whole it seems that
                    its chief service may be in calling attention to the need of a new and scholarly reconsideration of
                    St. Clair's life.</p>

            <p>This is easily the most scholarly and refreshing study of Jefferson Davis and his Cabinet that has
                    been written to date. While at times it appears that Dr. Patrick is overly sympathetic with the
                    Confederate President and his advisers, a general estimate of the work justifies the conclusion that
                    he has made a valuable contribution to the history of the South. It has been too long the tendency
                    of writers to attriute the failure of the Confederacy to a mediocre administration <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-041-1-089"/> at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Dr. Patrick's views will be welcomed by those who are concerned with the
                    fundamental causes of the South's defeat.</p>
            <p>The author's treatment of Davis is sympathetic but not partisan. The South turned to its
                    "most suitable citizen" for leadership. The Mississippian was an able and
                    intelligent executive. Despite the fact that he was commander in chief of all the armed forces, and
                    was often blamed for defeats on the field of battle, Davis did not force his views upon the
                    generals. His conscience was often torn between the demand of military expedience and his duty to
                    act within the Constitution. "His inherent weakness as commander in chief was the inability
                    to intervene, with considered judgment, in the Confederacy's military affairs."</p>
            <p>It is erroneous to believe that Jefferson Davis consulted no one in selecting the members of his
                    Cabinet. Although he realized the importance of the geographic factor in the promotion of national
                    solidarity, he also sought the most able men available. The President relied heavily upon
                    recommendations, not only of Congressional delegations, but also from influential private citizens.
                    His appointment of Stephen R. Mallory, however, was contrary to the wishes of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> delegation. Personal friendship did not enter into his appointments. Several members
                    were not known to him personally at the time of their selection. Only James A. Seddon could be
                    classed as an intimate friend when he entered the Cabinet.</p>
            <p>The members of the Cabinet, contrary to popular opinion, were not mere clerks or "spineless
                    yes men." The President sought their advice and respected their opinions. He seldom
                    overruled the opinion of the majority. They were given complete control of the details of their
                    respective departments, and Davis defended them loyally against Congressional and newspaper attacks.
                    That fourteen men occupied the six executive positions over the brief period of four years was no
                    indication of a general lack of harmony between them and the President. Most of them were devoted to
                    their chief and remained friendly after leaving the Cabinet.</p>
            <p>Robert Toombs, the first Secretary of State, was not happy in his post nor were he and Davis
                    congenial. The Georgian has deserved more sympathetic treatment, and it seems rather harsh to say
                    that "Toombs was abundantly <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-041-1-090"/> endowed with brains, but he
                    often made poor use of them." While his foreign policy was not a success, the same can be
                    said of R. M. T. Hunter and Judah P. Benjamin. "No man in the South could have obtained
                    recognition for the Confederacy."</p>
            <p>The War Department was probably the most difficult of the Cabinet posts. There were six secretaries
                    during the war and it appears that Seddon was the most successful. "No other Secretary of
                    War, not even Benjamin, influenced the South's military strategy to the same extent as did
                    Seddon." Benjamin, Attorney General, Secretary of War, Secretary of State, was the
                    South's "handy-man" and a "jack-of-all-trades." He was
                    the President's alter ego, and his greatest value to the Confederacy was as an adviser and
                    aide to the chief.</p>
            <p>Any Confederate Secretary of the Treasury was bound to be unpopular. Christopher G. Memminger had to
                    contend with a people set against taxation. The inherent weakness of the Confederate fiscal policy
                    was the issuance and dependence upon treasury notes for revenue. Memminger never desired this and it
                    was forced upon him by Congress. The Confederate navy was the creation of genius. Mallory possessed
                    the imagination and initiative to accept new trends in naval construction and to experiment with
                    weapons heretofore untried in naval warfare. He built the first ironclads, and experimented with
                    mines, torpedoes, and submarines. John H. Reagan ranks with Mallory as one of the most able men in
                    the Cabinet. The Post Office Department was the orphan child of the Confederacy, and despite
                    tremendous obstacles, the Texan gave the South a fairly adequate postal system.</p>
            <p>Dr. Patrick presents sound evidence that the collapse of the Confederacy was not due to the defects
                    of the Southern civil administration. The Cabinet was composed of the "ablest men in
                    Southern public life." "The one great failure of the Cabinet was the
                    Confederacy's defeat." The author's treatment of each Cabinet department
                    is excellent, and there is an abundance of valuable information for the student of Southern history.
                    The bibliography is unusually good and the index is adequate.</p>

            <p>For "a regional inventory" it is surprising that only one of the authors seems
                    closely identified with "regionalism" or "sectionalism." This is
                    in contrast with the number on "The Old South" (January 23, 1945). Perhaps this is
                    the reason why the general impression a reader gets from the articles is that the <geogName>Ohio
                        Valley</geogName> is a region without a regional point of view. Indeed the issue does not
                    establish the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> as a region and includes two articles which are
                    centered in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> as though that city were in the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName>. The authors were not
                    selected with a view to geographical distribution. Half of them came from the <geogName>Miami
                    Valley</geogName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, four-fifths from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and only one-tenth from each of the states of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and Indiana. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> must feel slighted. It may therefore be suggested that the issue was not well planned,
                    that a wider selection of authors might have produced a better understanding, and a more careful
                    choice of sectional boundaries have yielded evidence of regionalism.</p>
            <p>The opening article denies the existence of regionalism in the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> and
                    contains little that was not better done by Frederick J. Turner in "The Middle
                    West." Heath Bowman offers an interesting but oversimplified explanation of the rise and
                    decline of the Hoosier literary tradition which leaves one with the feeling that he regards it as
                    mostly tradition. The disciplinary value of footnote citation, had there been footnotes, might have
                    slowed Philip Jordan in his remarks about religion and schoolteachers. Obviously he indulged <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-041-1-092"/> his opinions rather than described ascertainable facts, and
                    probably erroneous opinions at that, when he wrote the following sentences: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>When Buckeyes embraced religion, they were apt to shun the "desiccated"
                            theology of the Presbyterians and Congregationalists and whoop it up for days at a time with
                            a jug of corn likker and a ripsnortin' Baptist or Methodist circuit-rider.</p>
                        <p>While they [pioneer pedagogues] might administer liberal doses of "hickory

                            and tobacco and an occasional pull from the jug.</p>
                    </quote>These mar an otherwise good article.</p>
            <p>Clark B. Firestone also slipped a little. "Most of the immigrants [on the <placeName>

                    bibliography is volume two of what is intended to be a series. It covers the months from September,
                    1942, to December, 1943. It includes appraisals of the contributions made by books and articles
                    classified topically and regionally. The appraisals were made by a large number of historians,
                    experts in the field in which they prepared appraisals. Each section or division of the work
                    contains a summary of the contributions of the various books appearing in the field. An interesting
                    evaluation of textbooks in history is a new feature added to this volume. It should prove to be very
                    helpful as far as it goes, and, if continued in future volumes, may become quite significant.
                    Finally a section containing abstracts of unpublished dissertations is included. This should prove
                    to be very useful. An index and list of contributors concludes the work. Students and teachers may

            <p>Two atlases of American history have appeared in the last two years. <hi rend="i">The Atlas of

                    </placeName>: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1943, pp. xi, 360. $10.00), appears to be
                    the most useful historical atlas in the American history field. The maps were drawn under the
                    supervision of one or more historians and each map was developed to illustrate a phase, period, or
                    event. Sixty-three maps are included in the colonial period, fifty-eight cover the history from the
                    beginning of the Revolution to the beginning of the Civil War, while twenty-six illustrate American
                    history from 1861 to 1912. There are none for the years since 1912. Indeed beginning with 1861
                    nothing receives adequate treatment except the Civil War and the Trans-<placeName>

                    military phases of the various wars, except the Spanish-American and World War, I. Although minute
                    criticisms can be made, the outstanding characteristic of the volume is its excellence.</p>

                    picturing a very wide variety of subjects of interest to students <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-041-1-095"/> and teachers of American history. Most of the maps are in black and white with a few in brown,
                    black, and white. If one were to criticize unfavorably, the criticism would perhaps be that the maps
                    are quite small, many not containing the necessary detail that would make them most useful. The
                    material upon which the maps are based is such that it can be shown by three to six degrees of
                    shading or by more or less simple lines. It is likely to prove quite useful, and everyone must be
                    pleasantly surprised at the quantity of maps given for the very reasonable price.</p>
            <p>Interestingly enough, these two atlases are not competitors. The technics, material, and types of
                    subjects are different. They are, therefore, supplementary. Every good library, private or public,
                    should have a copy of each.</p>
            <p>A work, which would be an aid if properly prepared, is so poor that a notice of it in this connection
                    is somewhat questionable. It is a <hi rend="i">Bibliography of County Histories of the 3050 Counties

               </placeName>, 1944, pp. 49. $1.25). The character of the work
                    may be illustrated by a quotation: "Histories have been written of nearly all of the
                    Counties of <placeName>

                    appearance of the above bibliography. In respect to Indiana we are told "County histories
                    have been written in some form or other for every County in the State," but not one is
                    listed.</p>
            <p>The urge to publish should be restrained until the publication can be more complete. There is need
                    for a bibliography of county histories but it should be an actual biblography.</p>

                    rather breezy, little book, with considerable emphasis upon writing and style, and much less upon
                    the problems of <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-041-1-096"/> extracting the truth from imperfect documents
                    and of recognizing error, bias, and misstatements. Very little is included about the necessity of
                    consulting eye-witness accounts rather than investigating writings of all kinds. Ten per cent of the
                    work concerns the making of an index. Many will take exception to the recommendation
                    "Modernize all spelling in quoted passages." The chief advantage of the work lies
                    in the possibility of its being read by those unwilling to read a more substantial work. Most
                    efforts to offer something lighter than the excellent work of C. V. Langlois and Charles Seig-nobos

            <p>Although <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName> was organized in 1801, the first dates in the marriage records are for 1807. Two
                    earlier marriages, John Covert to Rachel Stootsman, September 9, 1802, and Robert Biggs to Ellanor
                    Irwin, October 5, 1802, are recorded in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName> Deed Records, 1:279, 320. During part of the period covered by the following records,
                    the present Harrison, Jefferson, Scott, and Floyd counties were a part of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName>. The residence of the person performing the marriage may provide a clue to the
                    residence of the participants. Patrick Shields and Clement Nance were later residents of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
                    </placeName>; Samuel Smock, John Vawter, and John Ryker resided in that part of Clark which became <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In some cases the date given in the records is the date of the marriage license, while in other cases
                    it is the date of the certificate or marriage returned to the county clerk. In the following list,
                    the former is indicated by "L" and the latter by "C." The first
                    pages of the marriage records are badly torn; some of the names are missing and others are almost
                    illegible. For the first seven marriages, only the brides' names remain. These were: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Mary Carson [date torn]; Elizabeth Carr, L, 3-14-1807; Elizabeth Humphreys [date torn];

                </p>
            <p>From here on the records are almost complete.</p>

            <head>Special Offer of Back Numbers Of The <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine Of History</hi> for Libraries,
                    School Libraries, and Personal Files.</head>
            <p>Libraries and persons who are now regular subscribers or who will become regular subscribers are
                    offered the opportunity of securing back numbers of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                    History</hi> at a low price. The earlier numbers of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> are too rare to
                    be included in this offer, but numerous copies of many back issues which contain useful and valuable
                    articles and documentary material that should be included in every library in Indiana and in many
                    outside the state, and which may be desired by individual subscribers are now made available at a
                    greatly reduced price.</p>
            <p>Beginning with Volume XXIII (1927), the supply of existing numbers with the exception of three
                    issues, is sufficient that these numbers will be offered to our subscribers at twenty-five cents per
                    copy or one dollar per volume. The regular price has been fifty cents per copy or two dollars per
                    volume, and this price will be maintained where the sale is to nonsubscribers. The price of earlier
                    issues will remain at a dollar and a dollar and a half per copy or four dollars and six dollars per
                    volume, depending upon the scarcity of the individual number or volume.</p>
            <p>The editor reserves the right to withdraw this special price at any time. He also reserves the right
                    to withdraw it in respect to any issue when the surplus stock of that issue is exhausted.</p>
            <p>Useful articles are to be found in these issues of the <hi rend="i">Magazine.</hi> The following are
                    some of the important subjects:</p>
