            <p>From the 1870s to the 1930s, the development of business enterprise was widely seen as the one
                    essential ingredient for African-American progress. Yet neither African-American business enterprise
                    nor the political roles of black entrepreneurs have been adequately studied by historians. Accounts
                    of African-American economic hardships during the Great Depression have slighted the important
                    political debates that these hardships produced. Similarly, writings on W. E. B. Du Bois, the black
                    scholar and founder of the twentieth-century civil rights protest tradition, have neglected his
                    distinctive vision of African-American business enterprise.</p>
            <p>Consequently, a little known 1937–1938 dispute between Du Bois and Freeman B. Ransom, an
                    African-American businessman and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> community leader, demands attention. Ransom and Du Bois viewed the proper aims of
                    business enterprise in radically opposing ways. The Ransom-Du Bois dispute provides an opportunity
                    to examine the differing ways these two leaders approached the problems of the Depression as well as
                    how African Americans reconsidered older ideas of black business enterprise and political
                    leadership. Studying the 1930s is acutely important because during that decade faith in business as
                    the basis for African-American leadership was supplanted by political and labor strategies.</p>

            <p>The issues that undergirded the Du Bois-Ransom dispute of 1937–1938 were a reprise of the
                    famous Booker T. Washington-Du Bois debate of the early 1900s.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Du Bois had debated whether blacks should accommodate to America's
                    segregationist racial order. Thirty years later Ransom and Du Bois disagreed on the equally basic
                    question of how much of America's existing social and economic system should be embraced
                    and how much rejected by African Americans.</p>
            <p>On December 18, 1937, Du Bois used his column in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> to criticize the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>-based Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company, the famous African-American hair and
                    beauty products enterprise. The attack was part of Du Bois's long-running critique of what
                    he perceived as the failure of black businesses to address the basic needs of black Americans.
                    Although Du Bois praised the accomplishments of the late "Madame Walker and her hair
                    culture business" as "epoch-making," he attacked the firm:
                    "Since Madame Walker's death the business has fallen, I have been told, mainly
                    into the hands of white capitalists." Further, the company had based itself "on
                    the usual exploitation of labor." Du Bois suggested an alternative vision of how the
                    business might have developed:<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>a little broader knowledge and far-seeing advice might easily have turned the Walker hair
                            culture business during her [Walker's] life into a co-operative enterprise and this
                            co-operation, instead of being simply a group capitalistic movement, could have been given
                            the form of a socialistic mass movement, not only in hair culture but in other lines. What
                            is true of the Walker business can be true of the whole inner economic organization of
                            American Negroes.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    <hi rend="i">Courier</hi>, he angrily protested the attack. "There is not now, or has there
                    ever been," Ransom insisted, "one share of stock of the Mme. C.J. Walker Mfg.
                    Company owned by any white man" or "‘by white
                    capitalists.’" Only "members of the Walker family" had ever
                    held shares in the firm. While Ransom ignored Du Bois's comments about cooperative business
                    enterprise and Du Bois's broader critique <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Emanating from the nation's most prominent black intellectual and appearing in what was the
                    nation's leading African-American newspaper (the <hi rend="i">Courier's</hi> 1938
                    circulation was a quarter million copies a week), Du Bois's allegation that whites
                    controlled the firm contradicted the image that the Walker Company was a company run and owned by
                    African Americans and an employer that created opportunity and self-respect for its black employees
                    and agents.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> And Du Bois was wrong: "white capitalists" did
                    not control the firm.</p>
            <p>Du Bois replied privately to Ransom on December 22, 1937:<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I am sorry that my reference to your company in the ‘<placeName>

                            </placeName> Courier’ did not altogether please you. You will remember that I did
                            not say that the business had fallen into the hands of white capitalists. I said that I had
                            been told it had. Nor was there anything in my statement or intention to decry or injure
                            your business in any way. Most of us, are engaged in work which is directed wholly or in
                            part by white capital. That fact in itself is not at all derogatory. I merely mentioned the
                            rumor in this case because the matter was of importance in the possible development of
                            cooperative business among 118.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> The letter hardly satisfied Ransom. He again wrote Du Bois, demanding a published
                    correction and hinting at a lawsuit. He also scoffed at Du Bois's claim that he meant
                    nothing "derogatory." The purpose of Du Bois's comments on the Walker
                    Company's purported fall to "white capitalists," Ransom believed, was to
                    blame its management for failing to advance African-American economic development. But Du Bois was
                    unmoved by Ransom's protest. In early January, 1938, Du Bois told the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> that he had no plans to apologize or make any admission of error.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two days later, Ransom wrote Du Bois a third letter "to inquire as to just what you plan to
                    do before I take further action in the matter."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Ransom's
                    threat finally moved Du Bois to seek advice from Arthur Spingarn, a lawyer, a top official of the

                    friend. Spingarn warned Du Bois that a court could find his statement libelous and injurious to the
                    Walker Company. At the very least, such a suit would be expensive to defend. Spingarn also told Du
                    Bois that "the moral side of it requires some form of correction."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> With this stern warning from an old friend, Du Bois retreated.</p>
            <p>In the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> of January 23, 1938, Du Bois retracted his claim that white capital
                    controlled the Walker Company: "I am glad to withdraw the statement and I am sorry if what
                    I said did any harm." Du Bois added that he was pleased with the firm's success
                    and with its having remained "under Negro control." This apology ended the
                    exchanges between Ransom and Du Bois. Ransom wrote Du Bois that he considered the matter closed.
                    Privately, Du Bois explained his own reversal by telling the <hi rend="i">Courier's</hi>
                    manager that Ransom had been "obstreperous and I am trying to placate him."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Du Bois had failed to investigate what he had heard about the Walker Company before publishing it and
                    had tried to avoid admitting error. Ransom, understandably, wanted the record set straight. In
                    truth, however, the Du Bois-Ransom dispute went far deeper than the narrow question of fact. The
                    controversy reflected antagonisms born of these leaders’ fundamentally different ideas of
                    the proper function of black business enterprise and their conflicting views of the proper aims of
                    African-American leadership. In order to understand the roots of the dispute, the history of the
                    Walker Company and the careers and political views of Ransom and Du Bois must be examined.</p>
            <p>Ransom adhered to a conservative, Booker T. Washington-inspired vision of black business enterprise,
                    which held that "the race" would advance by following in the footsteps of
                    successful African-American businessmen. (<placeName>

                    the hair and creams for the skin. Her marriage to a <placeName>

                    </placeName> newspaper sales agent, C. J. Walker, produced her business name, Madam C.J. Walker. The
                    marriage soon ended, but the business prospered. Walker attracted customers and recruited a sales
                    force of African-American women—the "Walker agents"—through
                    extensive promotional travels. In 1910, seeking a central location with good access to railroads,
                    she consolidated her business in <placeName>

                    Walker had become one of the early twentieth century's most successful businesswomen and
                    one of the most famous African Americans.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Walker pioneered new ways of marketing consumer products. As the mass consumer age was beginning,
                    Walker grasped what "image" would sell her products, and she projected it
                    forcefully: a company owned and started by a hard working but glamorous African-American woman who
                    had pulled herself up from the cotton fields and wash tubs to become a
                        "millionaire."<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Much of the appeal of Walker's
                    products was that Madam Walker was a woman who seemed to embody her customer's own dreams.
                    Her story of success accorded well with both the reigning national ideology of business enterprise
                    and individual endeavor, as well as with the personal aspirations of her African-American women
                    customers to appear stylish and beautiful.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>Walker also portrayed herself as a progressive employer. "I am endeavoring," she
                    said in 1914, "to provide employment for hundreds of women of my race." Although
                    some ran store-front beauty shops, most Walker agents ran their shops from their homes or sold

            <p>Walker's interests extended beyond business to politics, especially during the last years of
                    her life. In 1917, after the bloody East <placeName>

               </placeName>, race riot (in which white mobs
                    murdered scores of African Americans and burned hundreds of homes), Walker joined a delegation of
                    African Americans that traveled to the White House and presented a petition protesting the
                    lynchings. President Woodrow Wilson refused to see them. Not for another year would Wilson publicly
                    condemn lynchings. And in 1918 Walker was one of eleven African Americans selected by the National
                    Equal Rights League, a militant civil rights group led by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s William Monroe Trotter, to attend the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> peace conference. The delegation aimed to call attention to the rights of black people
                    in America and in Europe's African colonies. As World War I came to an end, Trotter
                    demanded that Wilson add a fifteenth item to his Fourteen Points peace plan: "the
                    elimination of civil, political, and judicial distinctions based on race or color in all
                    nations." Because the State Department denied visas to the Trotter group, Walker never left
                    for Europe. In the spring of 1919, she died at age fifty-one.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>With Walker's death, Ransom's responsibilities with the company grew. Already in
                    charge of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> factory, he now supervised the national network of Walker agents and directed
                    marketing. A Walker Company film, featuring F. B. Ransom, played in "colored"
                    movie houses and was one of the first films ever used to promote commercial products.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> In the 1920s, however, the company began a long decline. In part this resulted from the
                    rise of competitors and imitators in the growing and volatile beauty products industry. Most
                    importantly, after Walker's death, the firm lacked its powerfully symbolic founder, whose
                    extensive promotional travels had consistently spurred sales.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in the 1920s the company constructed what quickly became a major item of expensive
                    overhead: the famous Walker Building, which still stands on Indiana Avenue just west of downtown <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Completed in 1927, the Walker Building was both a remarkable achievement and a
                    tremendous capital investment. A four-story, 48,000 square foot, triangle-shaped structure with
                    polychrome terra cotta trim, the Walker Building is a notable historic and architectural landmark.
                    When it opened, the building housed the Walker Manufacturing Company's plant and offices,

                    Building quickly became the social and civic center of the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the Walker Building offered a restaurant, the "Coffee Pot," open to
                    all customers, as well as perhaps the only non-segregated movie theater in the entire state. The
                    Walker Building provided the black community of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> with a cluster of shops and stores, a social center, a grand ballroom, a theater,
                    doctors’ offices, and, naturally, a Madam C.J. Walker Beauty salon. Indeed, the Walker
                    Building was a precursor to the modern shopping mall: with many retail, food, and entertainment
                    establishments under one roof, it was a place for shopping, seeing friends, and having fun. But like
                    a shopping mall, the Walker Building relied on people spending money, and blacks had very little to
                    spend, especially after the Depression hit. Consequently, Walker Building businesses lost money, and
                    this grand civic monument became a financial drain for the company.</p>
            <p>The fortunes of the Walker Building also appear to explain how Du Bois formed the impression that the
                    Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company was no longer owned by African Americans. The Walker Theatre
                    Company, an entity legally separate from the Walker Manufacturing Company, leased the theater for an
                    annual rent of $15,000, payable to the Walker Manufacturing Company, the
                    building's owner. As early as January, 1930, the Walker Theatre Company owed a large back
                    rent, forcing the Walker Manufacturing Company to find another tenant. The company leased the
                    theater to a white businessman, who "continued to book films and shows of interest to the
                    black <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> community." Since Du Bois visited <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> often on his lecture trips, he undoubtedly heard or observed personally that the Walker
                    Theatre was being run by a white businessman and later conflated the Walker Theatre with the Madam
                    C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> This is the only evident explanation for Du

                            Building and the Walker Theatre, probably several times, on his lecture trips. And Mrs.
                            Frances Stout, who grew up in Ransom's neighborhood, knew the Ransom family, and
                            attended events at the Senate Avenue YMCA, remembers Du Bois visiting Ransom's
                            home, probably earlier than 1937. Mrs. Stout recalls that many African-American speakers
                            from out-of-town were entertained by the Ransom family. Mrs. Stout kindly shared this
                            information with the author at the November, 1991, meeting of the Indiana Historical

                    overlooking the distinction between the Walker Manufacturing Company and other businesses associated
                    with the Walker name. By the late 1930s, almost twenty years after Madam Walker's death,
                    the Walker Building was probably a more visible manifestation of her legacy than was the company
                    itself. Ransom's "open letter" to Du Bois complained that Du Bois had not
                    mentioned "our <hi rend="i">new</hi> million dollar plant here in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            <p>Ransom's own leadership and civic activities extended well beyond the Walker Company. He was

                    </placeName> African-American community, as well as a practicing attorney. While a Republican in the
                    World War I era, during the 1930s Ransom became a Democrat and encouraged African-American voters to
                    leave the Republican party for the Democratic party of F#2 D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. As
                    historian John Hope <placeName>

            <p>In the 1930s and 1940s, Ransom held patronage appointments to the board of trustees for the Indiana
                    School for the Blind under three Democratic governors and served as its treasurer as well. And in
                    1938, some months after his dispute with Du Bois, Ransom was elected to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis City</settlement>
                    </placeName> Council, serving one term. He served on several mayoral committees, on the Interracial

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and as a trustee of Bethel A.M.E. Church. At the time of the Du Bois dispute, Ransom
                    was vice-president of the National Negro Business League and a member of the Senate Avenue YMCA
                    board. In the last few years of his life, Ransom served on the <placeName>

                    fundamental to blacks’ oppression. African Americans, Ransom said in his 1924
                    commencement address at the Tuskegee Institute, "make the mistake of over-emphasizing our
                    real and fancied wrongs and under-emphasizing our opportunity in this country." America,
                    Ransom held, was "the land of opportunity and her beckoning hand is extended to black and
                    white alike." He professed an "abiding faith in the Constitution" and
                    "the fair-mindedness of the American white man." The idea that African Americans
                    protested mere "fancied wrongs" would have enraged Du Bois, who was acutely aware
                    of the mob violence, denial of voting rights, and housing and employment discrimination that black
                    people in America suffered. But Ransom felt his views best advanced "the race." As
                    Ransom told the Tuskegee graduates, echoing <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Ransom had likewise opposed Madam Walker's participation in Monroe Trotter's plans
                    to bring African-American protest to the <placeName>

                    mind that you have a large business," unlike Trotter's other associates, who
                    "have nothing." Indeed, "There are many ways in which your business can
                    be circumscribed and hampered, so as to practically put you out of business."<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Ransom voiced the same caution that induced <placeName>

                    </placeName> to shun public political activity as inherently dangerous and unproductive.</p>
            <p>But Ransom lived into the 1930s and 1940s, when African-Americans’ political options
                    became far broader than in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s time. As the New Deal expanded the role of government, black Americans had
                    greater opportunities to demand equality and assert a political role than they had had since the end
                    of Reconstruction. Together the New Deal and the Depression enabled political effectiveness in the
                    public realm to displace private business ownership as the primary basis for African-American
                    leadership on the local level. The new political landscape of the 1930s, historian Walter Weare has
                    noted, allowed local African-American businessmen and erstwhile Bookerites like Ransom "to
                    move from business leadership to civic leadership," a watershed "transition in

                    </placeName> electorate, which gave black Democrats some leverage within the party. During that
                    decade, historian Emma Lou Thornbrough has noted, "the Negro vote was important in
                    supplying the margin of victory to the Democrats in successive elections."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Hence Ransom, by joining the Democrats and shifting priorities from business toward
                    political action, typified a major change in black life during the 1930s.</p>
            <p>In 1935 Ransom pressed the Democratic administration of Governor Paul McNutt to support a bill
                    requiring the <placeName>

                    </placeName> school board to provide free transportation for black students forced by the board to
                    attend segregated schools. Ransom complained that some black students had to walk as far as eight
                    miles a day to attend high school. He urged his party to support the bill, though its sponsor was a
                    Republican. Ransom, at once playing the role of a Democratic loyalist and black community leader,
                    added that he did not "think much of the author of this bill" and wondered if it
                    could "be taken away from him" and introduced by a Democrat. But he insisted that
                    it must be passed regardless of whether a Republican or Democrat sponsored it. Indeed, "I
                    will feel it very keenly if it does not" pass, Ransom warned, hoping to seize an advantage
                    from the Democrats’ reliance on black voters. The bill passed.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

                    blood of our democracy, and if democracy is to survive, our program of education must ever grow.
                    Colored students, then, must be accorded a full participation in this program."<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Ransom knew that segregated schools greatly limited the vocational and

                    the 1930s: they concurred on the need for a less onerous school segregation.</p>
            <p>As a Democrat, Ransom urged state and local officials to minimize racial exclusion and to employ more
                    African Americans in government jobs and in a greater variety of positions. Ransom claimed that the
                    party's continuation of segregation of state employees by race and its denial of a fair
                    share of patronage appointments to blacks would carry a high electoral cost. Ransom told Governor
                    McNutt and his patronage director, Pleas Greenlee, that Indiana was as bad as the southern states in
                    failing to appoint blacks to high salary state jobs. "The Democrats are making a grave
                    mistake," Ransom said, "in not finding a few places paying reasonable salaries
                    that the negro [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] can point to with pride." Indiana Republicans
                    boasted that they had appointed more African Americans to well paying jobs than had McNutt. Pleading
                    that "My concern is in the interest of the Democratic Party," Ransom warned that
                    McNutt's administration did "not realize to what extent Republicans are attempting
                    to win back the Negro vote."<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ransom quietly complained that the State Unemployed Bureau had no positions whatsoever open to black
                    applicants, a form of discrimination not likely, he implied, to be forgotten on election day. Ransom
                    also intervened on behalf of African-American state employees who suffered discrimination on the job
                    and on behalf of those laid off by the state.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> In short, during the 1930s
                    Ransom lobbied to improve blacks‘ occupational and educational opportunities in Indiana,
                    using his position in the Democratic party to plead against the Hoosier system of segregation. But
                    aside from small gestures and a few low-paying jobs, Ransom's efforts in the party achieved
                    little: "the Democratic organization in Indiana during the New Deal era did little that was
                    conspicuous in behalf of its Negro supporters," historian Emma Lou Thornbrough has
                        concluded.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Yet Ransom appears to have given little thought to other
                    political strategies or economic reforms. Consequently, Ransom stood in sharp contrast to the Du
                    Bois of the 1930s.</p>

            <p>During the century's first decade, Du Bois became the one essential figure in the forging of
                    an interracial progressive movement for racial equality in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Du Bois called for full civil and legal equality of the races at
                    the very time that the South was enacting segregationist statutes. A federal judiciary dominated by
                    conservative-activists sanctioned southern states’ denial of voting rights to African
                    Americans, and white mobs were lynching nearly two hundred African Americans per year. Du
                    Bois's proud insistence on blacks’ full civil and legal equality, first voiced
                    when most white Americans believed in their innate "racial" superiority, became
                    the fundamental demand on which the enduring twentieth-century tradition of African-American civil
                    rights protest arose. Du Bois's protests and writings from the first years of the century
                    inspired a small group of white socialists and progressives who founded the National Association for
                    the Advancement of Colored People in 1910. Du Bois worked for the NAACP for twenty-four years,
                    founding and editing its influential magazine, the <hi rend="i">Crisis</hi>.</p>
            <p>At the turn of the century Du Bois had accepted the consensus of the small African-American
                    "middle class" that racial salvation must be achieved primarily through business
                    enterprise. This belief was fully consistent with his original notion of a "Talented Tenth
                    black leadership group.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> As Du Bois challenged Booker T. Washington on
                    questions of political rights and black education, he still believed in the central importance of
                    black business enterprise. Indeed, Du Bois, not <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, first conceived of the National Negro Business League, established in 1900.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> But in the early 1930s Du Bois, in one of the major watersheds of his long
                    career, radically altered his belief in collective advancement through the success of
                    "talented" African Americans: without entirely abandoning the idea of an elite
                    black leadership class, he encased it in an idiosyncratic socialist program. For in the 1930s, Du
                    Bois concluded that the now much larger black middle class had failed to rise to the demands of
                    group leadership.</p>
            <p>In the 1930s Du Bois addressed the problems of failed black leadership and the crisis of the
                    Depression by arguing for cooperative African-American businesses and community-controlled schools,
                    hospitals, and other institutions. Each would involve the participation of elite as well as less
                    privileged African Americans. <list type="footnotes">

                    and structured to induce elite African Americans to serve "the race" as a whole.
                    Similarly, Du Bois questioned the viability of the NAACP's continued reliance on a middle
                    class leadership and called for a shift of power from the national office to the local branches.
                    While these ideas of black leadership and social class differences were influenced by Marxism, Du
                    Bois's views in the 1930s differed greatly from those of socialists and Marxists, and he
                    forcefully rejected their political strategies.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

            <p>In 1934 Du Bois left the NAACP and the <hi rend="i">Crisis</hi>, primarily because he and the
                    NAACP's top leadership no longer agreed on the primacy of civil rights protest in the
                    struggle for racial equality. As the Depression unfolded, Du Bois increasingly argued that economic
                    subordination lay at the root of African-American oppression. He urged the NAACP to adopt his
                    economic program, which envisioned a race-based autonomous socialism for African Americans. This
                    community socialism or "cooperative commonwealth," would, he hoped, unite the
                    talents and labor of all African Americans—businessmen and laborers, teachers and
                    domestics, scholars and sharecroppers—in a common struggle. Such a "Negro Nation
                    within the Nation" would be guided, Du Bois insisted, by the selfless pursuit of the
                    collective good of "the race."<hi rend="sup">39</hi> But the NAACP's
                    leadership refused to alter its civil rights program and rejected Du Bois's economic ideas.
                    It also moved to restrict Du Bois's right to criticize the NAACP in the <hi rend="i">Crisis</hi>. These disputes culminated in Du Bois's resignation from the NAACP in June,
                    1934. Spending the next decade at <placeName>

                    lectures, newspaper columns, and other writings.</p>
            <p>Du Bois had long recognized the achievements of the Walker Company. Even his December, 1937, <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> column had praised it for creating "perhaps 13,000 [Negro] jobs:
                    beauty shops and hair pressing parlors, where women unemployed or forced into menial service are
                    able to make a livelihood and approach the status of almost independent entrepreneurs."
                    After Madam Walker's death in 1919, Du Bois wrote a <hi rend="i">Crisis</hi> obituary that

            <p>In the 1930s, however, Du Bois complained that virtually all African-American businesses, including
                    the Walker firm, had failed to promote the kind of autonomous economic development that he thought
                    essential for African-Americans’ health and survival. The Walker Company had not turned
                    itself into "a cooperative enterprise" promoting "a socialistic mass
                    movement." Business owners, Du Bois charged, had failed to use their "tremendous
                    power" to serve society.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Du Bois's perspective on the purposes of business enterprise differed radically from that of
                    any successful entrepreneur. He wanted African-American businessmen and women to act as community
                    leaders by converting their privately owned businesses into philanthropic community institutions.
                    Profits from all black-owned businesses should be invested for community purposes, not consumed by
                    individual owners. He believed that most African-American business owners wanted to serve the
                    community while bettering themselves, but typically their pursuit of individual gain undercut their
                    contributions to the community. Consequently, the radical scholar-activist wanted to democratize
                    something that had rarely been subject to democratic governance and hardly existed to serve communal
                    or democratic ends: business enterprise.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Du Bois had no detailed plan for how his idea of cooperative business enterprise among African
                    Americans could be realized in practice. His vision of socialism-in-one-community was based more on
                    an appreciation of the depths of the crisis facing black America in the Depression than on a
                    realistic assessment of what was politically and economically obtainable. Even the most
                    community-minded black business owners objected to Du Bois's program. To have supported it
                    would have been to abandon their class identity. More crucially, even if black business leaders had
                    embraced Du Bois's economic program, tremendous difficulties stood in the way of
                    implementation. Neither black businessmen nor African Americans as a whole had the capital to
                    finance the type of economic development Du Bois envisioned. This was especially true during the
                    1930s, when the greatest economic crisis in world history prevented countless African Americans from
                    even feeding their families <list type="footnotes">

                    people could finance the kinds of cooperative businesses he envisioned.</p>
            <p>Yet Du Bois was convinced that his plan was essential for combating black poverty and joblessness,
                    two problems the Depression exacerbated. The Depression not only devastated employment and living
                    standards for African Americans, it also wiped out a generation of black business development
                        overnight.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Only the advent of widespread, if still inadequate, public
                    relief prevented extensive starvation in the black community. In <hi rend="i">An American
                    Dilemma</hi>, Gunnar Myrdal estimated that in 1935 "around half of all Negro families in
                    the North were on relief."<hi rend="sup">44</hi> By putting most black businessmen out of
                    business, the Depression destroyed the credibility of African-American businessmen as a leadership
                    class.</p>
            <p>Economic collapse also convinced Du Bois that a drastic restructuring of the economic life of black
                    America was inevitable. Du Bois's economic program was an attempt to shape this
                    restructuring. Satisfied that capitalism could not provide even the bare necessities of life for
                    all, Du Bois in the early 1930s concluded that economic depression was, together with racial
                    prejudice, forcing African Americans to intolerable levels of poverty and joblessness. Du Bois
                    feared that many black people would be forever left outside the labor market and below the level of
                    subsistence unless African Americans united in an extraordinary effort to save themselves. Du Bois
                    forcefully argued that a cooperative economy in the black community was the only way for African
                    Americans to resolve their economic crisis and to survive as a people.</p>
            <p>In the very <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> column in which he apologized to the Walker Company, Du Bois
                    pressed his economic program: "There is no greater service that can be rendered to a group
                    than the service of business men." "Nevertheless," he added,
                    "perhaps the greatest mistakes of our industrial society have arisen among these servants
                    of the public." Therefore, society must "save and encourage" business
                    owners by regulating "their activities." Du Bois judged that this would
                    "be accomplished in the future by the gradual socialization" of business and
                    wealth. Moreover, "the movement toward socialized business is starting throughout the
                    world" and "American Negro businessmen ought to lead in this and not <list type="footnotes">

                    Du Bois still pushed for African-American cooperative business enterprise—the very point
                    on which his economic program most directly challenged Ransom.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Du Bois, "socialization" of the economy meant democratic and popular control
                    over society's wealth and investments. African Americans, lacking a highly stratified class
                    structure, were, Du Bois argued, uniquely well-suited to pioneer a communal socialistic economy.
                    Such a radical change in African-American economic life required, Du Bois said, the active support
                    of African-American business leaders. This, to Du Bois, was the real tragedy of firms like the
                    Walker Company: despite remaining in black hands, they had not built an independent or prosperous
                    economy for the black community. Nor had they promoted what Du Bois considered a meaningful economic
                    education for African Americans.</p>
            <p>Almost alone among radical black intellectuals in the 1930s, Du Bois saw the prospect of a socialist
                    America as highly problematic for African Americans. A successful socialist movement, comprised of
                    America's white working class majority, Du Bois feared, could be just as racially
                    exclusionary as American capitalism. Nor did Du Bois, unlike most radical intellectuals during the
                    Depression, see an interracial labor movement as a viable strategy for African Americans. For
                    decades he applauded efforts to unite black and white workers, but in the 1930s Du Bois concluded
                    that such efforts were quite unlikely to overcome whites‘ racial bias.
                    African-Americans’ sole choice, he wrote privately in 1933, was "annihilation by
                    American capitalism piecemeal or racial organization in self-defense." Since
                    "[anti-]Negro prejudice still lives," Du Bois argued, there was no chance that
                    "Communism" or trade unionism could resolve the economic crisis in ways favorable
                    to African Americans.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> But despite his pessimistic view of a hypothetical

            <p>Rejecting the labor strategy of the left and placing no hope in restored capitalist prosperity, Du

                    for the black community. As a practical response to the economic crisis African Americans faced in
                    the Depression, Du Bois's scheme was sorely lacking. But if viewed as part of a debate on
                    the possibilities of African-American freedom and security in America, then Du Bois's 1930s
                    ideas stand as a telling critique of what he thought were the equally feeble efforts of conservative
                    businessmen, liberal reformers, and Marxists to address racial oppression and poverty in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Although Ransom never formally commented on Du Bois's economic program, he surely shared the
                    disdain for it expressed by other black entrepreneurs. African-American businessmen saw Du
                    Bois's scheme as a far-fetched and utopian attack on their own enterprise and way of life.
                    As Ransom wrote in his open letter, "I ask you why, Dr. Du Bois, writers such as you seek
                    always to decry and misrepresent Negro business?"<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ransom and Du Bois each believed in racial solidarity and in group leadership, but they sharply
                    disagreed on what goals should be pursued through that solidarity and leadership. Their political
                    animosities shaped the vehemence of Ransom's protest of Du Bois's factual mistake
                    and contributed to Du Bois's reluctance to admit error. Yet the Du Bois-Ransom dispute of
                    1937–1938, while arising from profound disagreements on the most basic questions
                    confronting African Americans in the 1930s, never matured into a real debate over political ideas or
                    strategies. Neither Ransom nor Du Bois addressed one another on fundamental questions of
                    African-American economic strategy, political leadership, or business enterprise. Apparently neither
                    Du Bois nor Ransom saw their dispute as an opportunity to attract political support.</p>
            <p>Du Bois, however, did campaign for his economic program during the 1930s. Ironically, his dispute
                    with Ransom stemmed from Du Bois's rebuttal of an independent Marxist writer, Benjamin
                    Stolberg, who, writing in <hi rend="i">The Nation</hi>, had blasted Madam Walker's
                    "hair unkinking process" as an "anthropological insult." Du Bois
                    replied in the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> that "it is no more an ‘anthropological
                    insult’ for one person to have hair straightened than for another to have his hair
                    curled." But Du Bois's real dispute with Stolberg involved far deeper issues of
                    economics and politics. Stolberg held the view, common among American Marxists of the 1930s, that
                    "labor consciousness" alone could save "the colored world" but
                    that African <list type="footnotes">

                    retarded the black working class from seeing this Marxian truth.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Du Bois's view, Stolberg underestimated the depth and power of racial bias among white
                    Americans and slighted the constructive value of African-American solidarity. But Du Bois respected
                    Stolberg as a fellow participant in the on-going and multi-sided 1930s debate on the economic future
                    of the African-American people. Replying to Stolberg in several of his December, 1937, <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> columns, Du Bois argued that his own program of a racebased economic strategy was
                    superior to both the Marxist panacea of Stolberg and the capitalism-as-usual approaches of
                    African-American business. Rejecting Stolberg's attack on Walker, Du Bois made his own very
                    different criticisms, thereby using the Walker Company to polemicize for his economic program.
                    Ransom responded with his "open letter" to Du Bois.</p>
            <p>However, Ransom addressed none of the broad issues debated by Du Bois and Stolberg. Nor, evidently,
                    did Ransom ever participate in this far-reaching intellectual debate on the political and economic
                    future of black Americans. The contentious ideas of radicals, intellectuals, trade unionists,
                    communists, and socialists of all types did not engage the Indiana businessman. In the 1930s these
                    groups constituted an important and sizable milieu, but Ransom had little contact with them. Ransom
                    was preoccupied with his own responses to the black economic and leadership crisis of the Depression
                    and with his pursuit of political opportunities opened up by the New Deal. Consequently, once Du
                    Bois publicly admitted that the Walker Company had <hi rend="i">not</hi> "fallen into the
                    hands of white capitalists," Ransom saw further exchanges with the radical scholar as
                    pointless. Likewise, Du Bois deemed a potential debate with the <placeName>

                    </placeName> businessman as mattering infinitely less than the debates over strategy already raging
                    on the left and among African-American intellectuals.</p>

            <p>DeWitt C. Markle was twenty-four years old when he marched to war with the 57th Indiana Volunteer
                    Infantry. Through a combination of luck and the civic conscience of a <placeName>

                    </placeName> resident a fragment of Markle's diary of war experiences has survived. This
                    remnant, printed below, contains periodic entries for early January to late September, 1863, and
                    suggests that it may have been part of an extensive journal. The twenty small leaves that did
                    survive of this diary were discovered inserted between the pages of an old book purchased at an
                    auction by James Reed of Anderson, Indiana. Reed generously donated the manuscript to the Indiana
                    Room of the Anderson Public library where it is now on file. Although the manuscript lacked any
                    signature that would directly identify the diarist, there are enough clues of known residents and

                    reveal that Markle is among the many wounded huddled around fires in the cold winter rain, awaiting
                    the surgeons. Readers discover in subsequent entries that Markle was one of the lucky ones whose
                    limb did not require amputation. The entries descend from this dramatic opening to more routine
                    descriptions regarding his treatment in <placeName>

                    painful recuperation. His convalescence period coincides with a dramatic shift in the treatment and
                    employment of disabled soldiers returning from the front.</p>
            <p>From Fort Sumter to mid-1863, the North proved itself woefully unprepared for the magnitude of the
                    war. Large numbers of combat casualties and an even larger number of soldiers disabled by illness
                    and disease poured back into Indiana in direct proportion to the war's escalation. The
                    evolution to total war was much quicker than the North's capacity to react. Consequently,
                    the first two years of the conflict were marked by a tremendous waste of available manpower. Because
                    the North was unable to provide sufficient treatment facilities—similar to the one at New <placeName>

                    manpower was so alarming that various half-measures were adopted in an effort to utilize the
                    disabled in secondary assignments on the home front. By a process of bureaucratic evolution the
                    Veteran Reserve Corps (more familiarly known as the "Invalid Corps") was born on
                    April 28, 1863—roughly midway through Markle's convalescence. Markle's
                    many references to delays, examinations, furloughs, and reexaminations reveal the many obstacles
                    that had to be overcome before the Veteran Reserve Corps accomplished its purpose of fully utilizing
                    disabled soldiers.</p>
            <p>In his postwar report, Indiana's Adjutant General William Henry Harrison Terrell explained
                    that the disabled were divided into two main categories: those capable of carrying muskets and those
                    so severely disabled as to be capable of performing only light clerical duties. Markle's
                    wound was severe enough, evidently, to place him in the latter category. Of great interest is
                    Terrell's description of the Veteran Reserve Corps members’ duties. Their
                    assignments "consisted principally in guarding rebel prisoners, assisting the Provost
                    Marshals in enforcing the enrollment and draft, arresting deserters, escorting recruits, drafted men
                    and substitutes to the front, keeping order at home, and crushing conspiracies of rebel sympathizers
                    in the North… ." This last comment may explain Markle's occasional
                    references to inspecting "rebel mail." While stationed in <placeName>

                    </placeName> Markle resided, at least temporarily, at the "Soldiers'
                    Home." The home, established in 1862, was erected to provide lodging and hospital care to

                        and its pitfalls, they also in recent years have accommodated that understanding to a growing
                        appreciation of the evidence of oral history, which, as in the case of the reminiscences that
                        Herndon collected, frequently provides information that is otherwise irretrievable. See Ronald

                    June 5, 1865, he addressed a letter, essentially in the blind, to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to "some good Union lawyer," apparently inquiring at the county seat

                    </placeName> was Monday, September 12. It was spent in Gentryville where he talked at length with
                    Nathaniel Grigsby, who was to be his "old guide and companion," on most of his <placeName>

                    </placeName> travels. Indeed Herndon seems to have stayed at Grigsby's home. Obviously
                    flattered by the attention paid to his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> connection, Grigsby could be nothing but laudatory of the young Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in spite of the bitterness that had reportedly existed between the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Grigsby families. Grigsby certainly was authoritative; he had attended school with
                    Abraham and Sarah <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and clearly remembered lessons learned and books read there, and Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s studious habits. His recollections of both Thomas and Nancy Hanks <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> were quite detailed, and his inclination was to compare one to the other; he considered
                    Nancy Hanks the superior of the parents, known "for the extraordinary strength of her
                    mind," while Thomas <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> was "always doing but doing nothing great… ."</p>
            <p>Grigsby was the first of three Indiana informants to insist that the young <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> "did drink his dram as well as all others did, preachers and Christians

                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName> wilderness, and he was the first of several to maintain that in his Indiana youth <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> leaned toward Jacksonian Democracy. He was also the first to tell Herndon of the
                    "Chronicles of Reuben," a rather acerbic satire written in Old Testament language,
                    which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> had aimed at Grigsby's own family, and over which a fight had taken place
                    between William Grigsby and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s stepbrother John D. Johnston. "It hurt us then, but its all over
                    now," said Nathaniel Grigsby to Herndon. Grigsby might as well have owned up to knowing
                    about the Chronicles, for they were well remembered all over the neighborhood, "better than
                    the Bible—better than Watts's hymns," as Joseph Richardson would later
                    tell Herndon. This was far from the last time that Herndon would hear about them. But in spite of
                    the chronicles, "There is now no family in the broad land who after this loved <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>

                    profitable time with Mrs. Elizabeth Crawford and some other respondents. Turnham, like Nat Grigsby,
                    was to be a continuous correspondent of Herndon's, and as with Grigsby, his recollections
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s early schooling were valuable. Though six years older than <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Turnham had hunted and fished and attended school with him. He said that in school <placeName>

                    was one of several to note that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> preferred studying to physical work, acknowledging at the same time that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a diligent student. His slightly greater age allowed Turnham to have something like
                    an adult perspective on Thomas <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, whose competence as a cabinetmaker Turnham respected. It was to Turnham that Thomas <placeName>

                    accurately to his friends after the fact, and he also claimed to have made available to <placeName>

                    </placeName> was a constant undertone in most of Turnham's recollection. After dining with

                    temperance. Wood claimed that some early articles written by <placeName>

                    went no further on account of the poem's smuttiness. She promised to observe propriety by
                    giving the rest of the poem to her daughter-in-law, who would in turn tell it to her son who then
                    would write it to Herndon. An actual copy of the Chronicles had recently been discovered in
                    Gentryville, just before Herndon's trip to Indiana. As he told Jesse Weik much later,

            <p>But the most memorable day of Herndon's visit seems to have been the previous Wednesday,
                    September 14, when early in the morning Nat Grigsby took him to see the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> farm and the grave of Nancy Hanks <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and then to Little Pigeon Meeting House, where Aaron and Sarah <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> Grigsby were buried. Near the church he drank from a spring, "out of which Abe
                    had kneeled and drank a thousand times." With a romantic's sensitivity to the
                    particulars of nature, Herndon filled his account of the trip with descriptions of the look of the
                    area, of its hills, its timber, its springs and streams. "All is a dense
                    forest—wild and grand," he wrote at one point. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s mother's gravesite, the normally freethinking Herndon seems almost
                    to have been transfigured. A sentimental man in a sentimental time, he nonetheless was never again
                    to record having been so moved during his researches. "God bless her if I could breathe
                    life into her again I would do it," he wrote of the experience: "Could I only
                    whisper in her Ear—‘Your son was Presdt—of the U.S. from 1861 to
                    186[5],’ I would be satisfied. I have heard much of this blessed, good woman. I stood
                    bare headed in reverence at her grave. I can't say why—yet I felt in the
                    presence of the living woman translated to another world. ‘God bless her,’
                    said her Son to me once and I repeat that which Echoes audibly in my soul—‘God
                    bless her.‘" Curious and somewhat aggrieved that not only was Nancy Hanks <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s grave not marked but also that there was disagreement over which grave in
                    the small plot was actually hers, Herndon nonetheless felt personally privileged to have visited the
                    site. He wrote, "After looking at the grave and Contemplating in silence the mutations of
                    things—death—immortality—God, I left, I hope, the grave, a better
                    man—at least if but for one moment."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and had looked up to him as a kind of preceptor. He remembered <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s great strength, maintaining that he could carry "what 3 ordinary
                    men would grunt &amp; sweat at." But more impressive was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s studious-ness. Richardson recalled that in his copy book, young Abraham had
                    written:</p>
            <q>
                    <p>"Good boys who to their books apply</p>
                    <p>"Will make great men by &amp; by."</p>
                </q>
            <p>Though Richardson never forgot the advice, to Romine such a sentiment was unimpressive. Never denying <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s physical prowess, Romine is nonetheless responsible for a celebrated
                    description of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s aversion to work: he "was awful lazy; he worked for
                    me—was always reading and thinking … didn't love to work but did
                    dearly love his pay," which can certainly be taken as an expression of the premium
                    generally placed on physical rather than mental achievement on this and most other frontiers.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herndon doubtless could have ranged even further than he did in finding informants. With the
                    exception of Romine, his interviewees tended to be laudatory toward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and proud of their association with him. Herndon was probably too reliant on Wartmann
                    in making initial contacts, and Wartmann's inclination to refer him to Republicans seems to
                    have kept him away from male members of the numerous Gentry clan, Jacksonian Democrats who
                    nonetheless knew <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> well and whose perspectives might have been at variance with much of what he collected.
                    Nat Grigsby's outspoken partisanship might also have been a limiting influence.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the major payoff from the journey was a wealth of previously unknown information about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s essentially undocumented early life. Furthermore, Herndon's
                    developing strong impression of the primitive and frequently violent character of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s early social environment must also have been affected by the still

                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>

            <p>Sweeping in scope, and comprehensive in content, this survey of Indian-white relations in the Great
                    Lakes and northern Ohio Valley investigates the interaction between the tribes and the French,
                    British, and Americans and asserts that the French and Indians intially created a "middle
                    ground," a relationship encompassing political, economic, and social ties maintained
                    "through rituals and ceremonials based on cultural parallels and congruencies, inexact and
                    artificial as they originally may have been" (p. 93). Richard White argues that throughout
                    the French period, although "European goods had become an integral part of Algonquian
                    life" (p. 1401, the tribes were not materially dependent upon them, and the exchange of
                    commodities through the fur trade reflected political and ceremonial obligations as much as economic
                    necessity. In turn, the political relationship between the French and most of the tribes was based
                    upon Algonquian concepts of fatherhood, although the French unsuccessfully attempted to incorporate
                    the tribes into a more conventional European political alliance.</p>
            <p>Not surprisingly, in the decades following the French and Indian War this middle ground suffered
                    considerable erosion. British officials refused to participate in the distribution of gifts and the
                    ceremonialism that characterized the French-Indian relationship, while British settlers, who
                    intruded into the upper Ohio Valley, "did not believe their lives depended upon good
                    relations with Indians" (p. 317). During the American Revolution British leaders, reliant
                    upon Algonquian military support attempted to reconstitute part of the older relationship, but their
                    efforts achieved only limited success.</p>
            <p>White suggests that in the decades following the Treaty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> Algonquian villagers residing in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and Michigan attempted to forge a confederacy to confront the onrushing
                    Americans, but because the Indians "lacked the intimate ties that bound a village, and
                    lacked fathers (leaders of stature, Indian or European) to mediate disputes" (p. 441), the
                    confederacy proved <pb n="148" id="VAA4025-089-2-056"/> unsuccessful. Meanwhile, the
                    tribesmen's reliance upon the British for logistical support proved tenuous since British
                    leaders in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> were tied to larger political interests and believed that the confederacy lacked viable
                    leadership. Finally, White argues, religious leaders such as the Shawnee Prophet paralleled
                    contemporary American concepts of race and culture, making Americans into
                    "other-than-human-persons … children of the Great Serpent" (p. 507),
                    while Tecumseh desperately attempted to reconstruct "Indian republics" and
                    confederacies that had so often failed in the past. But they failed, and by the early nineteenth
                    century the middle ground had completely disappeared, forcing the Indians to decide between the
                    "stark choices of assimilation and otherness" (p. 518).</p>
            <p>This is a very complex book whose thesis of a "middle ground" offers a valuable
                    model for the exploration of the Indian-French relationship. Indeed, most scholars who have examined
                    this interaction have described facets of this relationship, but White's analysis is much
                    more comprehensive. Since he covers almost two centuries, White has been forced to integrate a very
                    broad spectrum of conditions and events into his survey. This integration is both the
                    volume's strength and its weakness. Certainly scholars whose particular area of expertise
                    is not the Indian people of the Old Northwest will find that this book provides a wonderful
                    framework for assembling a veritable jigsaw of complex Indian-European and intertribal
                    relationships. But specialists may argue that not quite all of the pieces fit. For example, White
                    argues that the Fox Wars provide "the basic primer for alliance politics" (p.
                    1491, and that they were primarily intertribal conflicts (rather than warfare between the French and
                    the Foxes) which began at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1710. Undoubtedly the conflicts were intertribal in nature, but there is very good
                    evidence to suggest that they originated in Wisconsin during the seventeenth century. Some scholars
                    may question White's assessment of La Demoiselle and William Wells or his statement that
                    the "new generation [of village chiefs who emerged during the American Revolution] were far
                    more parochial and less sophisticated than alliance chiefs of a generation before" (p.
                    379). These are relatively minor questions of historical interpretation and are indicative of the
                    problems encountered in integrating such a plethora of individuals and events into a meaningful
                    synthesis.</p>
            <p>More important however are problems inherent in the chronological scope of the volume.
                    White's depiction of the middle ground is a masterful piece of historical analysis and
                    provides a superb framework for understanding the complex relationship between the French and the
                    Indians; but his final chapters, in which he argues that the Indians and British officials such as
                    William Johnson attempted to recreate a "new middle ground" in the half century
                    following Pontiac's Rebellion are much less convincing. As <pb n="149" id="VAA4025-089-2-057"/> White illustrates, after 1770 the British and American settlers who
                    invaded the West proceeded "in a direction opposite from that taken by the French
                    villagers" (p. 341), and although the tribes-people may have longed for the middle ground
                    of their fathers, they now were faced with new circumstances which precluded any accommodation.
                    White describes the ill-fated attempts of the villagers to form a confedracy during the 1790s and
                    the rise of Tecumseh and the Shawnee Prophet as efforts by the Indian communities to construct
                    meaningful new patterns of interaction, but his arguments for the period after 1770 are less
                    convincing.</p>
            <p>Superbly documented, this volume reflects both the breadth and depth of White's research.
                    Indeed, the text is buttressed by lengthy expository footnotes containing discussions of
                    White's analysis of both primary and secondary materials. Unfortunately, however, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>
                    </placeName> University Press chose not to include a bibliography, and readers who are interested in
                    White's sources sometimes will be forced to search back through pages of such documentation
                    before encountering the initial citation.</p>
            <p>Scholars may disagree with some of White's conclusions, but any historian or anthropologist
                    seriously interested in the tribes of the Old Northwest will be forced to come to terms with this
                    volume. It is unquestionably one of the most significant studies of the Indian people in the Old
                    Northwest to emerge since the advent of the "new Indian history" and perhaps ranks
                    with Anthony F. C. Wallace's <hi rend="i">The Death and Rebirth of the Seneca</hi> (1969)

            <p>The progressive era continues to intrigue historians as they struggle to define the meaning of
                    progressivism. The settlement movement, in particular, has generated a lively debate. Some
                    historians claim that settlement workers were "spearheads for reform" dedicated to
                    a vision of progressive change. Others insist that middle-class settlement workers tried to control
                    the behavior and attitudes of their working-class clientele. In <hi rend="i">Social Work and Social
                        Order</hi> Ruth Hutchinson Crocker argues that settlement workers in Indiana did both. They

                    service programs for immigrants, African Americans, and white working-class men and women. In the
                    process they also hoped to maintain social order. Settlement workers assisted foreigners in their
                    adjustment to American society but at the same time sought "to eradicate
                    foreignness" (p. 225). Protestant settlements showed little respect for the religious and
                    cultural heritage of immigrants while Catholic settlements tried "to neutralize the
                    proselytizing efforts of the Protestant agencies" (p. 212). Settlement workers also tried
                    to ease the transition of African-American migrants to the northern cities. Yet they were careful to
                    maintain the racial status quo through segregated services. Similarly, settlements catering to women
                    challenged neither traditional concepts of femininity nor women's proper place in society.
                    Instead, the settlement workers' "vision of reform rested on a greatly enhanced
                    role for motherhood, <pb n="151" id="VAA4025-089-2-059"/> rather than on equality or individualism,
                    on mothers' duties, not women's rights" (p. 217). Company sponsored
                    settlements served the needs of the working poor but also helped to adapt them to industrial society
                    in order to enhance their efficiency in the work force and to prevent challenges to the political
                    and economic system.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Social Work and Social Order</hi> is a valuable addition to the existing literature on
                    progressive reform. Crocker's study offers a new interpretive paradigm and important
                    insights into what she calls the "second-tier" settlements that worked in the
                    shadow of Hull House. Drawing on a variety of primary sources such as letters, newspaper accounts,
                    and settlement reports, Crocker creates a vivid portrait of settlement work in Indiana. This
                    well-written book will be of particular interest to labor, social, immigration, and progressive era
                    historians as well as students of welfare reform, social work, and Indiana history.</p>

            <p>The Crane naval weapons depot, located in Martin County in southwestern Indiana, was one of several
                    war production facilities that were built in Indiana during World War II. (The others included a

                    institution's half century of history. Chapters one and two deal with the social-economic
                    life of Martin County prior to the establishment of the Crane naval weapons depot. Chapter three
                    concerns the depot's construction, its wartime role, and its social history during the
                    World War II years. While covering the subject from 1945 through 1990, chapter four describes and
                    explains how the depot became a center providing technological support for modern weaponry.</p>
            <p>The authors hold that a "symbiotic" relationship existed between the Crane facility
                    and its neighbors during its first fifty years. In short, the institution provided jobs in an area
                    where employment was traditionally scarce while the people of southwestern Indiana supplied an
                    efficient and dedicated work force. As their <pb n="[152]" id="VAA4025-089-2-060"/>

                    The account of Crane history since World War II is uncritical.</p>
            <p>The book contains interesting primary source material and illustrations. Each chapter offers a
                    selection of memoirs of persons associated with the depot or the center. The
                    "Memories" sections do not provide introductory comments placing the reminiscences

            <p>In 1850 Germans accounted for over half of the foreign-born population in Indiana. Since <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>

                    </placeName>-American texts for the general reader fits in well with the Indiana Historical
                    Society's current Ethnic History Project. The 337 texts, mainly short narratives, were
                    assembled from oral interviews, written accounts of around seventy contributors, and printed
                    sources, including <placeName>

                    </placeName>- and English-language newspapers and local and family histories. The source of each
                    item is identified in brief endnotes to the collection. Most of the texts are in English, though
                    some are reported in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>

            <p>In his introductory note to the reader, Eberhard Reichmann points out that "the criteria for
                    inclusion of texts were fairly logical: There had to be a Hoosier <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName>-American connection in <pb n="154" id="VAA4025-089-2-062"/> the plot, the character
                    and/or the narrator. Items had to reflect—and with a certain charm or
                    punch—how life was experienced and perceived … It stands to reason that many
                    items, especially those dealing with language, are closely tied to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName>-American experience; others, less parochial, are simply all-Hoosier, all-American,
                    all-human" (p. vii). It is true that many of these texts are shared by other ethnic groups
                    throughout the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, but as they are presented here, most have a Hoosier <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> flavor.</p>
            <p>Arranged under twenty-seven headings, the selections include, among other things, tales of coming to
                    Indiana, of place and personal naming, of pioneer preachers and priests, of witches and the devil,
                    of other folk beliefs and customs, of children and school days, of Civil War days, and of accidents
                    and tragedies, including "The <placeName>

                    </placeName>-American Tragedy: World War I." Along with the folk's own account of
                    their experiences in arriving and living in Indiana, there is rich humor in these tales. For
                    example, readers learn that one "philosopher" used to say that "his was
                    the kind of luck that when soup was served, all he had was a fork" (p. 230) and that <placeName>

                    </placeName> funeral home after attending services for one of his few remaining friends. When asked
                    if he were feeling well, Vonnegut replied, "Oh, yes, I was just wondering whether
                    it's worth the trouble to go home or not" (p. 236). Readers also learn that an

                    requested drinks before that time, he looked at his pocket watch and observed that "it iz

            <p>With a too brief general introduction and without headnotes to the sections and texts, the editor
                    allows the texts to speak for themselves. While it is not necessary to tax theory in a collection of
                    texts intended for the general reader, brief historical and comparative headnotes to the sections
                    and/or texts would have made the collection more meaningful and useful.</p>

            <p>Eliza Julia (Andrews) Flower is perhaps known best as the probable agent of the estrangement between
                    George Flower and <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-089-2-063"/> Morris Birkbeck, founders of the English
                    Settlement in Edwards County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. In this volume she emerges much further, as an articulate early example of the
                    stereotypical indomitable Englishwoman surmounting privation at the edge of European civilization.
                    Her husband George Flower, on the other hand, comes forth in a less positive fashion.</p>
            <p>Most histories of the English Settlement essentially end with the death of Birkbeck in 1825, but this
                    book effectively begins some years later. Not really a volume of letters, it is instead a rendering
                    of Flower family history set against the larger development of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>-Indiana border. The first six chapters use letters from Eliza to a nephew as texts on
                    the basis of which information is spun out on such matters as education, commercial development,
                    domestic life and gender status, and health on the frontier. The seventh and final chapter, more
                    family-oriented, is mainly an account of the last years of this devoted couple, who died on the same
                    day in early 1862.</p>
            <p>Eliza had to put up with George Flower's personal and financial involvement with Fanny
                    Wright at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashoba</settlement>
                    </placeName>, though the authors point out that Celia Eckhardt's recent allegation of a
                    romance between the two is unprovable. Eliza also had to watch the Flowers’ considerable
                    fortune dwindle, not only as a result of George's altruism but also because of his
                    ill-regulated generosity to relatives and his improvidence and because of plain bad luck and bad
                    management. At one time the Flowers resided in Park House near Albion, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, one of the most impressive houses in the West, but at the end of their lives they were
                    reduced to hotel-keeping at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana.</p>
            <p>Eliza Flower gave birth to fourteen children and raised eight to adulthood, one of whom was murdered
                    by Illinois ruffians. She made a home for immigrant English relatives and presided over Park House,
                    entertaining its frequent guests. All the while she maintained a lively interest in her community
                    and in the larger world. Complaining was not in her nature; she seems seldom to have regretted her
                    relocation in fronter <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, asserting in 1833 that she liked the backwoods better than any place on earth.</p>
            <p>The authors' epistolary selections and accompanying prose provide the next best thing to a
                    full biography of Eliza Julia Flower. Liberal illustrations add further to this volume, including
                    three contemporary drawings of English Settlement scenes by Charles Alexandre LeSueur. While one
                    would wish for still more, this new light on the later years of the English Settlement and its
                    founders is welcome indeed.</p>

            <p>When I told a friend that I was reviewing a book about John Jacob Astor, she said, "Oh, one
                    of the robber barons!"—an opinion that Americans generally hold. A reader of
                    this book will modify that opinion. Astor had a streak of ruthlessness, to be sure, and he seldom
                    acted from altruistic motives, but as John Denis Haeger's research amply proves, the
                    wide-open economic opportunities of early nineteenth-century America and Astor's
                    exceptional entrepreneurial abilities were the principal sources of his success.</p>
            <p>Hardly the "rag to riches" tycoon of his earlier biographers, Astor was born into
                    the artisan class of a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> village near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Heidelberg</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1763. He attended the local school and at sixteen joined his older brother, a maker
                    of musical instruments, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>. As an agent of that brother and other British merchants, he arrived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the spring of 1784. By the end of that year he had established himself in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> as an importer of musical instruments and an exporter of furs. Soon he was assuring his
                    source of supply by investing in the western fur trade. After 1800 he entered the <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> trade, sending his ships to the Orient with furs and sandalwood and bringing teas and
                    silks to European and American markets.</p>
            <p>In 1808 Astor founded the American Fur Company and in 1811 sent two expeditions to the Pacific
                    Northwest, one around Cape Horn, the other overland, with the purpose of building a fort and trading
                    post on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> River. This was the ill-fated settlement at Astoria. According to Haeger,
                    Astor's "career during the War of 1812 was a clear example of the intimate
                    relationships among politicians and businessmen in the early Republic" (p. 138). Astor
                    purchased government loans but also traded with the enemy. He kept up friendly contact with
                    government officials but pursued his business interests with single-minded purpose. In 1813 he lost
                    Astoria to the Canadians, not because its conception was economically unsound but because
                    "timing and luck were not his allies" (p. 167).</p>
            <p>After the war Astor was one of the backers of the Second Bank of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and he served briefly as director of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> branch. He revived the American Fur Company, came to dominate the trade at
                    Michilimackinac and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and continued to send his ships all over the world. From 1819 to the middle 1830s he
                    spent much of his time in Europe. Through trusted lieutenants, he retained the overall management of
                    his business affairs in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. While the American Fur Company grew larger than any of its competitors, it never
                    became a monopoly. Astor sold his <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-089-2-065"/> interest in it in 1834.
                    Subsequently, he devoted himself to real estate investment and urban development. He became <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s largest landlord—at one point he had 450 tenants—and,
                    with his son, he built the famous Astor House hotel. When he died in 1848 his estate was worth eight
                    to ten million dollars, a very large fortune for that day.</p>
            <p>"Astor's career," Haeger sums up, "was remarkable for its
                    modernity, vision, and reflection of American economic and political values" (pp.

                    </placeName> in northwestern Virginia in 1849, the first west of the Allegheny Mountains, became an
                    engineering marvel of the day and a promising east-west connection of both the National Road and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Ohio Railroad. The height of the span did not allow passage of some steamboats with
                    very tall chimneys, and residents of nearby <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> complained that the structure was an obstacle to upper river traffic. In fact, there
                    were instances where boats did strike the bridge. Litigation between Pennsylvania and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, the two states involved in this dispute, went to the Supreme Court where competition
                    between growing western cities and between types of internal improvements (railroads and steamboats)
                    led to a new constitutional question.</p>
            <p>In 1852 the court held that the bridge was indeed an interference with interstate commerce and must
                    be altered or removed. It was an issue of federalism, of national and state powers. Forthwith,
                    Congress, until then silent on standards of bridge construction, responded to political pressures to
                    override the judicial ruling by declaring the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wheeling</settlement>
                    </placeName> bridge an essential postal and military road. The issue called into question which
                    branch of government, the court or Congress, had the greater authority to interpret the
                    Constitution. When that problem came to the justices in 1855, they answered that it was Congress, at
                    least in this instance.</p>
            <p>The interplay of politics and economic development is thoroughly researched and explained. Elizabeth
                    Brand Monroe draws upon a great many primary materials (government documents, <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-089-2-066"/> manuscripts, newspapers) as well as the relevant historical literature.
                    She seems on sure ground in revising the familiar thesis of Willard Hurst on law stimulating
                    economic growth. As she points out, different parts of the economy had conflicting interests; and
                    therefore the legal system often favored one at the expense of another. Though she also has
                    worthwhile observations on the constitutional competition of judicial and legislative branches, the
                    long-range distribution of the commerce power between them receives less emphasis.</p>

                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName>, and Callaway. These counties earned the sobriquet of "Little Dixie"
                    for their fealty to the Democratic party and by the concentration of slave labor found there.</p>
            <p>Farmers who began arriving in Little Dixie after the War of 1812 remained subsistence producers up to
                    the 1820s because of a scarcity of markets rather than from lack of desire. These settlers also
                    suffered from contentious land sales stemming from Spanish titles in the old Louisiana territory and
                    from the economic depression following the Panic of 1819. Still, with the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> "fever" running high, Little Dixie did not lack for immigrants by the
                    mid-1820s.</p>
            <p>A majority of the immigrants shared a heritage which disposed them toward southern crops and southern
                    labor systems. Migrants from the Upper South transplanted tobacco cultivation to their new home and
                    found rich Missouri soils far more productive than worn-out Upper South soils. The southern
                    economy's increased reliance on cotton made hemp cultivation, to produce rope and bagging
                    for cotton bales, a mainstay of Little Dixie agriculture. Missouri farmers also raised hogs, sheep,
                    cattle, and mules. Much of the livestock was sold on a local market, but Little Dixie farmers also
                    drove herds of animals to eastern and southern markets. Although quality control and prices remained
                    a problem throughout the antebellum era, these products tied Little Dixie to a larger market.</p>
            <p>While Missouri averaged a slave population of 10 percent of the total population by 1860, in Little
                    Dixie the percentages ran <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-089-2-067"/> from 22 percent to 37 percent. Little
                    Dixie farmers considered slavery essential to the profitability of commercial agriculture. Hurt
                    documents the concern of Missouri slaveholders with abolitionism and the fate of Kansas Territory as
                    well as the day-to-day problems of policing, feeding, clothing, and providing medical care for a
                    slave population. Hurt interprets Little Dixie's support for John Bell, Constitutional
                    Union party presidential candidate in 1860, as evidence of the region's devotion to a
                    moderate solution to the sectional issue.</p>
            <p>Perhaps unintentionally, Hurt inserts himself into the quarrel over the timing and extent to which
                    frontier farmers moved from self-sufficiency to involvement in the market economy by repeatedly
                    asserting that Missouri farmers wanted, from the very beginning, to produce their crops for market.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Half Slave and Half Free: The Roots of the Civil War</hi>. By Bruce Levine. (<placeName>

                    </placeName>: Hill and Wang, 1992. Pp. x, 292. Bibliographical essay, index. $30.00.)</head>
            <p>Bruce Levine describes his new book on the coming of the Civil War as a "resynthesis of
                    social and political history" (p. vii). It attempts to integrate newer works in social and
                    cultural history into a wide-ranging reconsideration of how sectional and intrasectional differences
                    led to what the author calls the "second act of America's democratic
                    revolution" (p. 14). Despite a fairly sophisticated interpretative framework, Levine sees
                    slavery as fundamental to the complex political, economic, social, and cultural conflicts of the
                    antebellum decades.</p>
            <p>As the book's title and much of the text suggests, the paradox between liberty and slavery
                    was a central theme of American history and a source of chronic and finally irreconcilable tensions.
                    Joining James Oakes and others in downplaying the importance of paternalism, Levine views slavery as
                    a mechanism for labor exploitation. Indeed, an interest in labor systems—and in the
                    history of workers—is a powerful thread running through the book and one that
                    distinguishes it from other works on this topic.</p>
            <p>New material on religious, social, and cultural life in the North and South, however, is not
                    especially well integrated with the more conventional descriptions of sectional politics. Moreover,
                    Levine sometimes exaggerates the degree of sectional distinctive-ness. For instance, he
                    underestimates the influence of evangelical religion on more traditional notions of honor in the
                    South and is too quick to accept some provocative but at times misleading generalizations found in a
                    number of secondary works. To be fair, how <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-089-2-068"/> ever, by painting a
                    picture of sectional conflict with such broad strokes, the author is also able to make some telling
                    points, especially about the tangled meanings of liberty for various groups and individuals.</p>
            <p>On more conventional topics such as the territorial question, the breakdown of the second American
                    party system, and the politics of slavery of the 1850s, Levine is often sketchy, episodic, and
                    predictable. An exception is his skillful analysis of nativism and, curiously enough, his basic
                    rejection of ethnocultural explanations for political behavior in the two decades before the Civil
                    War. Again, he is especially good at examining reactions of northern working people to the political
                    upheaval of the era.</p>
            <p>As a new synthetic treatment of the "roots of the Civil War," <hi rend="i">Half
                        Slave and Half Free</hi> adds a few new twists to a familiar story. The attempt to bring
                    cultural and social themes into the analysis is ambitious and laudatory but not entirely successful.
                    Useful for both general readers and undergraduates, especially for introducing important ideas from
                    the most recent scholarship, Levine's book in many ways reflects both the strengths and
                    weaknesses of contemporary erudition.</p>

            <p>Civil War buffs and historians need little introduction to General Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. His

                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>

                    officially commanded more than a brigade, Chamberlain has since overshadowed many of his superior
                    officers who commanded divisions and corps. His figure has graced the pages of numerous histories of

                        </placeName>
               </hi>, by the late Indiana author Alice Rains Trulock, is, quite simply, the
                    definitive biography of the modest professor-turned-soldier. Writing with a poetic prose that is
                    reminiscent of Bruce Catton, Trulock recounts Chamberlain's life in microscopic detail,
                    from childhood through his four postwar <pb n="161" id="VAA4025-089-2-069"/> terms as governor of

                    </placeName>. Trulock details how Chamberlain's character was shaped, in part, by his
                    demanding father, who taught him perseverance; and how it was tempered in the forge of battle,
                    which, Chamberlain believed, was "a test of character; it makes bad men worse and good men
                    better" (p. 340).</p>
            <p>Chamberlain's Civil War service, of course, is the heart of the book. Trulock's
                    knowledge of the Civil War and deep understanding of Chamberlain is evident as she follows her
                    subject through the travail of battle. Her description of Chamberlain at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>

            <p>It is unfortunate that Civil War enthusiasts will hear no more from Alice Rains Trulock, as she died

            <p>Anyone who has been exposed to the arcane world of Custer literature can attest to the fact that the
                    mix of sense and nonsense, truth and fancy that comprise that literature is heady and addictive.
                    Hutton has assembled in 585 pages all the information one needs to know about Custer, his times, and
                    his battle. Once those pages have been read, the reader knows all any sensible person <pb n="162" id="VAA4025-089-2-070"/> needs to know on the matter. But if at that point the reader's
                    senses fail, Hutton conveniently includes a list of the ten best books for those who want or need
                    more (it really is only nine because <hi rend="i">The Custer Reader</hi> is included as one of the

               <hi rend="i">The Shaker Experience in America: A History of the United Society of Believers</hi>.
                    By Stephen J. Stein. (<placeName>

                    suggestions for further reading, index. $40.00.)</head>
            <p>This big, gracefully written book comes close to being a definitive history of Shakerism, without
                    entirely supplanting earlier books on the subject like Edward Deming Andrews's classic, <hi rend="i">The People Called Shakers</hi> (1953). Stephen J. Stein presents a carefully detailed
                    portrait to demonstrate that the popular image of the Shakers as quaintly innocent chair makers is
                    simplistic: a photograph features a group of twentieth-century Shakers seated in their new
                    possession, a large automobile. He depicts a people who, while creating their own distinctive
                    communal world, also related to American society in general.</p>
            <p>A scrupulous scholar, Stein bases his discussion of the formative years of Shakerism exclusively on
                    the relatively small number of available contemporary sources in order to separate the truth from
                    the myths established by later accounts. One result is to diminish Ann Lee's importance as
                    a founder and to enhance that of James Whittaker. This is the shortest of the book's five
                    parts, the others benefitting from the fact that the Shakers, initially suspicious of the written
                    word, eventually created an extensive documentary record.</p>
            <p>Part II gives special emphasis to the development of Shaker communitarianism and theology and to the
                    westward expansion of the evolving order, the central figure being Lucy Wright who consolidated the
                    influence of women within the movement. A notable exception to this success was the closing in 1826
                    of the West Union community in Indiana as a result of poor health conditions and the desertion of
                    many of its young members. Part III presents Shakerism at its apogee between 1827 and 1875, a time
                    of prosperity agitated both by spiritualism and conflict within the order. The next part, relating
                    to the years after 1875, is chiefly a story of decline marked by the feminization of the society as
                    male membership dwindled. This period also contained elements of dynamic change as Shakers responded
                    to a modernizing world. Part V features the <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-089-2-071"/> revival of interest
                    in Shakerism after the 1960s that temporarily saved the last two communities at

            <p>In this rich offering of insights, there are a few flaws: Stein sometimes makes assertions which he
                    does not adequately document, and he is rather weak in his picture of social and economic life
                    within the society. On the whole, however, he has written an interesting work which establishes a
                    new standard of truth and completeness in Shaker scholarship. Yale University Press should be
                    commended for producing a book as handsome as it is scholarly.</p>

                    $32.50.)</head>
            <p>The thesis of Shawn Lay and the contributors to <hi rend="i">The Invisible Empire in the West</hi> is
                    that the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s has been misunderstood. Using the case study method, the authors
                    examine the Klan in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>
                    </placeName>, El Paso, Anaheim, Salt Lake City, and Eugene, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName>. It makes sense to study the Klan in a decentralized manner because the organization
                    was decentralized and fragmented, changing color like a chameleon to meld with the local
                    environment.</p>
            <p>Lay believes previous writers have exaggerated the violence of the Klan and that sensationalized
                    accounts are simplistic. The Klan was not composed of marginal men animated by status anxiety and
                    was not dominated by fundamentalists, and there was surprising diversity within its ranks. Never a
                    monolithic movement, it attracted idealists and reformers as well as bigots. Indeed, Klansmen were
                    no more bigoted than non-Klansmen; they were simply activists. Puncturing stereotypes, the authors
                    point out that the Klan was populistic and advocated improved law enforcement, better education, and
                    municipal reform. Its objective was to enforce prohibition and uphold the moral status quo. Klansmen
                    disliked chaos, relished order, and considered themselves patriotic. They were average citizens, not
                    social deviants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Invisible Empire in the West</hi> applies a higher level of sophistication to the
                    Klan than previous studies. In an illuminating introduction followed by a historiographical essay,
                    the editor argues that older interpretations of the 1920s Klan were flawed by prejudice,
                    overgeneralizations, and a paucity of primary research. <pb n="164" id="VAA4025-089-2-072"/> The
                    authors do not consider the Klan an irrational response to modernization; rather, it was a quite
                    understandable, if simplistic, response. Klansmen were hardly as innocent as Boy Scouts, and many
                    were intolerant and narrow-minded; but interpretations that describe the Klan as a fringe movement
                    reflect the biases of historians rather than the realities of the 1920s Klan.</p>
            <p>Lay's book is well conceived, thoroughly researched, and eloquently written. Indiana readers
                    will find it of particular interest because the Klan reached its apogee in the Hoosier State. The
                    interpretation of the contributors is not altogether new, nor is it certain that the conclusions
                    about the Klan in the West, which produced only 7 percent of Klan members, apply to the entire
                    nation. Nonetheless, <hi rend="i">The Invisible Empire in the West</hi> is a valuable corrective
                    grounded in substantial primary research that provides new facts as well as a more realistic
                    interpretation. The fact that the Klan was relatively mainstream makes it all the more disturbing;
                    it would have been less dangerous if it had been an aberration.</p>

                    By Barbara Melosh. (<placeName>

                    notes, index. Clothbound, $60.00; paper-bound, $24.95.)</head>
            <p>The fact that Barbara Melosh announces in the introduction to this work that her purpose is to
                    "investigate gender representations in New Deal culture through a study of the paintings,
                    sculptures, and plays produced under two New Deal-sponsored programs, the Treasury Section of Fine
                    Arts and the Federal Theatre Project" (p. 5) indicates scholars finally have reached a
                    sophisticated level of scholarship about the 1930s. Marlene Park and Gerald E. Markowitz's
                        <hi rend="i">Democratic Vistas: Post Office and Public Art in the New Deal</hi> (1984) provided
                    a useful overview of the most widespread public art program in American history. Since that time, a
                    few other works on the murals have appeared with a regional orientation. Now, Melosh surveys the
                    murals along with plays produced by the Federal Theater to argue "for critical theory
                    grounded in historical evidence" (p. 8) while examining New Deal culture "as a
                    source that illuminates both feminism's decline and liberal reform" (p. 3).</p>
            <p>Melosh locates her discussion somewhere between "postmodernists"—a term
                    she uses rather than "poststructuralist" because she wants to include
                    "cultural developments outside the realm of literary criticism" (p.
                    9)—and "materialists," with just a bit of a <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-089-2-073"/> kind of "reader-response" theory added, although here
                    it might be better called "viewer-response" to indicate the postal patrons who saw
                    the murals and the theater audiences who witnessed the plays. To develop her argument, Melosh posits
                    an indicator against which the art works and plays will be gauged: "the ideal of sexual
                    complementarity that dominates New Deal-sponsored renditions of pioneers and agrarians. The
                    comradely ideal, as I have called it, touted women's contributions even as it finessed
                    difficult questions of sexual equality" (p. 11).</p>
            <p>If a single overwhelming goal for this work can be suggested, it is the pursuit of "the
                    comradely ideal" in the murals, the plays, and, perhaps most importantly, in the day-to-day
                    interchanges between the artists and the administrators of the Section of Fine Arts. Unfortunately,
                    records comparable to the boxes of letters, forms, newsletters, and other miscellany from the
                    section do not exist for the Federal Theatre Project. Consequently Melosh must base much of her
                    theatrical comments on contemporary reviews, occasional production notes, and a scattering of
                    letters from directors about particular nuances given to a particular production. This is not to say
                    that the commentary about the Federal Theatre Project is less valid, but more is said about the
                    murals than about the plays.</p>
            <p>In her most important chapter, "Women, Art, and Ideology," Melosh develops a useful
                    assessment of the place and role of the woman artist in the artistic and administrative milieu of
                    the 1930s in order to "examine representations of womanhood as they were constructed and
                    negotiated by artists, Section administrators, and a diverse public [and] consider women's
                    relationship to what I call an aesthetic of containment, investigating female artist's uses
                    of the prevailing vocabularies of gender" (p. 204). Unfortunately, the assessment is not a
                    happy one. Although the section was more open to works of women artists and would not accept many
                    traditional formats, such as allegorical female nudes, the women artists "left few traces
                    of a recognizably female vision, instead registering the differences of sex only by their selective
                    use of a tradition defined by male artists, critics, and spectators", (p. 220).</p>

            <p>The personal physicians of presidents have often given their patients poor care and have not been
                    loath to tell the public outright lies about the state of presidential health. These are the key
                    conclusions of Robert H. Ferrell in this fascinating book.</p>
            <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-089-2-074"/>
            <p>Eight case histories provide Ferrell with his evidence. Brief accounts, less than ten pages each, are
                    given of the health problems of Grover <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush.
                    Twenty-one pages are devoted to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Roosevelt's illnesses. The most detailed and freshest account, nearly a
                    hundred pages, chronicles Dwight Eisenhower's heart attacks, stroke, and Crohn's
                    disease.</p>
            <p>Besides using the considerable published literature on the theme of presidential health, Ferrell has
                    explored many manuscript collections and conducted numerous interviews. His writing has a crisp
                    explicitness and a forthrightness in making judgments. He suggests that, on health grounds, Wilson
                    should not have been nominated in 1912, nor Harding in 1920, nor Roosevelt for a fourth term, nor
                    Eisenhower for a second. He makes clear that, prior to Kennedy's running for the
                    presidency, his Addison's disease and back problems were much greater handicaps than
                    publicly acknowledged. Calculated cover-ups kept citizens deceived as to the gravity of
                    Kennedy's medical problems and those of many other presidents. Improper treatment,
                    according to the best medical standards of the day, frequently occurred because presidential
                    physicians were long-standing personal friends rather than the nation's best qualified
                    practitioners. When specialists were called in, their advice was sometimes modified because of
                    political concerns. Kennedy for a time was treated by a dispenser of amphetamine "pep
                    pills" whom one of his own nurses termed "absolutely a quack" (p. 157).</p>
            <p>Indiana comes into Ferrell's account through two vice-presidents who might have stepped up
                    had health problems forced presidents to step down. Former Indiana governor Thomas Marshall, after
                    Wilson's debilitating stroke, inquired each morning as to the president's health
                    but did not see him again until the day Wilson turned over the reins of government to Harding. The
                    question of Bush's health did not become so great an issue in the 1992 election as
                    predicted on <hi rend="i">

                    Quayle's competence to assume the presidency might have received more emphasis during the
                    campaign.</p>
            <p>Ferrell deplores the lack of candor, the deliberate deception, about presidential health through the
                    decades, as he regrets the frequent mismanagement of presidential therapy. He endorses a suggestion

               <hi rend="i">Editor's note: Because of the importance of genealogy to Indiana's
                        history the editors of the</hi> Indiana Magazine of History <hi rend="i">invited three experts
                        to review this book. We are grateful to Thomas Hamm, John D. Beatty, and Susan Miller Carter for
                        their contributions</hi>.</p>
            <p>Genealogy is, by some estimates, now the third most popular hobby in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. It is also one that has particular connections with history. At their best,
                    genealogists work with the same kinds of records and wrestle with the same questions of proof and
                    verification as do historians. Many archives and research libraries find that genealogists are by
                    far their largest group of patrons; many historical societies are made up mostly of people pursuing
                    family history. (Well over half of the Indiana Historical Society's members indicate an
                    interest in genealogy.) Some historians, however, view genealogists with scarcely disguised distrust
                    and dismay; "genie" stories are a staple of archival conferences. For that reason,
                    it is encouraging to see a respected academic publisher such as Indiana University Press issue such
                    a book.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this work has major problems. There is a real need for a specialized guide that will
                    lead genealogists through the intricacies and peculiarities of working with Indiana records. Mona
                    Robinson's book does some of these things. But it contains so many errors both of omission
                    and commission that its value is suspect.</p>
            <p>First of all, this book desperately needed a thorough reading by a knowledgeable <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> historian. There are just too many mistakes. Ohio is not listed among the states formed
                    out of the Northwest Territory. The Treaty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> ending the Revolutionary War came in 1783, not 1787. Arthur St. Clair was governor of
                    the Northwest Territory, not the Ohio Territory, in 1792, and St. Marys is in northwestern, not
                    northeastern, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Interstate 65 only remotely parallels the Michigan Road. There are far too many
                    others.</p>
            <p>More serious are the errors that will lead genealogists astray. The County Records of Indiana
                    Microfilming Project (CRIMP) did not end in 1990. The 1807 territorial census does not include the
                    number of people in each household. The 1850 census does not include parents' birthplaces.
                    The 1860 Indiana census, in the opinion of everyone I consulted, is not "notoriously
                    difficult" to read (p. 137). On page 139, Robinson says that Indiana birth records do not
                    begin until 1907, even though on page 124 she has correctly stated that they begin in 1882. Reading
                    page 125 would make one think that there are no death records in county health departments after
                    1899, when in fact they are there. Although the Genealogy <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-089-2-076"/>
                    Division of the Indiana State Library has an excellent collection of census microfilm, it is not
                    complete for every state through 1920. A call to the Division of Vital Records of the Indiana State
                    Board of Health brought assurances that their marriage records begin in 1958, while Robinson says
                    that they go back to 1882.</p>
            <p>Perhaps most disappointing is what the work does not mention, things peculiar to Indiana that one
                    would not find in general genealogical "how to" manuals. The discussion of county
                    histories on pages 152–55 is good, but there is no mention of the wonderful every-name
                    indexes of Indiana county histories begun by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s
                    and completed in the 1980s by the Indiana Historical Society and the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen County</region>
                    </placeName> Public Library. Even more disturbing is the omission of the indexes of birth, death,
                    and marriage records up to 1920 for most Indiana counties done by the WPA, a basic starting point
                    for most Hoosier genealogists. Another disservice to readers is the lack of any mention of the
                    excellent 1860 census index done by the Indiana Historical Society. Then there is
                    Robinson's discussion of probate records, which is good as far as it goes, but ignores one
                    of Indiana's nineteenth-century peculiarities. By law, county clerks kept two sets of
                    probate books—order books, which provide a bare-bones outline of actions relating to an
                    estate, and complete records, which contain transcripts of every document relating to an estate,
                    compiled at the time of settlement. The latter are often more accessible and more easily used than
                    the original files of estate papers. Yet Robinson says nothing about them.</p>
            <p>This book is not all bad. The section on cemeteries and reading tombstones is first-rate. Also
                    welcome is the author's insistence on careful note taking and citation of sources. This
                    reviewer hopes, however, that Robinson will reconsider her emphasis on photocopying—the
                    last thing that many increasingly fragile courthouse and library volumes need is that stress. This
                    is not "genealogy for beginners", however. I recommend the book only to the most
                    experienced genealogists who will be able to separate the useful from the erroneous and misleading.</p>

            <p>Ever since the booming interest in genealogy began in the mid-1970s, a need has existed for a
                    comprehensive guidebook for the novice wishing to begin research in Indiana. Mona
                    Robinson's <hi rend="i">Who's Your Hoosier Ancestor</hi> represents the latest and
                    possibly most lengthy effort to date in the quest of this objective.</p>
            <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-089-2-077"/>
            <p>Robinson divides her book into two parts. She devotes the first section to a brief but necessary
                    historical overview of the state, framed to the interests of the genealogist. She discusses
                    historical topography and boundaries, Native Americans, early settlement patterns and ethnic groups,
                    providing important background information and adding a section of notes for further reading. In one
                    chapter on emigrant trails, she lists the major roads that existed during Indiana's
                    formative years, who used them, and how they affected the state's settlement and growth.
                    The novice and experienced alike can benefit from the clues provided about possible ancestral
                    origins and migration routes.</p>
            <p>The second part of Robinson's book focuses on specific sources for genealogical research.
                    Included are chapters on military, church, cemetery, county, and census records, as well as a
                    section on secondary county histories. In a readable, straightforward style, Robinson illustrates
                    the genealogical value of each record type while warning of its limitations. For example, her
                    section on cemetery research, arguably the best in the book, includes practical advice on how to
                    decipher tombstone inscriptions, how to locate cemeteries, how to look for evidence of possible
                    relationships based on tombstone arrangements, and what type of apparel to wear when doing field
                    work. Robinson cautions the novice correctly that carved information is sometimes wrong and should
                    be verified, when possible, from other sources.</p>
            <p>But where Robinson succeeds with her explanations, she sometimes stumbles by failing to mention a
                    crucial resource for a particular record group. In explaining the value of county histories, she
                    misleads the reader when she writes that these sources "are indexed only by broad
                    classifications" and that it can be "time consuming to locate an individual in an
                    unindexed volume" (p. 155). She seems unaware of the <hi rend="i">Indexes of Persons and
                        Firms</hi>, which provide every-name access to most of Indiana's county histories, as
                    well as the <hi rend="i">Indiana Biographical Index</hi>, a similar though distinct index on
                    microfiche. Both of these are basic sources for the beginner, and their omission remains a serious
                    flaw.</p>
            <p>Several other sections are also bereft of references to key sources. In discussing vital records,
                    Robinson makes no mention of the typescript indexes by the Works Project Administration available in
                    most genealogical libraries. In her section on wills, she fails to mention the nine-volume <hi rend="i">Indiana Wills Index through 1880</hi>, a basic starting-point in doing probate
                    research. She ignores the vast amount of periodical literature for the state, the valuable records
                    often published there, and the <hi rend="i">Periodical Source Index (PERSI</hi>) that provides
                    genealogical access to most of it. Her section on church records contains no reference to L. C.
                    Rudolph and Judith Endelman's <hi rend="i">Religion in Indiana</hi> (1986), the most
                    authoritative guide to the state's religious archives.</p>
            <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-089-2-078"/>
            <p>In spite of these problems, much of Robinson's approach is worthy of commendation, She
                    offers well-written discussions of those research methodologies essential for every novice to learn
                    before beginning research. Her expertise is clearly in the area of primary, rather than secondary
                    sources. Her book could have been made better had the publisher consulted other genealogists about
                    the sources used and omitted and then made the necessary additions before going to press.</p>

            <p>The publication of <hi rend="i">Who's Your Hoosier Ancestor? Genealogy for Beginners</hi>
                    holds great promise. Those who have Hoosier ancestors or who help others find forebears with Hoosier
                    roots would appreciate a comprehensive, up-to-date, and factual volume to guide the search. Because
                    the book is published by scholarly Indiana University Press, expectations are high.</p>
            <p>Although the book has weaknesses, author Mona Robinson succeeds overall in meeting her goal
                    "to present the means and methods for locating elusive ancestors who once lived in
                    Indiana" (page ix). Robinson, genealogical researcher and newspaper genealogy columnist,
                    has produced a serviceable guide. She covers a broad array of topics that concern beginning
                    researchers.</p>
            <p>The first five chapters are packed with information on geography, Indians, boundaries, emigrant
                    trails, and immigrants. One cannot successfully isolate family history research from a general
                    historical survey. It is historical background that gives the researcher a basis upon which to
                    conduct genealogical inquiry. Chapters six through nine treat topics typically associated with
                    genealogical research: military, church and cemetery, county, and census records. In addition to a
                    discussion of the availability of records, the author also includes useful ideas on the genealogical
                    value of various record types and a summary of potential problems with their use.</p>
            <p>The chapter on military records draws on information from Carolynne L. Wendel Miller's <hi rend="i">Indiana Sources for Genealogical Research</hi> (1984). Unfortunately, Robinson confuses
                    the locations of records housed by several distinct entities in the State Library and Historical
                    Building: the library of the Indiana Historical Society, the Indiana State Archives, and the Indiana
                    State Library. The location and holdings of these agencies frequently perplex researchers, <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-089-2-079"/> but to have this confusion perpetuated in print is a blow both
                    to beginning genealogists and to the institutions involved.</p>
            <p>The last two chapters might have been even more helpful had they been located earlier in the book
                    since the topics they cover are so fundamental. They are "Indiana County Histories and
                    Other Sources" which includes libraries along with city directories, newspapers and
                    mortuaries, and "Basic Genealogical Principles." The tenth chapter treats
                    "other sources" and contains dated or incorrect material in the address list of
                    Indiana societies and libraries. A more carefully checked and updated list would have been a greater
                    service to researchers. Also, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) consolidated indexes to county
                    histories and the WPA indexes to births, marriages and deaths, indispensable tools for genealogy
                    research in libraries, are not mentioned specifically by name. This would have been a logical
                    inclusion, given the thorough treatment Robinson gives many other resources.</p>
            <p>Robinson concludes by sharing sensible suggestions with the novice. For example, she recommends
                    contacting research facilities in advance to arrange for a visit, an excellent idea for those on a
                    tight schedule. There is always a disparity between research to be done and time available.
                    Robinson's practical tips will repay the reader who heeds them.</p>
            <p>Taken as a whole, the effect of <hi rend="i">Who's Your Hoosier Ancestor?</hi> on genealogy
                    in Indiana should be positive. The beginning researcher who reads the book will gain a foundation
                    from which to work and will benefit from Robinson's years of work with family history. The
                    how-to tips and warnings about possible research and documentation pitfalls will serve beginners
                    well. Inclusion of incorrect or dated information and omission of valuable resources are
                    regrettable, however, since they will slow novice researchers and will compromise the
                    book's credibility.</p>

                    </placeName>, IN 46214.) There are few places in Indiana history where the features of continuity
                    and change are so vividly illustrated as in the Indiana State Fair. This book shows traditions and
                    changes in hogs, corn, farm implements, horse racing, crafts, food, entertainment, and socializing,
                    particularly by means of fascinating illustrations. Although the volume does not attempt the kind of
                    sustained historical analysis found in Karal Ann Marling's recent book on the Minnesota

                    excellent job of capturing the distinctiveness of people and place, from barbershops and basketball
                    to churches and cars. This volume builds on Whorrall's earlier <hi rend="i">Woven Hills
