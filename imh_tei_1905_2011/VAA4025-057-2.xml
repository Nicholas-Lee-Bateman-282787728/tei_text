            <p>It has been Daniel Pratt's fate to be one of the nearly forgotten senators from Indiana. He
                    served in Congress for only one term, 1869–1875, and no important piece of legislation is
                    connected with his name. He was a modest, rather self-effacing man who served in an arena where
                    modesty is seldom the rule. Active during a period of extreme political partisanship, he was a
                    moderate. In an age when the reputation of many politicians became spotted, his shone with luster.
                    His Senate colleague from Indiana was Oliver P. Morton, the Civil War governor, who had entered the
                    Senate in 1867 and whose prominence always overshadowed that of the Junior Senator from Indiana.
                    After completing his term in the Senate, Pratt became commissioner of internal revenue at the time
                    of the exposure of the Whiskey Ring. As did so many other good men connected with the Grant
                    administration, he resigned without completing his term, because the President insisted on
                    dismissing a courageous investigator of the Whiskey Frauds. Although Pratt lacked political flair
                    and brilliance, he was an able public servant, an arduous worker, and a politician of integrity.</p>
            <p>Pratt came to Indiana from the East as a young man. He was born in <placeName>

            <p>Pratt came to maturity during the decade of the 1830's when the Jacksonian westward
                    migration was at its height and the lure of the West strong. In 1832, with thirty dollars in his

               </placeName>, he
                    found his small savings so depleted that boat travel was no longer possible. Leaving his trunk to be
                    brought on by boat, he walked to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Pausing there for only a short time, he pushed along the <geogName>Ohio

            </p>
            <p>Teaching, however, did not appear to offer the opportunities that the ambitious young man desired;
                    law seemed to be a more alluring profession. George H. Dunn, prominent lawyer and politician of <placeName>

                    looked promising. As he wrote in 1834 to his friend, John H. Jones, "The country around
                    here is beautiful and fast filling up—and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                        refinement."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Calvin Fletcher, one of the leading lawyers in the
                    capital, permitted Pratt to study in his office, and from this association there developed a very
                    fine friendship. Their correspondence and visits continued until Fletcher's death in
                        1866.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The young law student also needed to maintain himself while studying.
                    Governor Noble employed him for a time as his private secretary and appointed him a quartermaster
                    general at a salary of fifty dollars per year. He also found part-time work with Secretary of State
                    William Sheets, who employed him as a clerk while the general assembly was in session.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite these jobs and his legal studies, Pratt did not neglect opportunities for gaining experience
                    and training as an orator. In his younger days, Pratt wrote out his speeches and memorized them. He
                    joined the newly-organized Athenaeum in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and among his papers is a copy of an address on "The Atmosphere,"
                    with the notation that it was read before members of that organization on February 24, 1835.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> There are also copies of several addresses on temperance, a reform in which

                    1830's was one of revived interest in slavery and intemperance; each received attention
                    from reformers. Pratt's law mentor, Calvin Fletcher, was greatly interested in both of
                    these movements, and Pratt was quite likely influenced by him.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>The militant antislavery movement, beginning in the decade of the 1830's, was probably too
                    extreme for Pratt's cautious, legalistic, and conservative outlook. Rather, the gradual
                    methods advocated by the American Colonization Society were more appealing to him. Another

                    support for the Indiana branch of the American Colonization Society. Using the well-known phrase of
                    the Declaration of Independence as a premise, Pratt asked his audience if the colored man was
                    recognized in Indiana as the equal of the white man. After sketching the disabilities under which
                    the free Negroes lived in the state, it was obvious that "while they live and work among
                    us, they are not of us." While Pratt had no hope that their condition would be better in
                    the foreseeable future, he urged greater public interest in the society's branch in the
                    state, which sorely needed some financial support. The state branch had been organized in 1829, but
                    after five years no more than $600 had been contributed by Hoosiers to the parent
                    society. Pratt expressed his belief that the society's program would not only aid the free
                    Negroes in America, but that <placeName>

                    </placeName> could serve as a base for "the redemption of Africa" from barbarism
                    and Islam. Therefore, he urged Hoosiers, as philanthropists and Christians, to contribute. Referring

                    to the areas occupied by Miami and Potawatomi Indian reservations also made it a lively trading
                    center. It was near their "Treaty Grounds," and, since considerable litigation
                    originated there, it was a place where there was need for lawyers. At that time <placeName>

            <p>One position which Pratt sought during his first year of legal practice was that of assistant clerk
                    of the lower house of the general assembly of 1836–1837. But as one of four aspirants
                    nominated for that position, Pratt lost to George P. R. Wilson.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> This was
                    apparently his first political contest. The policy of the federal government in removal of the
                    Indians gave Pratt another opportunity for a temporary position. Colonel Abel C. Pepper, the Indian
                    agent, was negotiating a treaty of removal with the tribes near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1838, and Pratt eagerly accepted a post as his assistant secretary. Pratt's
                    salary was four dollars per day, with an additional sum of eighty-five dollars for keeping the
                    accounts and distributing the gifts.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Many years later Pratt vividly recalled
                    this experience—the methods used in treaty negotiations, the transfer of lands, the
                    distribution of presents and money, and the drunken orgies of the Indians.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Pratt devoted all his energies to building up a law practice. Apparently, one of the reasons for the
                    fine practice he eventually developed was "the exclusive and exhaustive manner in which he
                    gave himself to his profession."<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Nonetheless, the first few years
                    were financially lean; Pratt later recalled that his earnings during the first year were from
                    $300 to $400.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> The Panic of 1837 and the ensuing

                    $100, the fee was 10 per cent; from $100 to $500, it was 6 per
                    cent; 5 per cent fee was charged for collections over $500. A fee of $1.50 was
                    to be charged for preparing a mortgage or executing power of attorney; $10 was the
                    established fee for filing a bill in chancery; and $15 was the charge for attending a
                    chancery suit.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

            <p>Pratt entered into a law partnership with William S. Palmer, but this partnership was dissolved in
                    1843, and evidently the two lawyers divided their business when they ended their association.
                    Several years after the dissolution, Palmer absconded with nearly $500 in debt
                    collections belonging to clients, some of whom had started with the firm of Pratt and Palmer. Pratt

            <p>As a young lawyer in a raw country, Pratt handled almost any practice that came his way. One of his
                    early cases concerned the Scott murder of 1838. Jeremiah H. Harrison, a shoemaker by trade, had
                    moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> from Rising Sun. In a night of brawling in a tavern, David Scott, a popular farmer of
                    the neighborhood, was stabbed, and Harrison was charged with the murder. Harrison was too poor to
                    employ legal counsel, and the court appointed Pratt and William Z. Stuart to defend him. The jury
                    found Harrison guilty of first-degree murder, and he was sentenced to be hanged. Evidently Pratt was
                    firmly convinced that the evidence of Harrison's guilt was not clear, for he made two trips
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> by horseback to seek reprieves from the governor. Since Scott had been a popular man in
                    the community, Pratt was hanged in effigy by some local residents for delaying the execution.
                    Harrison, however, committed suicide the night before he was to be hanged.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much of Pratt's business consisted of collection of debts, payment of notes, and transfer of

                    and G. W. Ewing, Indian traders, land speculators, and merchants, who had extensive land holdings in

            <p>By the decade of the 1850's Pratt's professional stature had grown to the place
                    where he was considered among the best lawyers in northern Indiana. This position was a result of
                    his integrity, the thorough way in which he prepared his cases, and his skill in pleading.
                    "He was of indefatigable industry…. When employed in time, he was never
                    surprised or defeated. He would explore every phase" of a case.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

                    </placeName> bar and later a judge of the state supreme court, is quoted as having said that Pratt
                    "`would develop more original views of law in a case that he studied, and maintain them
                    better and with more authorities'" than any other man he ever knew.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Pratt's closing argument before a jury was considered the strongest feature in
                    his conduct of a trial case. David Turpie wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>An argument to a jury, delivered upon the facts of the case in the close, was by him very

                            proportioned in his whole figure. His voice when raised to its full pitch and volume might
                            literally be well likened to the sound of many waters.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

            <p>A discussion of Pratt's legal career would not be complete without reference to the young
                    men who read law in his office. Pratt himself wrote: "I regard the most useful and

            <p>Pratt's rise to eminence in the legal profession was accompanied by ventures in politics.
                    The Whig party, generally regarded as the more conservative of the major parties of the time, was
                    the one with which Pratt affiliated. The men who probably influenced him the most at the beginning
                    of his residence in Indiana were National Republicans or Whigs. As already mentioned, Governor Noble
                    helped him in <placeName>

                    and Pinkney James, his father-in-law, were Whigs. With the congressional election of 1847
                    approaching, Pratt sought the Whig nomination for Congress from the Ninth District. His chief rival
                    was John B. Niles, but Pratt was chosen as the Whig candidate at the district convention at <placeName>

            <p>At this time the Mexican War was being fought, and the question of extension of slavery into
                    territory that might be acquired from Mexico was being debated. In the fifteen counties comprising
                    the Ninth Congressional District, which was located in northern Indiana, the population included
                    many settlers from the East. Free-Soilism had a greater number of sympathizers there than in the
                    southern section of the state. With most of them, the war was not popular.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> The
                    Democratic administration of President Polk was waging the war, and, as the opposition party, the
                    Whigs had to speak carefully on war issues. Pratt wrote to John D. Defrees, a Whig leader in the
                    state, for advice on the position he should take in his campaign. Defrees' reply was a
                    model of caution, astuteness, and political sagacity. He advised Pratt to uphold the
                    "no-annexation principle" as far as any Mexican territory was concerned but to
                    support the soldiers in the field as long as the war continued. The old Whig planks, advised
                    Defrees, should not be discussed at great length, although the subtreasury and tariff might be
                    mentioned, "occasionally and mildly."<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pratt's Democratic opponent was Charles W. Cathcart of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, who was seeking re-election. A former sailor, land surveyor, farmer, and member of the
                    state senate, Cathcart had served as a presidential elector in 1844 and had been elected to Congress
                    in 1845.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> As was customary at that time, the two candidates conducted a joint
                    canvass of their district from June 29 to July 31.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> The chief issue was a
                    national one—the support of the war, and particularly the question of voting supplies for
                    the American army fighting in Mexico. Cathcart stood on his record in supporting the war and
                    American troops. Pratt pledged his support to the army, but opposed the annexation of any possible
                    slave territory from Mexico.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Pratt went down to defeat in his first serious

            <p>Although Indiana went Democratic in the election, the national success of the Whig ticket and
                    Pratt's share in the canvass of 1848 placed him in a strong position for renomination for

                    Pratt now displayed an unfortunate flaw in political shrewdness—excessive caution,

                    advancement. Although his friends were certain that he again could have had the congressional

                    Graham Fitch, Pratt's friend, neighbor, and family physician, was nominated for Congress on
                    the Democratic ticket. Fitch had entered politics in 1836 as a candidate for the state legislature.

                    emerged as one of the leaders in the house. Appointed to serve on three standing

                    additional appropriations required by the protracted meeting of the state constitutional convention.
                    This lengthy session, with its added expense, had irritated many voters.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> The
                    committee report called attention to the fact that the first constitution of Indiana had been framed
                    in twenty-one days, whereas the convention to revise it had already spent four months in debate. It
                    stated that, while the act calling the convention did not actually limit its session, the committee
                    believed that the previous legislature had never expected a session longer than three months. If
                    "strict economy of time" had been used, the convention's work could have
                    been completed in the three-month span. The report concluded that "the people are restless

                    one to repeal the Free Banking Act of 1852. The subject of banking was so highly controversial in
                    Indiana in this era that it seemed impossible to reach any general agreement within either party on

                    now after only one year of free banking, it was proposed that the banking structure again be changed
                    by repealing the Free Banking Act of 1852. The repeal bill passed the senate, but when it reached
                    the house, a bolt was staged by those members who favored free banking, including Pratt, and the
                    attempt to repeal the act thus failed.<hi rend="sup">76</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These two sessions of the general assembly offered Pratt the only legislative experience he had until
                    his election to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate in 1869. In that interval of sixteen years, great changes were taking place in
                    the country. Pratt's party was in the last months of its existence when he left the
                    legislature in 1853. Out of the political flux that followed, a new party emerged in which he found
                    a place for his loyalty. In 1854 Stephen A. Douglas introduced the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Compromise line, and popular sovereignty as a method of solving the question of slavery
                    in the new territories. The political repercussions of that act are well known. The Whig party
                    disintegrated, and new political groups struggled for the allegiance of the voters. Out of this
                    change came the formation of the Republican party.</p>
            <p>There were at least five groups that combined to form this new party in Indiana—the
                    old-line Whigs, Know-Nothings, antislavery Democrats, temperance advocates, and former Free-Soilers.
                    But their fusion did not develop quickly. Skill and time were needed to accomplish this, and, above
                    all, leadership. Whig leadership appears to have been primarily responsible for this fusion, but
                    that leadership could not be too blatant or asserted too aggressively for fear of alienating some
                    elements within the new party.<hi rend="sup">77</hi> Pratt was a representative of three of these
                    elements in the embryonic party. He was an old-line Whig, an opponent of slavery, and a strong
                    advocate of temperance. His correspondence reveals no suspicion of any adherence to the Know-Nothing
                    movement.</p>

            <p>During the presidential election year of 1860 Pratt became very active. He attended the Republican

                    it was faced with unprecedented problems. With the outbreak of the Civil War, the
                    administration's abilities were severely tested in supporting the Union cause.</p>
            <p>These war years not only brought public sorrows for Pratt but private ones as well. Mrs.
                    Pratt's health had begun to fail as early as 1857. In the early summer of 1861, the family
                    spent a long vacation on Martha's Vineyard, where Pratt had an opportunity to engage in his

            <p>During the war years, Pratt was not inactive, but there was a decline in his political activity. He
                    did not forsake politics completely, but he was not an active campaigner. Yet he was the nominee of
                    the Republican legislators for one of Indiana's seats in the <placeName>

                    the methods of the Morton administration often irritated and even angered many voters in the state.
                    Nor was the course of the Lincoln administration popular with many of them. Consequently, the
                    political pendulum swung in reverse in the off-elections of 1862, giving the Democrats a majority in
                    both houses of the general assembly.<hi rend="sup">105</hi> What followed is a confused and sordid

                    governor and a War Democrat. His term would normally expire in March, 1863. By the time the assembly
                    convened, he had served less than a year, and if elected by the assembly in 1863, he would serve for
                    only the few weeks until the expiration of Bright's term.<hi rend="sup">106</hi> The
                    Republican caucus, therefore, chose Wright as their candidate for the long term. Pratt was then
                    nominated for the short term. The Democrats chose Thomas A. Hendricks to oppose Wright and David
                    Turpie to oppose Pratt. Thus, teacher and former student were rivals for the same seat. For a time,
                    a bolt by some Republican legislators blocked any business of the legislature, but the bolters were
                    finally persuaded to return.<hi rend="sup">107</hi> By a vote of 85–62, Turpie was

            <p>Near the close of the war Pratt increased his political activity. He sought a federal appointment,
                    either as district attorney or as judge of the Federal Court of Claims. His services to the
                    Republican party and his outstanding success in the legal profession apparently made him a strong
                    candidate for an appointment to the judicial branch of the federal government. He also had a good

                    quarters and the inability of the Indiana delegation to agree, President Lincoln turned to other
                    applicants for these posts.<hi rend="sup">110</hi> Unsuccessful in securing an appointment, Pratt
                    sought an elective office.</p>

                    the payment of government bonds in greenbacks, except where payment in coin was expressly called
                    for. The rapid contraction of the currency was condemned, as was the monopoly of public lands
                    "either by individuals or corporations." With reference to the question of Negro
                    suffrage, which was to emerge as a prominent issue in this campaign, the platform stated that
                    "the question of suffrage in all loyal states belongs to the people of those
                    states." Conrad Baker was nominated for governor and Will E. Cumback, for lieutenant

            <p>The district conventions were held amid considerable doubt regarding the results, since the

                    quarrels that erupted at a meeting of the state legislature.</p>
            <p>In 1869 the Republicans had a majority in both houses of the general assembly. They also had several
                    aspirants who hoped to succeed Thomas A. Hendricks in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate. There had been some sentiment in favor of Walter Q. Gresham. According to
                    Gresham's wife and biographer, the Republican state chairman, Governor-elect Conrad Baker,
                    and a number of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greenfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, Republicans favored his candidacy before the legislature met. Although Morton
                    and Gresham were antagonistic, Morton had agreed not to oppose Gresham. But Gresham found that Negro
                    suffrage was to be backed by the regular administration leaders, and he was opposed to pushing it at
                    that time. He therefore eliminated himself as a candidate before the legislature convened.<hi rend="sup">117</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Godlove S. Orth was another candidate who was eager for the honor. He solicited Pratt's
                    support, and wrote that Pratt could "do much among the Members elect [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] from your district, and with that support I shall feel much encouraged in my
                        efforts."<hi rend="sup">118</hi> But Orth's candidacy received very little
                    support either before the meeting of the legislature or after a deadlock developed. When the
                    legislature assembled, it was clear that Lieutenant-Governor Will E. Cumback, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was the strongest contender. Cumback had been very busy in building strength for this
                    election. Shortly after the elections of 1868, he wrote to George F. Chittendon, a member of the
                    lower house from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Henry counties, requesting him to write to some of his colleagues. He stated that
                    some of them might not know that "it was the understanding of our State Convention that if
                    I would make the race for Lieutenant Governor that I should have the preference for
                    senator," and added, "Should I succeed I will be in a position where I can help
                    you or any of your friends."<hi rend="sup">119</hi>

            <p>Three other men were likewise hoping that the lightning would strike them. One of these was James
                    Hughes. Hughes was a former professor of law at Indiana University who had served as a judge of the
                    circuit court, a member of the national House of Representatives from 1857–1859, and a
                    judge of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Court of Claims from 1860–1864. He was a War Democrat and had supported the
                    Morton administration. After the war he was appointed an agent for the Treasury Department. He was
                    now a member of the state senate and was inordinately ambitious for the senatorship. He was
                    politically restless and was always a man of strong personal feelings.<hi rend="sup">120</hi>
                    Richard W. Thompson was another candidate. He was urged by John D. Defrees, who was then
                    congressional printer, not to "let modesty keep you too much in the background,"
                    but to write to the Republican legislators and inform them of his interest in the office. Defrees
                    wrote that "it is about time that the custom of running for two offices at once should be
                        repudiated."<hi rend="sup">121</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The custom to which Defrees referred was that of electing governors to the Senate. It is probable
                    that Governor Baker hoped that the custom would be continued.<hi rend="sup">122</hi> The newspaper
                    accounts of the Republican caucuses, however, do not mention his name as being under consideration
                        there.<hi rend="sup">123</hi> Of all of these candidates, it was Cumback who showed the greatest
                    strength. In the first caucus of the Republican legislators, it was reported that he had 51 of the
                    76 votes of those attending, while the remaining votes were scattered among other contenders.<hi rend="sup">124</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A group of Cumback's personal enemies within the party, aided by the Democrats, engineered a
                    coup de gr$aCce that blasted his chances for election. The moving spirit of this group
                    was James Hughes, who had little respect for Cumback, whom he claimed had opposed his nomination as
                    a state senator and had excluded him from the senate's standing <list type="footnotes">

                    assignment since he represented the county in which the state university was located.<hi rend="sup">125</hi> Thus, with violent personal hostility toward Cumback and strong aspirations for the
                    office, Hughes hoped to unite the Democratic legislators with enough anti-Cumback Republican members
                    to be elected to the Senate.<hi rend="sup">126</hi> Through this coalition, a senate resolution was
                    passed calling on Governor Baker to transmit certain correspondence that had passed between Cumback
                    and Baker in 1868.<hi rend="sup">127</hi> In this way an opportunity was found to brand Cumback as
                    unethical and unfitted for the high office he sought.</p>
            <p>The correspondence consisted of four letters, the first of which was from Cumback to Baker, dated
                    January 6, 1868. In it, Cumback proposed that if Senator Hendricks were to resign while the
                    legislature was not in session, the governor could appoint his successor. If Baker were elected
                    governor, Cumback asked assurance of receiving the senatorial appointment from him, and, if such
                    assurance were given, Cumback promised not to contest the party nomination of Baker for governor.
                    Baker's reply was a scorcher. He stated that such a proposition was "corrupt and
                    indecent" and that he felt "humiliated that any human being should measure me by
                    so low a standard of common morality as to make it." Cumback then requested the return of
                    the first letter, but Baker refused.<hi rend="sup">128</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The striking disclosure of this year-old correspondence offered an opportunity for the senate to pass
                    a resolution censuring its own presiding officer for making "a corrupt and indecent attempt
                    to tamper with… the appointing power vested in the Governor."<hi rend="sup">129</hi> Anti-Cumback Republican legislators, including Hughes and nine others, now refused to vote
                    for Cumback. The resolution of censure was later expunged after it had served its partisan
                        purpose.<hi rend="sup">130</hi> Seven joint sessions of the two houses failed to elect a

                    on the first few ballots, it was unfortunate that he did not withdraw. When he did do so, he
                    attempted to throw his influence in favor of James C. Veatch,<hi rend="sup">132</hi> which merely
                    added to the difficulty. The strident voices of the factions indicated serious party
                    discord—just what the Democrats hoped would develop. Finally, on the morning of January
                    22, 1869, a tired Republican caucus nominated Pratt.<hi rend="sup">133</hi> When the eighth joint
                    session of the legislature met, the Republicans were able to elect him. The total number of votes
                    cast was 143, with 73 necessary to elect. Pratt received 83 votes and Hendricks, 60.<hi rend="sup">134</hi>

            <p>In telegraphing his congratulations, Speaker Colfax told Pratt that he "must be a child of

                    within the party. He had been actively identified with the party since 1856; candidates for party
                    nominations had solicited his influence; and his genial personality had won him many friends.<hi rend="sup">136</hi> He was the choice of the Republicans in the assembly for senator in 1863,
                    when there was little likelihood of success. He lived in the northern part of the state, and
                    sectional balancing of candidates played a part. There was no group within the party which bore him
                    a grudge, as was the case with Cumback. Pratt was a good compromise candidate, a man of stature in
                    his community and profession, and without any strong ties of obligation to a faction. After

            <p>Pratt's election also came without the active assistance of Morton, who might have been
                    expected to have exerted some influence on the election. The paucity of correspondence between Pratt
                    and Morton is not without significance in assessing their personal relationship. No congratulatory
                    letter from Morton is to be found among Pratt's papers. There is evidence of an episode
                    dating from 1865 that might have prevented cordial relationships. In that year Pratt went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D.C., during which time he checked on military volunteers from his
                    county—an act that appeared to question Governor Morton's figures in determining
                    draft quotas, and hence, was to be regarded by the governor as presumptuous on Pratt's
                    part. Word reached Morton through the columns of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> (Indiana) <hi rend="i">Democrat</hi> that this was the object of Pratt's
                    visit, and he at once challenged Pratt. Morton's letter of inquiry, delivered by an aide,
                    Charles J. Jacobs, was peremptory, terse, and arrogant.<hi rend="sup">138</hi> Pratt replied that
                    the primary object of his visit was to obtain a pass from the War Department to seek the grave of
                    his eldest son, killed in <placeName>

                    </placeName>; but he had also sought information on quotas from the War Department, although he had
                    made no discovery as stated in the newspaper article.<hi rend="sup">139</hi>

            <p>The relationship between the Indiana Senators continued to be a very formal one and never ripened
                    into cordiality during their association in the Senate. Morton had developed the habits and
                    attitudes of an autocrat. As his biographer wrote, Morton "suffered no peers among his
                        associates."<hi rend="sup">140</hi> Pratt had not worked closely with Morton during the
                    war. Never autocratic or vigorously aggressive, Pratt was a man of independent judgment and strong

                    conclusions, and acted upon them in an independent fashion.</p>
            <p>At the time of his election to the Senate, Pratt was fifty-five years of age. He had attempted to
                    take up some of the broken strands of his family life, caused by the death of his first wife and
                    eldest son, by remarrying. In 1865, he married a widow, Mrs. Jane D. Warren.<hi rend="sup">142</hi>
                    In 1869 Pratt was a strapping man, six feet four inches in height and 270 pounds in weight; later he
                    became much heavier.<hi rend="sup">143</hi> The story was current that, because of his size, a
                    special chair in the Senate chamber was constructed for him and later used by Senator David Davis,
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, another giant.<hi rend="sup">144</hi> His voice matched his height and weight. His
                    physical appearance and voice conveyed dignity, authority, and presence. In spite of this, however,
                    there was a modesty, bordering on genuine humility, that manifested itself after his election to the
                    Senate.</p>
            <p>The party wounds opened by the Cumback-Baker correspondence had not yet healed when Pratt reached the
                    astonishing conclusion to resign his seat in the Senate. He had been senator for less than a year
                    when this decision became known, and it created consternation among the party leaders in his state.
                    It was probably the greatest blunder of his career. Pratt's decision to resign was the
                    result of a number of factors. His letter to Governor Baker, forewarning him of the resignation,
                    gave limitations of his capabilities as the reason. He wrote: "Whatever capabilities I
                    possessed as a mere lawyer, I have none as a statesman—and it is too late in life to
                    qualify for this place."<hi rend="sup">145</hi> His formal letter of resignation, written
                    two days later, gave personal reasons—his legal practice, which was suffering, and the
                    need for directing the legal studies of his younger son.<hi rend="sup">146</hi> Pratt's
                    intention to resign became widely known, and there was considerable speculation over it. <placeName>

            <p>Whatever his reasons, they were overborne by influences from his home state. Even Morton wrote one of
                    his few letters to Pratt to encourage him by telling him: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>You greatly underrate your ability, and if you will but make a speech upon some question you
                            have examined, you will make a fine impression and be relieved effectively from the timidity
                            which oppresses you.… If, however, you have determined to resign or have done so,
                            I shall be glad to have you let me know, and also whether you have communicated your purpose
                            to other persons besides Governor Baker. There will be an immense scramble for the place and
                            I shall feel a deep interest in the character of your successor.<hi rend="sup">148</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote>Governor Baker and others were more urgent in their pleas, reminding Pratt that harm would
                    come to the party by opening old wounds, and of the impossibility of making an appointment that
                    would give general satisfaction.<hi rend="sup">149</hi> The party state chairman, A. H. Conner,
                    telegraphed that Pratt's resignation would "make a difference of thousands of
                    votes at the next election.… It would be charged that you are not in sympathy with our
                        party."<hi rend="sup">150</hi> Pratt yielded to this pressure and decided to retain his
                    seat for the remainder of his term. He determined to fulfill his duties to the best of his ability.
                    During his six years of service, he would earn the esteem and confidence of his colleagues and
                    establish a reputation for integrity and faithful performance of his tasks.</p>

                    his poetic and literary ability."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> From our vantage point of some six
                    decades later it seems fitting, therefore, to look again at the career of Chief Simon Pokagon, and,
                    if necessary, to re-evaluate his literary contributions.</p>
            <p>Unrestrained but honest emotion is perhaps the dominant characteristic of Pokagon's work as
                    a whole. He is sorely troubled by the social and economic difficulties confronting the Indians of
                    his generation. He is deeply sensitive to the romantic virtues and beauties of unexploited nature;
                    and in <hi rend="i">Queen of the Woods</hi> his affection for his ill-starred family is poignant and
                    personal. But stylistically it is obvious that Pokagon's English phrases and figures merely
                    echo the polite literary conventions of his day ("the woodland choir,"
                    "the happy hunting-ground," "our pale-faced neighbours,"
                    "sweet little rosebud," "naked innocence," "bloom of
                    youth," "all nature slept," "the dark clouds rolled
                    away," and so on). This emulation of the popular and often trite phraseology of the
                    romantic-sentimental tradition weakens the vigor of his English style and disappoints a modern
                    reader. One feels that he is not speaking with the spontaneous voice of his own primeval culture,
                    but rather is borrowing the white man's nineteenth-century clich$eAs.
                    Nonetheless, his intrinsic subject—to the extent that it may be distinguished from its
                    verbal form—is original and fresh; and <hi rend="i">Queen of the Woods</hi> is a unique
                    document from a genuine Indian source, an emotional and at times lyrical remembrance of things past
                    rather than a synthetic, sterile exercise such as <hi rend="i">Hiawatha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be gratuitous to point out, also, that in putting <hi rend="i">Queen of the Woods</hi> and his
                    other manuscripts in order for the publisher, Pokagon doubtless had considerable editorial
                    assistance. His handwritten letters which remain show a certain unconcern for the niceties of
                    spelling and punctuation; and the syntax of some of his published work is not beyond reproach.

            <p>But many otherwise able authors have shown some deficiency in verbal mechanics; and in view of the
                    unusual background from which Pokagon wrote, any syntactical criticism here would be picayune. <hi rend="i">O-Gi-Maw-Kwe Mit-I-Gwa-Ki (Queen of the Woods)</hi> is not a masterpiece of world
                    literature, it is true. It is indeed rare in its genre, a literary oddity. But the reader may
                    overlook its sentimentalities and eccentricities in view of the novelty of its contents and depth of
                    its feeling; and if he reads sympathetically his emotions may be touched. Too, this book vivifies a
                    segment of our national past which often is conveniently forgotten. But perhaps its ultimate worth
                    lies in the candid self-portrait of a son of the now-vanished forest. His prose style may have been
                    vitiated by his superficial and uncritical contacts with English literature; but his integrity as an
                    individual was not destroyed by the white man's culture. A member of a mistreated minority
                    group, he was able to face his changing and difficult environment courageously.</p>

            <p>Turning now to a more specific investigation of Simon Pokagon's writings, we find that his
                        <hi rend="i">Queen of the Woods</hi> is the central document. The events here related were
                    derived directly from Pokagon's private life, and the book itself is the best exemplar of
                    his literary style. Concerning this work the biographer of Chief Leopold Pokagon, Simon's
                    father, comments thus effusively: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>His <hi rend="i">Queen of the Woods</hi> has the tang, the zest, and the woodsy flavor of
                            life. It is pulsing with sympathy, heartfelt emotion, and sensitive feeling; a quaint
                            mixture of information, fact, history, pathos, romance, and poetry combined; a plaintive,
                            yet uncomplaining plea for justice and an eloquent and stirring plea for temperance. Lofty
                            sentiments, wise philosophical thoughts, and serious reflection temper and vivify all his
                                writings.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>This tale (written first in his native tongue and then translated into English by the author) begins
                    at the time of Pokagon's return to his people after his years of white schooling. It is
                    narrated in the first person, and in spite of romantic overtones is largely a factual account. His
                    friend and publisher, C. H. Engle, of <placeName>

               </placeName>, referred to it as
                    "the historical sketch" of Pokagon's life, and labeled it a
                    "real romance of Indian life." "Nearly all the persons mentioned in the
                    narrative bear their real names, and were personally known to many yet living."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>Some unusual aspects of the book immediately become apparent. The most obvious is the inclusion of
                    many Algonquin-Algaic<hi rend="sup">11</hi> terms, following which Pokagon gives the English
                    translation in parentheses. This intrusion of unfamiliar and difficult Indian expressions results in
                    a bumpy awkwardness which at first seems to break the flow of his English style. Careful reading
                    indicates, however, that these interpolated words have a strong rhythm of their own. Most of these
                    are single nouns or brief phrases, but in the latter part of the tale the author often inserts
                    complete sentences. He defends this odd bilingual practice: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>"The Algonquin Language," a prefatory treatise of thirteen pages, presents in a
                    technical and succinct form the basic data of the speech system. Far from being a "sort of
                    `gibberish,'" according to Pokagon, Algaic contains some twenty thousand root
                    words on which numerous variations may be built. The seventeen letters of the alphabet include only
                    four vowels, of unchanging pronunciation, plus several diphthongs. Nine parts of speech are
                    distinguishable. Peculiarities of the language include great liberty in transposing word order; a
                    very involved use of different particles depending on gender and function of accompanying words; a
                    clipping or shortening of words when grouped in phrases; and a comprehensive body of agglutinative
                    terms to express family relationships. The basic structure of the sentence hinges on the verb, and
                    "nearly all the words in our language can be transformed into verbs." His own view
                    of the effectiveness and beauty of the Algonquin language is implicit in his apology that in
                    translating his manuscript into English in many places he lost the "force and
                    euphony" of the original.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second obvious feature of <hi rend="i">Queen of the Woods</hi> is its semi-poetic form. Although
                    the story begins in ordinary prose, it soon shifts to comparatively regular iambics so that, had the
                    author chosen, much of the tale might have been printed as blank verse. This style (no doubt derived
                    from Pokagon's reading of the English poets) might have seemed to him also to reflect the
                    patterns of his own speech. One undeniable echo is that of the King James version of the Bible. The
                    resulting regular "beat" occasionally becomes obtrusive, but there is
                    unquestionably more variety than in the insistent rhythms of <hi rend="i">Hiawatha,</hi> for
                    example; and the highly sentimental-emotional-mystical mood occasionally reached in the tale might
                    justify a "poetic" line.</p>
            <p>The vital framework is the factual account of Pokagon's courtship, marriage, idyllic family
                    life, and subsequent deep tragedy. To this are added many marginal notes on the natural scene and
                    Indian domestic arts (more trustworthy and persuasive than Longfellow's eclectic data). But

            <p>Pokagon's first view of Lonidaw, his future bride, with "raven tresses floating in

                    pigeons and bobolinks as a snow-white deer gamboled about her. Pokagon thought that such creatures

            <p>Away at school again after his vacation, Pokagon realized his inescapable love for Lonidaw, so when
                    springtime came he went in search of her. Young love at first was inarticulate, and even after his
                    declaration she protested that his white education had spoiled him for the simple life: "
                    `I am but pa-gwag ab-i-not ji mit-tig (a wild child of the woods), wild as ben-ish ig (the birds)
                    that gather round.… but should we wed, I fear you soon would tire of my native woodland
                    ways, and crush this childish o-daw nin (heart of mine).' "<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
                    But when the moon of flowers came and mating birds were moving north, young Pokagon and his beloved
                    Lonidaw were united, without benefit of priest or formal ceremony. On an inland lake where wild rice
                    was plentiful he built their wigwam home; and on his return from hunting trips he always hailed her,
                    " `Hoi (Hallo), o-gi-maw-kwe mit-i-gwa-ki (queen of the woods).' "<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After two years Olondaw, their son, was born; then Hazeleye, their little girl. The children grew up
                    happily, little Olondaw learning to make and handle a bow, and his sister playing with her Indian
                    doll. A white priest offered to pay the expenses if Olondaw were sent away to school. Pokagon
                    agreed, hoping that his son, now twelve years old, would become "learned, great, and good,
                    and thereby be of great service to our race." But Lonidaw was fearful of the future; and on
                    the eve of Olondaw's departure she dreamed that by the trail she found two young robins
                    which were drawn hypnotically toward a monstrous snake. As she tried to grasp a club, it struck its
                    victim; and in her dream "the snake within its jaws held fast, not the bird, but the living
                    skeleton of her son, struggling to escape."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This premonition proved tragically true, for after three years at the white man's school
                    Olondaw graduated from bottle-hunting in the back alleys of the town to an ineradicable craving for
                    the familiar firewater. Pokagon lowers the final curtain abruptly: "I do not wish to bleed
                    my own heart, or sadden yours; suffice it to say, as darkness succeeds the meteor's sudden
                    glare, so his young life went out and left us in the midnight of despair."<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this was only the first act in the tragedy. "Dear little Hazeleye alone was left us

                    while Pokagon was absent and Hazeleye was fishing on the lake, two drunken white fishermen rammed
                    their boat into her bark canoe, which capsized and threw her into the water. Lonidaw, on shore,
                    screamed for help, but the drunken men made no effort to save the child. The mother plunged
                    desperately to the rescue, but almost strangling was herself pulled to safety by Zowan, the faithful
                    family dog. Lonidaw lingered briefly, partly in delirium, until one evening she said: "
                    `Pokagon, see ke-sus (the sun) is sinking low; while it is going down, I shall pass into manito
                    aukee we-de (the spirit land beyond). You have always been kind to me, yet I must bid you farewell
                    until we meet beyond tchi-be-gam-mig (the grave)….' "<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Soon a simple procession of mourning, white-blanketed Indian friends bore her body to a
                    beautiful headland overlooking the lake; white water-lilies were laid gently on her grave.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The brief remainder of the book is made up of a sincere but disjointed temperance tract, inspired by
                    the dying wish of Lonidaw that Pokagon should speak out against the source of the great triple
                    tragedy in their own family circle.</p>
            <p>Three short but unique publications by Pokagon also merit comment. The only other work listed on the
                    title page of <hi rend="i">Queen of the Woods</hi> is <hi rend="i">Red Man's Greeting</hi>
                    (originally—and more aptly—entitled <hi rend="i">Red Man's

            <p>From this perspective of Pokagon's literary contributions we might now glance briefly
                    backward at the tribal environment from which he had emerged. Of the competitive cultural forces at
                    work within him, the central drive was certainly to maintain and defend his own native values, with
                    only a collateral concern for the veneer of white literary culture.</p>
            <p>Simon Pokagon had succeeded his two older brothers in the tribal leadership handed down from their
                    father, Chief Leopold Pokagon. For the forty years prior to his death in 1841, Leopold had been the
                    head of the Pokagon band of the Potawatomi Indians, an offshoot of the larger Algonquin family.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Simon, the youngest of Chief Leopold's numerous children, was born
                    in 1830 during the clan's annual migration north to their sugar-maple camps and cornfields

                            department of the university. Pokagon presumably attended the trade school. "It is

            <p>Pokagon's autobiographical romance, as we have seen, presents details of his life with
                    Lonidaw, daughter of Chief Sinagaw of the Rush Lake band (who had been able to rejoin his family
                    after the tribal relocation). But after the death of their two children and of Lonidaw herself at
                    the age of only thirty-five, Pokagon devoted himself to the welfare of his small tribal group and of
                    the Potawatomi as a whole. He visited Lincoln in the White House shortly after his inauguration to
                    plead the Indian cause, and again just before the President's death; and in 1874 he
                    interviewed General Grant. Finally, in 1894 Pokagon succeeded in arranging the payment of
                    $104,000 by the government to the Potawatomi in compensation for the harsh terms of the
                    original cession of their lands (at the price of about fifty cents per acre), and for various
                    annuities previously withheld.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> He also aided <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The flow of immigrants into the West had quickened during the beginning of the second decade of the
                    nineteenth century, and not even continued Indian troubles and the War of 1812 could do more than
                    slow it somewhat. With the coming of peace, the westward movement became a veritable flood, and in
                    the five years from 1816 to 1821 five new western states were added to the Union. The author of the
                    letter reproduced here apparently did not wait for news of the end of the War of 1812, which came
                    early in 1815, to begin his journey to <placeName>

                        Studies in America, 1607–1884.</hi> By David D. Van Tassel. (<placeName>

            <p>The development of historical writing in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> has long needed a new interpreter—an individual who could see and comprehend
                    the various and divergent attempts made by Americans to bring meaning to their heritage. The
                    historiographer's task has not been easy, for both Old World traditions and New World
                    novelties have influenced him. In addition, he frequently was caught between the forces of
                    parochialism and nationalism. And his point of view altered as the country changed. The product from
                    the pen of the trained historian differed, both in philosophy and in method, from that of the
                    annalist, the antiquarian, the chauvinistic chronicler. Yet the fabric of written history is woven
                    from all these strange strands and multicolored threads.</p>
            <p>Mr. Van Tassel seeks to pick away each of the braids, to hold them to the light of scrutiny, to
                    explain the origin and the impact of the inkles of popular history, documania, local narrative, and
                    national history. His contribution starts with three chapters devoted to the colonial origins of
                    local history (1607–1776), in which is stressed the fact that "the first impetus
                    to historical writing in colonial America came of the desire to promote settlement and investment in
                    particular colonies, to defend or explain colonial administration, and to answer the demand for
                    information about the new world" (p. 9). Then follow five chapters which set forth the
                    roots of national historical writing, discuss the new role of local history, trace the rise of
                    societies, treat of the creation of national heroes, and examine efforts to promote a Republican
                    view of national history.</p>
            <p>The struggle between nationalism and localism began with the close of the War of 1812 and terminated
                    in 1850. In presenting this theme, the author, in addition to describing a growing appetite for the
                    "materials of history," weighs the labors of the romantic nationalists such as
                    Bancroft, Irving, and Parkman. He assesses the work of local historians imbued with the critical
                    spirit, including individuals such as John Gilmary Shea. A final section, in five chapters,
                    demonstrates the effect of the Civil War upon historical writing, the place that local history
                    played during the war years, considers the "reunion" of the national past,
                    emphasizes the culmination of the critical spirit, and terminates with the year 1884 and with what
                    the author conceives to be the triumph of national history.</p>
            <p>"Thus in the waning days of the old year [1884]," writes Mr. Van Tassel,
                    "as Grover <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the victorious Democrats made preparations to assume control of the new national
                    state, the professional historians prepared to assume the task of recording America's past.
                    The long age of the amateur historian had ended." There is, no <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-057-2-062"/> doubt, more than a sliver of substance in this hallelujah. Yet one
                    wonders if, indeed, the day of the amateur historian had come to a close and if "local
                    historians henceforth would defer to the professional" (p. 179).</p>
            <p>All in all, Recording America's Past is marked by careful research, balanced judgment, and
                    sound interpretation. No doubt not all historians would agree with all the conclusions, but this is
                    only natural, and many controversial questions hang on the delicate scale of semantics. One could
                    wish that the bibliography had included at least a few references to the inception and maturing of
                    foreign historical societies and scholarly associations, for it is surprising, as the author makes
                    apparent, how organizations in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> leaned upon across-the-Atlantic counterparts. Such titles as Joan Evans, <hi rend="i">A
                        History of the Society of Antiquaries,</hi> or the volume edited by Levi Fox, <hi rend="i">English Historical Scholarship in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries,</hi> might have
                    provided stimulating background. But Mr. Van Tassel makes perfectly clear that his bibliography is
                    selective. The Appendix, a list of historical societies arranged chronologically according to date
                    of founding, provides a handy and valuable check list. Professional historians, graduate students,
                    and innumerable amateur historians should, indeed, be grateful for this handbook.</p>

            <p>Historians are constantly applying the correctives of fact and logic to the romanticism, dubious
                    legends, and downright hoaxes which clutter the annals of all countries, including <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. In this tradition, Father Steck's work, a summary of his earlier and
                    voluminous writings, exposes what he considers to be the exaggerations and fabrications in the
                    accepted accounts of the career of Jacques Marquette.</p>
            <p>The author's major points are his contentions that Marquette probably did not accompany
                    Jolliet on the famous exploration of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> in 1673 and was not the founder of the famous <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
                    </placeName> Mission. He was, rather, a humble missionary whose undistinguished career was falsely
                    inflated into importance by his superior and others to advance the interests of the Jesuits in their
                    struggle with the State for power in the West.</p>
            <p>Father Steck employs various evidence to establish his theses. Negatively, he points out that
                    Marquette was never officially appointed to accompany Jolliet, nor does the latter mention him in
                    the records of the expedition, surely a peculiar omission. Father Steck also seeks to establish, by
                    a critical examination of many documents, that the accounts <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-057-2-063"/> of
                    the exploration which do mention Marquette, or are attributed to his pen, are frauds which were
                    written or "edited" by the superior general of the Jesuit missions in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>This book is a well-written and fascinating example of historical detective work through analysis and
                    criticism of documents. Several reservations must be noted, however. Because much of his argument
                    rests upon negative evidence and rationalization, it is nearly impossible for the author completely
                    to prove his central points. Father Steck, therefore, exceeds the bounds of scholarly caution when
                    he occasionally states that certain conclusions are "firmly established" or
                    inescapable. Also, he has neglected some secondary works which would help to establish his
                    contentions, notably Grace L. Nute's <hi rend="i">Caesars of the Wilderness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Otherwise, Father Steck has done a good job. His evidence is well-handled and his reasoning and
                    verdicts are generally persuasive. Henceforth, historians of seventeenth-century North America must
                    ponder his measured conclusion that "Marquette's participation in the 1673
                    expedition [is] at least seriously doubtful if not improbable" (p. 114).</p>
            <p>Christopher Lloyd's <hi rend="i">The Capture of Quebec</hi> is a volume in the <hi rend="i">British Battles Series</hi> of popular accounts of the causes, course, and results of
                    significant conflicts. Since Francis Parkman wrote the classic account of the siege of Quebec in his
                        <hi rend="i">Montcalm and Wolfe</hi> (1884), the story has been frequently retold without
                    essential change. Lloyd's volume follows the stereotyped presentation from the fall of
                    Louisburg and the expedition up the St. Lawrence through the futile Montmorency attack to the
                    perilous ascent from the Anse de Foulon and the climactic battle on the Plains of Abraham. Thus this
                    volume again parades the tired facts and sequence but, remarkably, imparts freshness by new patterns
                    of emphasis. For example, Lloyd stresses the often-neglected role of the navy, and occasionally dims
                    the spotlight on Wolfe and Montcalm by turning it upon the soldier in the ranks and upon such
                    secondary leaders as the brilliant French aide, Count de Bougainville.</p>
            <p>This volume is a generally accurate and very readable account. Professional historians may lament the
                    absence of footnotes and a complete bibliography and the neglect of some recent Canadian
                    scholarship, but the book was not written for professional historians. It is intended to be a
                    popular history and succeeds in being a good one. The publishers also deserve praise for a
                    technically excellent product.</p>

            <p>This is the second volume of the memoirs of a leader of the Swedish migration to <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the 1840's. Published first in Sweden in 1861 and 1862, Unonius'
                    work encouraged the continuing <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-057-2-064"/> emigration of his countrymen to
                    America. In the first volume the author told of the migration and pioneer experiences in the new
                    country, while this volume is mainly concerned with his own career as a priest of the Protestant
                    Episcopal Church of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. When the Swedes came here, few of the ministers of the State church of Sweden came
                    with them, and their settlements were without spiritual leadership. If churches were established,
                    they were affiliated with the Norwegian Luthern church, or the Methodist, or Baptist. To Unonius,
                    however, the church most compatible to his own beliefs was the Episcopal church, represented in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> by dedicated young missionary priests, and he decided he would prepare himself for
                    ministering to his own people.</p>
            <p>It was at great personal sacrifice of both money and fatherly care for his family that he attended
                    the newly founded Episcopal mission and seminary at Nashotah, where he was welcomed and encouraged
                    in his determination to study for holy orders. He had been influenced initially to take this step by
                    the founder of Nashotah House, James Lloyd Breck, and by Bishop Jackson Kemper, the indefatigable
                    director of the church's activities in the West.</p>
            <p>After finishing his work at Nashotah, the Rev. Mr. Unonius worked for some time among the Swedish
                    settlements in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, and finally accepted a call to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he established St. Ansgarius Church in the Scandinavian neighborhood. To secure
                    funds he made an extended and successful money-raising trip to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, where he also won the sympathy of Jenny Lind, who contributed generously to St.
                    Ansgarius. Finally, deciding that his work in America was done, he returned to Sweden.</p>
            <p>This is a bare-bones sketch of the "plot" of Unonius' story. The book is
                    not a collection of raw source material, but a well-integrated narrative of one man's
                    experiences, written from his own diaries and letters and other documentary material, supplemented
                    occasionally from other sources. It is not simply personal recollection from an unaided memory.</p>
            <p>For the general reader, as well as the social historian, there is much material on the adjustment of
                    the uprooted Swedes to conditions in a new environment; and there is particular emphasis on the
                    extremely difficult situation in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where a people with a rural background had to fit into an urban environment. There are
                    also interesting chapters, not completely from first-hand knowledge, about the Swedish community at
                    Bishop's Hill in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and about the eighteenth-century Swedish settlement in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>But the paramount importance of the book is its contribution to the history of churches and religion
                    in America. There is new light on the Episcopal church on the middle western frontier; on Kemper,
                    Breck, and William Adams (associated with Breck at Nashotah House); on life at the seminary; and on
                    the controversy in the church between the Evangelicals and the Anglo-Catholics. Unonius, as would be
                    expected from a disciple of Kemper and Breck, was of the Anglo-Catholic faction. There is also much
                    information on the rivalry between the Norwegian and Swedish Lutherans, and between both and
                    Unonius' Episcopal congregations. The book is competently edited, and all persons mentioned
                    are identified.</p>
            <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-057-2-065"/>
            <p>And, finally, the book is an unconscious character study of a man of God, continually wrestling with
                    his human nature, a man who had to be eternally reminding himself of his Christian obligation to be
                    charitable and loving. Although Unonius never satisfied himself, the reader knows that a lesser man

            <p>While scientists work in the seclusion of the laboratory, their theories often influence history on a
                    grand scale. The discoveries of Copernicus, Newton, and Darwin shattered old beliefs and excited
                    debate in fields far removed from science. In <hi rend="i">The Leopard's Spots,</hi>
                    William Stanton revives a debate of less renown and brings to life a group of scientists known as
                    the "American School" of anthropology. This book tells the story of their theories
                    about the origin of the human species and the conflict aroused by their ideas. Impressed by the
                    differences between Indian, Negro, and White, these men concluded that each race represented a
                    separate and distinct species. The members of the American School reached this conclusion by
                    diffrent paths. Study of his large collection of human skulls convinced Samuel G. Morton, while the
                    census of 1840 and the need for a scientific defense of slavery converted Dr. Josiah Nott. Work amid
                    the pyramids of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ua">Egypt</country>
                    </placeName> persuaded George R. Gliddon of the plurality of the races, while study of the Indian
                    mounds of the Midwest led Ephraim G. Squier to this view. The mere sight of a Negro led Louis
                    Agassiz, the most famous member of the school, to conclude that the White and Negro constituted
                    separate species. Like every band of enthusiasts, this group had its charlatan and its special
                    pleader. The quackery of Gliddon contrasted with the research of Morton and the partisanship of Nott
                    with the integrity of Agassiz. All and all, they area colorful lot, vividly described by the author.</p>
            <p>Stanton concentrates on the impact of the American School's findings on American life,
                    without slighting either the personalities or ideas of its adherents. The eighteenth-century belief
                    in the unity of the species and the equality of man rested on the authority of science, scriptures,
                    and the writers of the Enlightenment. According to Genesis, God created man in a single act, and
                    scientists explained race pecularities as a result of climate and custom. Where the old science
                    found equality and therefore natural liberty, the new science found inequality and the
                    appropriateness of slavery. The pluralist theories of the American School excited more than a
                    scientific debate; it revived the ancient quarrel of science and religion and threatened to become
                    an issue in the slavery controversy. These theories held profound implications for a nation which
                    took its Bible seriously and was already quarreling over the validity of Negro slavery.</p>
            <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-057-2-066"/>
            <p>In describing the scientific debate which resulted, the author gives the impression that all reason
                    and research were on the side of the pluralists and that their victory was complete. This
                    interpretation overlooks the fact that the pluralists' opponents included several noted
                    scientists as well as theologians who were far from defeated. The author also offers some
                    interesting explanations for the failure of the South to adopt the pluralistic theory as a defense
                    for slavery. He concludes, that with the exception of Nott, the members of the American School were
                    more anticlerical than proslavery. Stanton also argues that, faced with the dilemma of accepting
                    either the pluralist theory of the origin of the species or the scriptural account of Genesis,
                    southerners clung to the Bible and rejected the theory. While this conclusion seems correct, he
                    fails to present documentary evidence to substantiate his interpretation. All in all,
                    Stanton's book examines a difficult subject with clarity and style. For a look at science

                    By Henry H. Simms. (<placeName>

            <p>In his <hi rend="i">Emotion at High Tide</hi> Professor Simms, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> State University, says that his work "covers, with greater thoroughness, more
                    facets of the abolition question than any book on the period under consideration" (p. v).
                    The book deals with such matters as reactions in the North and South to antislavery propaganda, the
                    differences between the abolitionists and the colonizationists, and the differences within the
                    antislavery ranks between Garrisonians and anti-Garrisonians. There are also chapters which relate
                    the antislavery movement, especially the petition controversy, to the politics of the period and
                    which show how politicians prevented the major parties from becoming embroiled in the slavery
                    controversy in the elections of 1836 and 1840. Finally the author deals with the role of the
                    anti-slavery forces in the fight over the annexation of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> and with the relationship of the antislavery movement to certain aspects of
                    Anglo-American relationships.</p>
            <p>There is no bibliography, but there are numerous footnotes which show that Professor Simms has made
                    extensive use of antislavery literature, the publications of the American Colonization Society, the
                        <hi rend="i">Congressional Globe,</hi> the published correspondence of Birney, Weld, Tappan, and
                    the leading political figures of the period, as well as contemporary newspapers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Emotion at High Tide</hi> covers the same period as Barnes's <hi rend="i">Anti-slavery Impulse</hi> and deals with many of the same subjects. It presents details not
                    found in the earlier work, but in the opinion of this reviewer it adds little of significance to the
                    contribution made by Barnes and <pb n="161" id="VAA4025-057-2-067"/> others who have written on the
                    antislavery movement. In spite of its title the book does not recapture the emotional climate of the
                    period, nor does the author attempt to analyze the reasons for the intense emotions which
                    abolitionism evoked.</p>

            <p>This crisply and well-written little volume will not replace the more detailed histories of the
                    Confederacy, but it will rank high in the literature of that ill-fated experiment. In carefully
                    machined sentences Roland has told a clearer and more balanced story than many authors who have used
                    several times as many pages.</p>
            <p>The major shortcomings of the book appear to result from the limited wordage allotted to the volumes
                    in this series and are most noticeable in the first two chapters. Flashing back from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> secession convention to explain the background of departure from the Union and of the
                    birth of the Confederacy, the author seems forced into certain oversimplifications and
                    generalizations that produce some distortion. His offense here, however, is not great. On the other
                    hand, it is difficult to see why one-eighth of the work should be devoted to King Cotton diplomacy.</p>
            <p>The desirable and undesirable characteristics and traits of the military and civilian leaders are
                    analyzed, and the strengths and weaknesses of the policies of the central government are
                    thoughtfully assessed. Occasionally, the possible results of a different course of action are
                    explored. The states' opposition to the central government on numerous issues is
                    objectively depicted, but this centrifugence is considered only one of many factors in the fall of
                    the Confederacy. (One often wonders why this opposition in the South has been viewed as a legitimate
                    and more or less expected manifestation of states' rights, while in the North comparable
                    objection to the actions of the central government has been considered copperheadism or near
                    treason.) In evaluating the causes of the Confederacy's defeat, Roland seems to subscribe
                    to the Ramsdell idea that the handling of financial problems was the weakest link in the Confederate
                    chain—but not the only weak link. Certainly, disastrous inflation seriously affected the
                        <hi rend="i">esprit de corps,</hi> and the cresting and troughing of civilian and military
                    morale is nicely related to financial and military success and failure.</p>
            <p>Nor would this author single out failure of leadership as being responsible for defeat: in many
                    instances the leaders performed admirably; at other times they made serious errors. The omission of
                    those errors would not have insured victory, but "failure to avoid them made defeat
                    certain" (p. 91). Roland's final conclusion on this matter is that the South
                    "could triumph only by exercising over the North <pb n="162" id="VAA4025-057-2-068"/>
                    sufficiently greater unity, skill, and will to compensate for the inadequacy of resources. In this
                    she failed" (p. 193). Is not the amazing thing that the will to resist was sustained as
                    long as it was?</p>
            <p>This interesting narrative, concerned basically with broad movements, problems, and explanations,
                    probably contains too little of the horror of the great American struggle, but it is a fine
                    recounting of the tragic splendor of those four years.</p>

            <p>Somehow, the fact of Northern superiority in population, resources, and control of the seas has been
                    contrasted with a myth of Union inferiority in tactics, leadership, and conduct on the
                    battlefield—a myth now being fed a daily diet by television where it seems the Yankees
                    never are able to win a battle, and most of them are scoundrels facing southern knights anyway.
                    Books such as the two under review go a long way to dispel that myth, for here are recorded great
                    deeds on the battlefield by the men in blue.</p>

                    than one usually finds in most recent accounts. The other is an account of a campaign, told in a way
                    which captures the atmosphere of battle and its intense drama. Both will be welcomed by all students

            <p>For each episode, the author carefully describes the ground, provides the tactical setting, locates

                    detail will be useful to the student. Nonetheless, the device used in the army's World War
                    II histories, which was to print all designations of enemy units in italics, might have been helpful
                    in this volume. Appendices trace the formation of regiments comprising the brigade and give
                    biographical data on the commanders.</p>

                    While <hi rend="i">The Iron Brigade</hi> is a story of western men in eastern battles, this is a
                    story which includes the transfer of a corps from the Army of the Potomac (and on the Confederate

            <p>Colonel Downey too is careful to describe the ground; he provides the dramatis personae, gives the
                    general strategic and logistical situation, and in one of the most valuable parts of the book,
                    describes the firearms used. He opens the scene in this way: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Clouds hovered over Lookout Mountain in waning November of the year 1863. The glory of its
                            fall foliage had faded, but a hint of haze hanging in the air silvered the forests that
                            clothed it—oak and pine, sourwood and dogwood and black gum, hickory and tulip
                            trees. When that haze thickened into mists and fog, the clouds appeared to have descended to
                            robe all the mountainsides in white.</p>
                        <p>Massive, precipitous, the mountain seemed the boundary wall of the world to one who scanned
                            it, and in actuality for the space of those autumn days it was the border of a nation
                            divided. On it and around it were entrenched and encamped 150,000 men under arms, determined
                            to hold or to break over that mighty barrier. (p. 3)</p>
                        <p>Once more the mountains filled their varied roles in this campaign they dominated. As before,
                            they were barriers and natural ramparts. <pb n="164" id="VAA4025-057-2-070"/> Their wooded
                            sides were mighty screens until their peaks were gained. And now the gaps, which pierced
                            them and made them passable for marching armies, provided a new potential. They became
                            entrances to a trap. (p. 75)</p>

                    plausible case. While the book has its weaknesses, it achieves the author's purpose of

                        <settlement type="city">Hancock</settlement>

            <p>The editor of <hi rend="i">Advance and Retreat</hi> has done an excellent job of explaining the
                    shortcomings of the original narrative by Lieutenant General J. B. Hood of the Confederate army. The
                    book is not an objective narrative nor an accurate history, but was written originally as an answer
                    to some accusations which had been aimed at Hood. It is essentially an elaboration of the angry
                    report Hood turned in shortly after he resigned from the army.</p>
            <p>As a general, Hood does not rate among the "superb." At first glance, the reader
                    might wonder why the Indiana University Press has reprinted an account which even the editor of the
                    book admits has serious shortcomings. Hood's <hi rend="i">Advance and Retreat</hi>
                    illustrates, however, the internal problems of the Confederate army and provides additional
                    information about the fighting around <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> campaign. Probably its greatest value is that it gives Hood's reply to his
                    critics and throws some light on his actions during and after the Civil War. The book must be read,
                    however, with a clear understanding that it is Hood's defense against criticisms aimed at
                    him by his enemies. If the reader uses this approach, he will find the volume useful.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Wearing of the Gray</hi> is a reprint of a book originally published in 1867. In the
                    editor's Introduction, an interesting account of John Esten Cooke's life is given
                    along with the observation that Cooke would have been relatively unimportant as a writer had it not
                    been for these eyewitness sketches written during and after the Civil War.</p>
            <p>Certainly the best parts of the book are those describing camp life and everyday incidents. Cooke
                    writes in a vivid journalistic style. While the writing is colored by his personal feelings and
                    attitudes, his report of Confederate military life is excellent. The reader should understand that
                    the book is best from the standpoints of local color and personal interest. Its statements about the
                    numbers of troops involved in battles should be compared with other sources which are perhaps more
                    accurate in their statistics than Cooke.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Wearing of the Gray</hi> is a book which will appeal to young students of history as
                    well as to Civil War buffs. It is certainly one of the best sources for a personal report on the
                    lives of some of the most famous Confederate generals. Particularly interesting are the accounts of
                    General Stuart and his escapades, which are graphically discussed in this book. It is a volume which
                    all Civil War readers will want on their book shelves.</p>

            <p>Americans seem strangely reluctant to study the history of their northern neighbor, for the bulk of
                    writing on this subject is still done by Canadians. But American scholars slowly are becoming aware
                    of research possibilities north of the border; and in these years of the Civil War centennial, it is
                    inevitable that at least one aspect of Canadian-American affairs will undergo careful scrutiny. This
                    work by Robin Winks is an extensive study of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>'s relations with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> during the tension-filled Civil War years.</p>
            <p>By utilizing unexploited sources—especially consular correspondence—the author
                    has arrived at some unconventional conclusions that will force modification of many time-honored
                    cliches, including the traditional picture of a "century of peace" along the
                    border. From 1861 to 1865 the two countries were not good neighbors, and relations were marred by
                    several ugly incidents. Winks lights up the triangle of Anglo-American-Canadian affairs and the
                    effect of Confederate diplomacy on them. He explores Canadian enlistment in the Union army and
                    demolishes another historical myth; according to him the number was fewer than commonly supposed. He
                    also examines the attitude of the Canadian press toward the war, gives full details on the <hi rend="i">Chesapeake</hi> and St. Albans affairs, and shows the ineptness of Confederate efforts
                    to embroil <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> in war with the North through Canadian-based raids on Union territory.</p>
            <p>This volume grew out of the author's doctoral study at Johns Hopkins and is subject to the
                    virtues and vices of dissertation-inspired books. Ideally all research should be publishable, but
                    the transition from thesis to book requires modification in form and content. A pruning of an
                    overladen foreword (including some ill-calculated wit), of obtrusive footnotes, extraneous text, and
                    greater attention to style (the author has a penchant for misplaced modifiers) would have made the
                    book more readable. Moreover, the work is marred by numerous factual mistakes. After an excellent
                    rundown of the literature on the <hi rend="i">Trent</hi> affair, Winks makes the elementary mistake
                    of stating that the <hi rend="i">Trent,</hi> after its release by Captain Charles Wilkes of the <hi rend="i">San Jacinto,</hi> "continued her voyage to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>" (p. 70). Actually the ship was a mail-packet engaged in the Caribbean area
                    and went to St. Thomas in the Danish West Indies. There is some inconsistency as to when the British
                    government seized the Laird rams; Winks gives the date incorrectly on page 125, correctly on page
                    358. Lincoln's renomination is wrongly assigned to May, 1864. Many readers will question
                    the relative importance that Winks assigns the <hi rend="i">Trent</hi> affair and the St. Albans
                    raid (in which Confederates from <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> attacked a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName> town). His emphasis on the raid as a possible cause of war with Britain is not
                    convincing.</p>
            <p>But it is difficult to write a book and easy to find fault with one. In many ways the present volume,
                    despite the above comments, is a noteworthy effort in a neglected field. Winks has written a good
                    book, but one that easily could have been improved by careful editing. Its failings are minor, its
                    conclusions fresh and helpful to students of the Civil War years.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Real Abraham Lincoln: A Complete One Volume History of His Life and Times.</hi>
                    By Reinhard H. Luthin. (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1960. Pp. xviii, 778.
                    Bibliographical note, notes, index. $10.00.)</head>
            <p>In spite of its presumptuous title, this biography deserves the careful scrutiny of amateur and
                    professional historian alike. Laymen will enjoy its rich detail, its fresh anecdotes, its many apt
                    quotations from Lincoln's speech and writing. Professional historians will be impressed by
                    its confident generalizations based upon exhaustive research.</p>
            <p>Professor Luthin portrays the Great Emancipator "wart and all." Organizing his
                    material topically as well as chronologically, he presents enlightening chapters and new evidence on
                    Lincoln's backwoods beginnings, his legal career, his political fortune and misfortune, his
                    domestic life in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, his personality, his lieutenants, his conduct of the war, his plans for reunion, and
                    his assassin.</p>
            <p>Lincoln's legal career is treated in more detail than one finds in most one-volume
                    biographies, and the reader gets new insight into Lincoln's relationships with his
                    partners, John T. Stuart, Stephen T. Logan, and William H. Herndon, and into his remarkable ability
                    to influence human behavior. Some no doubt will be surprised to learn that Lincoln once defended a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> slaveholder in a <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi> case involving a jailed Negro.</p>
            <p>Although less sympathetic to Mary Lincoln than the account of Ruth Painter Randall, <hi rend="i">The
                        Real Abraham Lincoln</hi> describes Lincoln's home life factually and realistically.
                    From the narrative, one appreciates the difficult role of a circuit-riding lawyer's wife.
                    "I hope," Mary wrote to a friend, "you may never feel as lonely as I
                    sometimes do, surrounded by much that renders life desirable" (p. 133).</p>
            <p>In dealing with controversial questions of interpretation, Professor Luthin meticulously marshals the
                    evidence and allows the reader to judge for himself. He relies heavily on quoted material, the
                    well-selected observations of Lincoln and his contemporaries. Seventy-six pages of helpful notes and
                    bibliography testify to his thorough canvass of available sources.</p>
            <p>An inspired selection of materials helps to conceal the fact that the author lacks the stylistic
                    excellence of Lord Charnwood or of Benjamin Thomas. Occasionally the writing is repetitious;
                    sometimes it needs greater coherence. At least once, it is misleading. In discussing
                    Lincoln's silence from November, 1860, until March, 1861, Luthin concludes that
                    "most of the South's leaders… did not realize how moderate a man
                    Lincoln actually was; nor did influential Southern leaders fully understand that the new
                    President… was sympathetic to their cause" (p. 266).</p>
            <p>Reinhard Luthin has nevertheless produced a lively biography, certainly the most detailed one-volume
                    account of the Sixteenth President.</p>

            <p>David Davis entered the mainstream of American history on three important occasions. In 1860, he
                    played a crucial, even indispensable, role in the nomination of Abraham Lincoln for the presidency;
                    in 1866, as a Supreme Court justice, he delivered the majority opinion in the case of <hi rend="i">Ex parte Milligan;</hi> and in 1877, he refused to serve on the electoral commission to
                    investigate the disputed Tilden-Hayes contest, a refusal that was interpreted by many to be the
                    cause of Tilden's defeat and Hayes's election (Davis had privately expressed his
                    belief that Hayes was entitled to the election). These three episodes marked the high points of a
                    long career of service to his home state and to his country, as circuit judge in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, on the Supreme Bench of the nation, and in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate, where he was chosen to preside when Vice-President Arthur assumed the
                    presidency.</p>
            <p>For Willard King, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> lawyer and author of an earlier successful biography of Chief Justice Melville Weston
                    Fuller, Davis' greatest contribution to American history was the part he played in
                    Lincoln's nomination. Davis and Lincoln were lifelong friends, and a large portion of this
                    book is a history of that friendship. That King regards Davis' relationship with Lincoln as
                    strong reason for this biography is clear, not only from the heavy emphasis on Lincoln in its pages
                    but also from the title. Davis was "Lincoln's Manager" for only a few
                    months out of a very long and full career. Those few months, to be sure, fixed Davis'
                    future, for his appointment to the Supreme Court in 1862 was a direct result of his close relation
                    with Lincoln. But Davis was too independent in his opinions and too honest and frank in their
                    expression to be considered an administration man on the court. He disagreed strongly with the
                    President on many basic questions: the use of patronage, the Emancipation Proclamation, and
                    especially on Lincoln's handling of civil liberties—a subject for which Davis
                    felt a deep and abiding concern. To place him too far in the dusk of Lincoln's shadow is to
                    deprive Davis of a greatness that is justifiably his own. While his management of Lincoln's
                    campaign in 1860 brought Davis wide notice, it is also true that Lincoln might not have been
                    nominated and elected had it not been for Davis' exertions. Davis' stature and
                    reputation continued to grow after Lincoln's death. His decision in the Milligan case (a
                    case he maneuvered to the Supreme Court) was truly, in the author's words, a
                    "great contribution to constitutional law" (p. 312).</p>
            <p>Davis was a true conservative; he could not abide radicalism before, during, or after the Civil War.
                    A native of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>, he grew up disliking slavery and hating abolitionists. He represents the broad area of
                    middle western conservative opinion which took strong exception to the program of the Republican
                    radicals and to many of President Lincoln's wartime decisions. He was one of several close
                    friends of Lincoln who opposed the President's concessions to the radical group in the
                    party.</p>
            <p>King has based his book on a wide and intimate knowledge of primary sources, especially the
                    voluminous Davis collection of manuscripts. Some might argue with the author's frequent
                    quotation from <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-057-2-075"/> Davis' letters, but in most cases these
                    impart a contemporaneous flair to his narrative. The author is persuasive in his treatment of
                    Davis' role in the 1860 campaign and in the disputed contest of 1876, and the light he
                    casts on these episodes will be of value to the historians who will treat them hereafter. His
                    discussion, for example, of the circumstances surrounding the appointment of Indiana's
                    Caleb Smith to Lincoln's cabinet, an appointment which Davis regarded as a "great
                    mistake," is illuminating and definitive. This is a first-rate biography.</p>

            <p>"Dawn, September 1, 1939.</p>
            <p>"There was no declaration of war. Across the western borders of <placeName>
                        <country reg="pl">Poland</country>
                    </placeName> poured the first waves of Hitler's mighty war machine." This is the
                    opening of Professor Snyder's swiftly moving, very readable history of World War II. In a
                    subsequent treaty with Soviet Russia, Hitler divided the spoils. "The agonies of hell now
                    descended upon the hapless Poles, prostrate before the conquerors. In a single month <placeName>
                        <country reg="pl">Poland</country>
                    </placeName> had been crushed in one of the speediest campaigns in military history. Thus began the
                    terrible blood bath of World War II" (p. 9). In five pages the author thus gives a dramatic
                    account of the war in <placeName>
                        <country reg="pl">Poland</country>
                    </placeName>. Then he goes back to give forty-three pages to what are the usual historical
                    introductions to World War II: underlying causes after World War I; crises in Asia, Africa, and
                    Europe, 1931–1938; immediate causes, 1939. Oftentimes the writer uses this flash-back
                    approach.</p>
            <p>He also plays frequently with one-sentence paragraphs. <hi rend="i">Sitzkrieg,</hi> Sit-down War,
                    Bore War, War of Words, Phony War." That is the opening paragraph of the fifteen-page
                    chapter on the collapse of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. "All <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> degenerated into panic, terror, hysteria, confusion" (p. 99). There is a
                    paragraph which tells what happened. "The entire proceedings took exactly 27
                    minutes" (p. 107). <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> had signed the armistice on June 21, 1940. Take another example, a paragraph of one
                    sentence. "It was 8:10 a.m., Hawaiian time, 1:40 p.m., Eastern Standard time, Sunday,
                    December 7, 1941." Then a new paragraph begins: "A young boy was scooting along on
                    his bike from Honolulu to Pearl Harbor.… carrying an urgent communication from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>" (p. 195). Then in the next thirty-four pages are sketched background and a
                    description of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName>'s progress throughout the Far East to the Battle of the <geogName>Coral
                    Sea</geogName> in May 9, 1942, when another one-sentence paragraph closes the account. "The
                    Battle of the <geogName>Coral Sea</geogName> was the Japanese high-water mark" (p. 227).</p>
            <p>Aside from the author's dramatic account of the war, the book's value is further
                    enhanced by thirty-two pages containing sixty-four generally well-chosen pictures, ranging from
                    Chamberlain at <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Strange to say, though many are available, there are no pictures of the Russian
                    fronts. The terribleness of the war for Russia is well described by the author. By December, 1941, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> admitted the loss by death of 162,314 soldiers in Russia. Five pages are given to the
                    Stalingrad defense. "It was unadulterated slaughter. Thousands died each day. It became
                    impossible to bury the dead or even to count them" (p. 303). The Russians "lost
                    more men at the Stalingrad than the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> lost in combat in all theatres of the entire war. Stalingrad was one of the great
                    turning points not only of the war but of world history" (p. 307). But no pictures from
                    Russia!</p>
            <p>There is, however, a copy of General MacArthur's well-publicized "I Shall
                    Return" picture, showing him and others landing through the water while others look on
                    smiling. The landing at Leyte is well described. "This was invasion in force: 600 warships,
                    250,000 men, the U.S. Seventh and Third Fleets, the U.S. Sixth Army." Said General
                    MacArthur, "I have returned. By the grace of Almighty God our forces stand again on
                    Philippine soil.…" But the writer points out that "in the classrooms at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Annapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> it was attributed in large part… to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Navy" (p. 456). Six pages are given to the Battle for Leyte Gulf,
                    "the greatest sea engagement ever fought. Engaged were 166 American and approximately 70
                    Japanese warships, 1,280 American and 716 Japanese warplanes" (p. 457).</p>
            <p>Space does not permit much detail. The author aims to present the story of the war in concise form.
                    He does it well. He aims to eliminate much military detail in favor of a comprehensive picture of
                    broad military developments. The space allotted to the various campaigns indicates that he does this
                    well. On points where there are differences of opinion—Pearl Harbor, Battle of Leyte,
                    Hitler versus his generals in Russia, and so on—he seeks to give both sides of the
                    arguments and does well. He aims to make his story dramatic. His pictures of Rotterdam, battered <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Leningrad's defense, D-Day, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Nazi concentration camps,
                    and Mussolini's and Hitler's deaths reveal his ability to do so.</p>

                    explanation for the breakdown of the world order of his time? (2) In Roosevelt's view, what
                    were the implications of that breakdown for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>? (3) What kind of world order did Roosevelt want to replace the former order?</p>
            <p>Three short initial chapters deal with the first two questions; the remainder of the book discusses
                    Roosevelt's world order. In discussing <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-057-2-077"/> the collapse of
                    international order and its implications for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, Range adds little that is new. As major causes for rupture of peace Roosevelt saw the
                    failure of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to join the League, economic nationalism, governments unresponsive to problems of
                    modern society, evil leaders, the armaments race, decline in moral and spiritual fiber, and the
                    "peace at any price" theory of the thirties. His thinking on these matters is well
                    known.</p>
            <p>The President's ideas on a new world order did not differ much from the hopes of anyone who
                    desired world-wide peace and good will. The author believes that Roosevelt personified the ideas and
                    aspirations of a considerable portion of the American people. FDR was an optimist who believed that
                    the good neighbor concept would permeate the globe. The nations would recognize their
                    interdependence. The President had strong faith in democracy and freedom. In a world where evil
                    forces—mainly Fascist and Nazi—were eradicated and where colonialism would
                    gradually disappear, free people could make great progress. Roosevelt also envisaged a global New
                    Deal. Conservation, reclamation, economic planning would be steps toward a healthy world order. To
                    preserve the international system Roosevelt had an idea for a big power guardianship which would aim
                    not to dominate but to keep the peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Franklin D. Roosevelt's World Order</hi> is one of the "what might
                    have been" genre—not so much what might have been had Roosevelt lived, but what
                    might have been if all the Allies' postwar aims had been similar to those of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Obviously they were not. For this reason one may feel that there is something futile
                    in reading about what most of us desired but did not get. Of what importance is this recapitulation?
                    The reason that Range offers is that perhaps in the long run Roosevelt was right. If pursued long
                    enough, a good neighbor approach could possibly produce a good neighbor response from all except a
                    small group of incurables. The author's optimism is commendable—and we hope
                    correct—but it is not too comforting to think that the "small group of
                    incurables" may be nearly a billion strictly regimented people who never get an accurate
                    view of our good neighborliness.</p>
            <p>Willard Range has used extensively printed publications concerning Roosevelt and the people about
                    him. He has also used, but to a lesser extent, materials in the Roosevelt manuscripts at Hyde Park.
                    The book is amply footnoted; the placing of the notes at the back of the book makes reading them in
                    conjunction with the text a test of one's manual dexterity.</p>

            <p>This is the first volume of a new edition of Emerson's journals and notebooks which is
                    intended to be the "definitive" edition and, when completed, will comprise
                    approximately sixteen volumes. Older editions (published in 1914 and earlier) were prepared by
                    persons close to <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-057-2-078"/> Emerson and were designed to substantiate an
                    already preconceived image of the "Sage of Concord"; hence, the need for a new
                    edition—an edition to correct past editorial errors, omissions, and erroneous
                    interpretations. This volume covers the years 1819–1822, when Emerson (age 16 to 19) was
                    an undergraduate at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Included are five journals, four notebooks (one college theme book, two commonplace
                    books, one quotation book), and a catalog of volumes Emerson read between the years 1819 and 1824.
                    The editors' Introduction explains the plan of publication for this series, the editorial
                    method, and the nature of the entire manuscript collection (234 items in all).</p>
            <p>In the Foreword to this volume, there is a partial chronology (1803–1822) of
                    Emerson's life and a list of symbols and abbreviations used by the editors. In the middle
                    of the book, there are twelve photographs of original manuscript pages; a glance at these impresses
                    one with the very difficult task the editors have undertaken. Editorial and alphabetical title
                    lists, textual notes, and an excellent index comprise the last portion of this volume.</p>
            <p>Often the nature of the contents belies the titles of the manuscripts—e.g., the college
                    theme book not only contains the first drafts of themes but also drafts of essays and poems,
                    quotations, and miscellaneous notes. The actual contents reveal a young <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> student who read widely and who wanted to become a writer. These writings, done during
                    Emerson's apprenticeship, illustrate how he assembled his material and how he began to
                    practice the art of writing. Emerson confided his inner thoughts—trivial and
                    profound—to these pages, and he began to build systematically a storehouse of ideas and
                    quotations for future use. His comments range from the topics of nature, religion, philosophy, and
                    drama to professors and their lectures and the usefulness of history. For a young man who was about
                    to transcend into an orbit of individualistic and high thinking, it is comforting to know that he,
                    like many more mundane mortals, was occasionally aggrieved by bad weather conditions.</p>
            <p>Subsequent volumes will demonstrate precisely for scholars Emerson's mental and artistic
                    maturity, his role as philosopher of Romantic democracy, and his espousal of the
                    "Over-Soul" concept in the transcendentalist movement. The high quality of
                    editorial workmanship displayed in the first volume convinces this reviewer that every feasible step
                    was taken for this volume and will be taken for future volumes to reproduce Emerson's notes
                    as he first penned them.</p>

                    $6.00.)</head>
            <p>After years of neglect, Mark Twain, the professional lecturer, is having a revival. In 1943 William
                    Brigance omitted Twain from his <hi rend="i">History and Criticism of American Address</hi> on the
                    premise that he exerted little influence on the flow of history. To those who have listened to Hal
                    Holbrook or who have read Paul Fatout's recent study, <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-057-2-079"/>
                    Mr. Brigance's assumption will seem to slight the cultural significance of the humorist who
                    has moved so many for so long to laugh at their own limitations and absurdities.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fatout is primarily concerned with the reconstruction of the lecture circuit in the last half of
                    the nineteenth century and with the role which Twain played in it, from his first financial success
                    in 1866 with his Sandwich Islands performance to 1900 when he finally "made no more lecture
                    tours" or accepted "pay for talking."</p>
            <p>Under shrewd promoters like James Redpath, the once sophisticated lyceum became an immense network
                    (not unlike present-day mass media) with eastern, western, and northern circuits. The business
                    attracted an odd assortment of stars: Henry Ward Beecher, Robert Ingersoll, Anna Dickinson, Wendell
                    Phillips, Josh Billings, and Petroleum V. Naseby. This paradoxical troupe included moral uplifters,
                    free thought crusaders, rabid reformers, and crude entertainers. Twain called all of them, including
                    himself, "bandits" on a "public highway."</p>
            <p>With commendable thoroughness Mr. Fatout records the newspaper reactions to Twain's
                    performances, which varied from occasional blasts at his sacrilegious allusions, distortions of
                    fact, and indecent sorties to frequently favorable but seldom ecstatic reviews. Mr. Fatout states
                    that there is no clear evidence to support the contention that Twain was "ranked with the
                    select group of the most-highly paid" (p. 150).</p>
            <p>The author discounts the notion that Twain submitted to the ordeal of public performances solely for
                    the quick cash. He could never resist for long the pleasure he got from wrestling with a live
                    audience. Even in moods of fatigue and discouragement and while swearing he was going to retire, he
                    was busy revising lectures and analyzing audience reactions so that his next performance might be a
                    triumph.</p>
            <p>After the early eighties Mark Twain was one of the most popular after-dinner speakers in America, but
                    his reputation as a lecturer and public reader awaited the flood of recognition springing from his
                    world tour in 1895–1896. Although the fulfillment of his intention was shattered by the
                    death of Susy, his "hundred readings in fifty-three cities of five countries"
                    clinched Mark Twain's reputation "as the dean of American speakers" and
                    "the elder statesman of the platform" (p. 272).</p>
            <p>The only flaw in Mr. Fatout's book is that it ends but fails to conclude. Instead of a
                    thematic evaluation or an interpretation of the significance of the lecture circuit experience as it
                    affected Mark Twain's expression, the author slides to a stop on a biographical tangent. In
                    spite of this structural weakness, the work is substantially conceived and actively written. Those
                    interested in one of the world's most famous speakers will find <hi rend="i">Mark Twain on
                        the Lecture Circuit</hi> well worth reading.</p>

            <p>At first glance, the title of this volume appears to be merely descriptive, but after reading the
                    Foreword it takes on a special and <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-057-2-080"/> complex meaning. The author,
                    professor of history and folklore at Indiana University, commences his essay with a definition of
                    folklore. It is, he writes, "the oral traditions channeled across the centuries through
                    human mouths" (p. 2). He points out that folklore may refer to types of barns, quilts,
                    tales, songs, customs, rituals, and a variety of other phenomena. "The common
                    element" he sees in this variety is "tradition." He then states an
                    assumption upon which the entire book rests: "Since the
                    ar⋆⋆⋆e of tradition in a given culture may vary considerably from
                    country to country, it is only right that the study of folklore should follow the contours of a
                    particular civilization" (p. 2). This, in brief, is Dorson's theory of American
                    folklore, which he first presented before an audience of scholars in 1957. His book thus becomes an
                    extensive exposition of this idea.</p>
            <p>American folklore, the author writes, began to take form with the first colonist landings. Beliefs of
                    the Old World were grafted onto the environment of the New World. Colonial folklore centered on
                    themes of the land, savages, and the providence of God. With the coming of the eighteenth-century
                    Enlightenment, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> passed from general attention. The new turn that folklore took was
                    native—from "the odd grain of American character." Regional types, the
                    down-Easter, the crafty Yankee, the homespun southerner, and the expansive westerner, all developed.
                    Using subliterary sources, such as the <hi rend="i">Spirit of the Times,</hi> the author examines in
                    particular the development of folk humor, which, he asserts, decreased as sectional strife grew.
                    "But," he concludes, "the backwoods oral yarn found one final supreme
                    mode of expression during the Civil War holocaust, in the person of its central actor, Abraham
                    Lincoln" (p. 69).</p>
            <p>Mr. Dorson interrupts his chronological presentation at this point and shifts to some other aspects
                    of American folklore. He interprets the regional folk culture of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> Germans, the <geogName>Ozark hill</geogName> folk, Spanish New Mexicans, <placeName>

                    </placeName> Coast Yankees, all of whose traditions stand in contrast to American urban industrial
                    society. In an examination of immigrant folklore, he poses the question, "What happens to
                    the inherited traditions of European and Asiatic folk after they settle in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and learn a new language and new ways" (pp. 135–136). Drawing
                    mainly upon his own collection of lore from the Upper Penninsula of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, the author concludes that tradition among immigrants lasts longer than is commonly
                    supposed. He also explores Negro folklore, which he perhaps surprisingly treats separately from that
                    of other immigrants, and concludes that its African origins should be minimized. Folk heroes also
                    receive consideration. Using the term "fakelore" that he coined in 1949 in
                    connection with deliberately manufactured folk heroes like Paul Bunyan, the author develops in
                    contrast legendary heroes like Davy Crockett and Jesse James. Returning to his chronology the author
                    ends his essay with a brief chapter on modern folklore, in which he concludes, after an examination
                    of the folklore of city folk, college students, and G.I.'s, that mass culture is not
                    traditionless. "The idea that folklore is dying out is itself a kind of folklore"
                    (p. 278).</p>
            <p>Some readers will be disappointed because of gaps in the illustrative material from the wide spectrum
                    of folklore that the author draws upon; <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-057-2-081"/> and others will find
                    weaknesses in his case. Among the former is the almost complete exclusion of folk dance, art, and
                    crafts. Among the latter, three examples will suffice. It appears that the author raises some issues
                    that ought to be pursued further. One of these is the problem of maintenance of tradition by
                    immigrants. He probably dismisses too quickly the general implications of the studies of Marvin K.
                    Opler, who reaches a conclusion in his study of the Japanese and Nisei that varies from
                    Dorson's own. More collecting and interpreting in this area is needed before a firmly held
                    conclusion should be reached. Weaknesses also appear in the chapter on folk heroes. Dorson correctly
                    designates Paul Bunyan hero-tales as "fakelore." Are, however, many of the Davy
                    Crockett tales, which were in part the products of Whig politicians and propagandists, less
                    "manufactured" than those about Bunyan? In short, the useful term,
                    "fakelore," should be applied consistently. Also, why should the author exclude
                    the leading figures in our national experience about whom tradition has woven many tales, namely
                    George <placeName>

                    a folk hero be of local significance and then become legendary through oral word and sub-literary

                    of "tradition" as folklore if it is valid? These weaknesses, however, are minor in
                    view of Dorson's thesis.</p>
            <p>Professor Dorson demonstrates beyond much doubt his theory that American folklore, or at least many
                    of its aspects, follows the "contours" of American civilization. This is his great
                    achievement, for which we are grateful. Further, he uses his extensive collecting and interpreting
                    in the field of folklore skillfully and easily, making this book both a good introduction to
                    American folklore for the beginner and a stimulating interpretation for the scholar.</p>

            <p>This book is largely the story of one member of a pioneer family of German descent which settled on
                    the untamed prairie near <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, in 1823, accumulated large land
                    holdings, established a well-known seed company, and has for years exerted energetic leadership in
                    scientific agriculture and in local, state, and national affairs. Its central figure, Eugene D.
                    Funk, Sr. (1867–1944), grew up during a period of rising land values and rapid
                    advancement in agriculture.</p>
            <p>In the auspicious first year of the present century, the Funk Brothers Seed Company was founded. Its
                    first concern was the production of better seed corn to fill a need generally felt at that time.
                    Much attention was given later, however, to other crop plants, such as alfalfa and soy beans, and to
                    the general improvement of agricultural practices.</p>
            <p>By the time that the groundwork was laid for the production of hybrid corn, the Funk Company had
                    established a reputation for producing good seed corn by the older methods of selection. Eugene Funk
                    had also reached the age at which he might have been content to rest <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-057-2-082"/> on his laurels and let a thriving business continue as it had been
                    going. But, having a vision of far better things to come from the new approach to corn breeding, he
                    saw to it that generous provision was made for continued research. The result has been a high level
                    of accomplishment in producing greatly increased yields, consistent uniformity, and resistance to
                    fungus diseases and insect pests. Funk's Research Acres, near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, has become a mecca for agronomists and plant breeders from all over the world.</p>
            <p>Funk was a leader in the planning and support of the corn fairs, corn schools, and national corn
                    expositions which left their unique mark on American farm life during the first fifteen years of the
                    century. He also took an active part in the founding of the American Seed Trade Association and
                    served as its president in 1925. Although basically opposed to interference with free enterprise, he
                    often served as consultant and aided in studies leading toward the regulation of prices and
                    production.</p>
            <p>A book which resulted from the assimilation of materials from the numerous diaries, journals, and
                    other documents to which the author had access could not be expected to be entirely free from error.
                    The corn plant may be called maize or <hi rend="i">Zea mays,</hi> but never <hi rend="i">Zea
                    Maize,</hi> as on p. 161. Errors in spelling are noted on pages 93 (Kjeldahl), 396 (Gibberella,
                    Pythium), and 536 (corn borer). The description of Nilsson-Ehle's work (p. 83) would lead
                    the reader to believe that he was working with corn. It was probably wheat or some other small
                    cereal. Nowhere in the book do we find a clear, concise account of the exact steps by which hybrid
                    seed corn is produced or of the theory underlying the process. These and other amateurisms lead to
                    the impression that the author has not succeeded in getting very close to the scientific aspects of
                    the subject.</p>
            <p>The main fault that we find with the book is the failure to assimilate the voluminous details. What
                    might have been a moving story of a great man and a fascinating era has remained too much a
                    tabulation of unadorned facts, with little to indicate their relative values. Even the reader who is
                    pretty well acquainted with the subject often finds himself floundering in a mire of details which
                    do not lead anywhere. This makes dull reading. The book will serve as a valuable reference work,
                    but, if there was hope that it might be widely read, this could have been much better accomplished
                    by stripping away two-thirds of the detail and then weaving the remainder into a smoothly flowing
                    narrative.</p>

            <p>Possibly the reviewer found the book of more interest than the casual reader might because of
                    numerous relatives who lived in or near the area that was dissected. As a former supervisor and
                    member of a board of tax review in another state, he was less interested in the feuds between the
                    settlers and the speculators, the rise and fall of the cattle kings, and the struggles to deal wih
                    such perennial problems as fencing, drainage, and farm tenancy than he was with taxation, the
                    subject covered in the final chapter.</p>
            <p>Far too little attention has been paid even by the economic historians to the assessment of real and
                    personal property, which formed the principal source of governmental income in the nineteenth
                    century. (To this day the average citizen only casually understands handling of delinquent taxes,
                    let alone the more complicated matters of appealing apparent tax inequities and the need for
                    equalization of assessment on a county and state basis.) Mrs. Bogue reviews legislative efforts to
                    deal with these problems—problems complicated by some of the unusual features of the
                    charter given to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Central Railroad. Not only were its taxes limited to 7 per cent of it gross annual
                    earnings, to be paid into the state treasury, but local levies could not be made on land grants
                    until purchasers <hi rend="i">completed</hi> payments and secured deeds from the company, a process
                    carried on in a most leisurely fashion—at least from the viewpoint of those whose lands
                    carried the full burden of local property taxes. Hence, governmental services suffered, as was
                    evidenced by the poor roads and the underpaid school teachers. The author concludes that the higher
                    taxes of the third quarter of the century encouraged large owners to dispose of unimproved land and
                    to rely heavily upon tenant operators. All landowners tended to intensify the raising of corn and
                    oats rather than devoting land to pasture.</p>
            <p>The author has done a tremendous amount of research which has included the usual government records,
                    newspapers, monographs, and county histories, as well as the personal papers of large landowners
                    such as Matthew T. Scott and loan agents such as Addison Goodell. Since this book is by and large a
                    statistical study, the writing can scarcely be sprightly. Nevertheless, it might have been improved
                    by reducing the length of quotations such as the ones which constitute the major portion of pages
                    37, 63, and 177, to cite the most glaring examples. Possibly some of the charts and tables might
                    have better been included in the Appendix. In contrast to the traditional thanks paid by a historian
                    to his wife, the author here reverses the tables and includes her husband among those to whom she is
                    in debt, the latter being Dr. Allen G. Bogue, chairman of the Department of History at the State
                    University of <placeName>

            <p>The Agricultural Extension Service and the Farm Bureau both had their inception in the last half of
                    the decade of the 1910's and for many years followed parallel paths. In some states their
                    mutual relationship was established by law, in others by custom, and in still others the two
                    agencies cooperated informally but usually rather effectively.</p>
            <p>This book traces in considerable detail the struggle to effect official separation of the
                    Agricultural Extension Service and the Farm Bureau at the national, state, and local levels. The
                    author very effectively relates the pressure for separation to the rising struggle for power among
                    various agricultural leaders and the different farm organizations in an effort to influence the
                    growing network of governmental participation in agriculture.</p>
            <p>In the early part of this century, some of the land grant agricultural colleges had been doing
                    informal adult educational work with farmers which soon came to be known as extension work. With the
                    advent of World War I, extension service employees, both in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and in the field, recognized that they could do their educational job most effectively
                    when "farmer-students" were organized in definite local associations. These local
                    associations came to be called "farm bureaus." Thus the Farm Bureau started, in
                    most instances, as a purely educational arm of the infant Agricultural Extension Service.</p>
            <p>It was inevitable that the county organizations would federate into state organizations, which was
                    precisely what happened in many states. The next step, of course, was national federation. This came
                    in November, 1919, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, when the temporary organization was named "American Farm Bureau
                    Federation."</p>
            <p>By 1939, when this study begins, some fifteen states had formal sponsorship of county extension
                    programs through the Farm Bureau, either by legal action or by administrative agreement. Financial
                    contribution to agricultural extension work made by the Farm Bureau in those states totaled almost
                    $1,000,000 in fiscal 1939.</p>
            <p>In the latter part of the 1930's the national farm organizations began to go their separate
                    ways with respect to support of or opposition to important federal farm programs emanating from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In general, the Farm Bureau strongly favored decentralization of farm programs, with a
                    maximum amount of local control and direction. This policy was natural, since that agency's
                    major organizational strength lay in the counties and the states. The Farmers Union, on the other
                    hand, increasingly favored centralization in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> of administrative control over major farm programs. The National Grange lined up on
                    either side from issue to issue, but frequently took the side of central administration. This
                    developing situation gave added emphasis to the long-time campaign of the Farmers Union, and to a
                    lesser extent to that of the National Grange, to obtain official separation of <pb n="179" id="VAA4025-057-2-085"/> the Agricultural Extension Service and the Farm Bureau, especially at
                    the county and state levels.</p>
            <p>During the administration of Secretary of Agriculture Anderson from 1944 to 1948, attempts at
                    separation subsided markedly, at least partly because the Farm Bureau and Secretary Anderson were
                    relatively close to each other on matters affecting national agricultural policy. With the
                    appointment of Secretary Brannan in 1948, however, battle lines formed again. The Farm Bureau, from
                    a national point of view, became increasingly vulnerable to criticism because of its close
                    association with a tax supported educational program while taking such a vigorous stand relative to
                    national agricultural policy on the other hand.</p>
            <p>Secretary Brannan, who was perhaps more vigorously opposed by the Farm Bureau than any other
                    secretary of agriculture, did not himself see fit to issue an order forcing dissolution of official
                    ties that still existed in a few states. It remained for Secretary Benson to do this by executive
                    memorandum in the fall of 1954. But his time, official separation of the Agricultural Extension
                    Service from the Farm Bureau was supported publically by the federal extension director, the Land
                    Grant College Association, most of the state extension directors, a great majority of the state farm
                    bureaus, and, tacitly at least, by the American Farm Bureau Federation itself.</p>
            <p>There is no concrete evidence that dissolution of the official ties between Extension and Farm Bureau
                    enhanced the membership of either the National Grange or the Farmers Union or that it injured the
                    membership of the American Farm Bureau Federation.</p>
            <p>This book is strongly recommended for students of agricultural policy and for students of the
                    relationships among the agricultural pressure groups, the general farm organizations, and the
                    development of agricultural programs. In this sense the struggle for separation of Farm Bureau and
                    the Agricultural Extension Service is incidental, as indeed I believe it to be, to the broader and
                    more fundamental question of the kind of general relationship that exists between government and
                    agriculture.</p>

                    book is a welcome addition to the rather short list of works bearing upon the subject. As the title
                    indicates, it is a collection of readings. These are divided into eight parts, the division being
                    made largely on the basis of chronology. That is, the book starts with earliest colonial times and
                    comes down to the present. Attention is given to technology, public policy, national emergencies,
                    and other significant aspects of the development of agriculture.</p>
            <pb n="180" id="VAA4025-057-2-086"/>
            <p>Parts I and II cover the period from 1607 to 1789. The contributions of the Indians to the
                    agriculture which was transplanted by settlers from Europe are treated at some length in Part I.
                    Part II deals with early national land policy and the beginnings of technological progress in
                    agriculture in this country.</p>
            <p>In Part III, which covers the period from 1789 to 1861, the editor presents materials dealing with
                    further technological progress and the beginnings of agricultural cooperative marketing. This period
                    saw the introduction of the mechanical reaper, the steel plow, commercial fertilizers, and improved
                    breeds of livestock.</p>
            <p>Part IV covers the period from 1861 to 1914 and is headed "The First American Agricultural
                    Revolution." Its main theme is rapid technological progress in American agriculture, with
                    some attention to public land policy and the rise of farmers' organizations.</p>
            <p>Parts V, VI, and VII deal with World War I and its aftermath with respect to American agriculture.
                    Part V is short, covering only the years from 1914 to 1919. Part VI deals with the chronic
                    agricultural depression extending from 1920 to 1932 and is concerned mainly with political efforts
                    at farm relief. Part VII has to do with the New Deal era of the 1930's, and the materials
                    are about equally divided between public policy with respect to agriculture and further
                    technological progress.</p>
            <p>Part VIII is headed "World War II and the Second Agricultural Revolution." It is
                    regrettably short and considerably inadequate.</p>
            <p>The book has numerous illustrations which are quite good, and the sections on chronology and
                    recommended readings are useful. Although the work as a whole deserves a good rating, it has some
                    serious deficiencies. For example, there is virtually nothing about the Populist movement in it, and
                    the whole subject of farmers' movements is dealt with very scantily. The farmers'
                    role in politics in this country has been much more important than these readings would indicate.
                    The book could well have been considerably longer than it is.</p>

            <p>This book tells of the American civil engineer's rise toward professionalism. When agitation
                    for internal improvements began early in the nineteenth century, the few native technologists were
                    chiefly homespun products of experience on surveying crews; in 1816 there were only about thirty in
                    the whole country.</p>

                    </placeName>, and others. The author says that when directors of internal improvements
                    "created or found a supply of engineers, every step they took to assure that supply helped
                    to fix the civil engineer as a separate occupational type in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>" (p. 54).</p>
            <p>Still, the civil engineer did not achieve status overnight, often being ambiguously involved on
                    public projects in a position quasi-contractual or directorial, sometimes merely advisory, and
                    frequently embroiled in state and local politics. In 1867, the founding of the American Society of
                    Civil Engineers was a long step toward the professionalism the civil engineer enjoys today. Yet the
                    author concludes that nineteenth-century experience made the engineer not an independent entity but,
                    rather, dependent upon "a corporate America that supported the engineer, sustained the
                    engineer, and quite early defined his character" (p. 199).</p>
            <p>The author uses many details to illuminate adventures of such engineers as Benjamin Wright, Nathan
                    Roberts, Jesse L. Williams, Benjamin H. Latrobe, and others, and reveals problems, engineering and
                    human, in the building of the Erie Canal, Chesapeake and <geogName>Delaware Canal</geogName>, <placeName>

                    </placeName> Railroad, and so forth. In this volume, a great quantity of information rests on
                    copious documentation. Yet the piling up of minutiae about political and technological squabbles
                    makes hard reading, chiefly because a pedestrian style does little more than list a catalog of
                    facts. The writing calls for lift and flair. The numerous engineers, commissioners, and politicians
                    who populate these pages emerge not as living human beings but only as automatons with names; a bald
                    recital misses the drama that must have attended those ambitious construction jobs. Trite words like
                    "case," "type," "the fact that,"
                    "field," "area," "participated" make the prose
                    flat. The assembly of plentiful data merits approval for the workmanlike industry it shows, but
                    unfortunately the narration plods with heavy foot.</p>

            <p>It is remarkable that in America, despite the great natural resources and inventive genius of private
                    enterprisers, both of which are conspicuous in the steel industry, workers in the mills from
                    1870's until World War I lived a life close to slavery—with subsistence wages,
                    long hours of work, continual exposure to danger of death and injury, and a condition of servility.
                    How was this possible? Besides describing the workers' conditions, David Brody has studied
                    the economic and social forces affecting the iron and steel industry up to 1929 and offers a
                    reasoned and well-documented answer. His findings do not reflect <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-057-2-088"/> favorably on either the businessmen or the union leaders of this sixty-year period.</p>
            <p>Brody describes, first, the economic characteristics of the industry. From 1870 to 1900 unrestricted
                    competition bred overriding concern for <hi rend="i">economy.</hi> Economy brought rapid
                    technological progress, cost accounting, and technical efficiency in production. The economy of
                    Carnegie and other enterprisers included the exploitation of both engineers and
                    workmen—labor was "a commodity like anything else."</p>
            <p>The labor union to which the American Federation of Labor granted exclusive jurisdiction was the
                    Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers, limited to skilled workmen. It reached a total of
                    twenty-four thousand members at its peak in 1891. The union never faced up to the results of
                    mechanization, neither saving its own members from displacement nor attempting to organize the
                    increasing proportion of unskilled workers. By 1914 it had only sixty-five hundred members.</p>
            <p>Management lured the English-speaking skilled workers away from unionism through promotion and
                    paternalism. It was the large flow of unskilled workers from eastern Europe that kept wages
                    down— ⋆⋆⋆a continually shifting group, since many
                    returned home with hard-earned savings. Southern Negroes and Mexicans played the same role in the
                    1920's. The companies dominated the steel communities. Following a ruthless antiunion
                    policy, they placed paid spies in union meetings; workers dared not even talk among themselves about
                    their grievances.</p>
            <p>The author also discusses the labor policy of U.S. Steel, the special situation in World War I, and
                    the ill-fated AF of L organizing drive and strike of 1918–1919.</p>

            <p>This volume greatly enlarges our equipment for study of government and politics in Indiana during the
                    period of the first constitution. There are 390 pages of electoral data (listing candidates for
                    offices and showing the vote received); an appendix citing acts creating the state's
                    counties and apportioning the state for Congress and general assembly. Seventeen pages of
                    introduction describe the state of Indiana's electoral records, explain how the information
                    in this volume was obtained, outline the electoral law and procedures, and relate the popularly
                    chosen officials to the total structure of government under the first constitution. And finally,
                    there is an index which shows for every person named in the book every office that he sought, the
                    year he stood for election, and whether he won or lost. Naturally it is not possible to know how
                    patiently the editors sought reliable data for the <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-057-2-089"/> last item,
                    nor how carefully proofreading was done; on the evidence available, this reviewer would say that
                    Dorothy Riker and Gayle Thornbrough did a truly admirable job.</p>
            <p>This volume is helpfully supplemented by nearly a hundred pages of tabulations compiled by Robert J.
                    Pitchell, titled <hi rend="i">Indiana Votes,</hi> and published in 1960 by the Indiana University
                    Bureau of Government Research. The Pitchell volume encompasses all elections for governor from 1852
                    to 1956 and all elections for <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator from 1914 to 1958. The tabulations show the following information by county:
                    vote for each candidate of the two leading parties, combined vote for all other candidates, the
                    percentage of the total vote and the percentage of the two-party vote which went to each major party
                    candidate. The vote for minor party candidates is omitted.</p>
            <p>The electoral data for 1816 to 1851 is presented in five sections of the book under review. The
                    sections pertain to: presidential electors, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> House of Representatives and Senate, governor and lieutenant governor, both chambers of
                    the general assembly, and constitutional issues (referenda on calling a convention, election of
                    delegates to the convention of 1850, and ratification of the constitution of 1851). To the extent
                    that the information could be obtained, the full names of all candidates and the vote for each
                    candidate, by counties, are given. Notably missing are names of unsuccessful candidates and the
                    county vote for members of the general assembly in elections prior to 1844, the vote by counties for
                    other offices in the 1816 election, and the vote for several seats in the 1850 constitutional
                    convention. <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senators were chosen by the state legislature throughout the period, and presidential
                    electors were selected in the same way in 1816 and 1820. The vote given to each candidate for
                    senator, in successive ballots, is shown, and there are notes on the two legislative selections of
                    electors, but the division of state legislators among the candidates for senator and for
                    presidential elector is not shown. Footnotes interspersed throughout the returns indicate sources of
                    information, note discrepancies in information, and supply other useful knowledge.</p>
            <p>The index shows for each individual every office he sought, the year he stood, and whether he was
                    successful and therefore makes quick and easy a number of interesting little studies. For instance,
                    the reviewer finds that under the first constitution, the office of lieutenant governor was not a
                    step to the governorship as it is today. Only three men who served as lieutenant governor later
                    sought the higher office; two were elected, one was defeated. A fourth lieutenant governor later
                    served in the national House of Representatives; none of the others subsequently held an office
                    higher than the state legislature. The first two governors of Indiana (Jennings and Hendricks,
                    together serving three terms) had not previously served in the general assembly; every later
                    governor under the first constitution had seen service in that body. A check of a sample of two
                    hundred men, selected by chance, who stood for office other than the 1850 convention shows that 105
                    served in the general assembly, two of whom were also elected to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> House of Representatives; the other 95 never <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-057-2-090"/> won
                    an election. Of the latter group, two men each tried one time for presidential elector but did not
                    make it. At least, they won a memorial in this book which will outlast a crumbling cemetery
                    headstone.</p>

            <p>The literature on state and local taxation multiplies in direct proportion to the demands upon state
                    and local governments for money to meet the growing needs of an expanding population. Professor
                    Fisher's work is a broadly and ambitiously conceived study of the financial problems of the
                    state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, although the author limits his analysis to an economic framework. The politics of
                    taxation, which normally dominate the formation of fiscal policy, are not dealt with at all.</p>
            <p>The value of this work is that it brings together in well-organized form a great deal of useful data
                    which are available in standard reference works and official governmental reports. It is regrettable
                    that Professor Fisher has made no attempt at original research in the field, some of
                    which—on such topics as business and corporate tax burdens—is indispensable
                    for an adequate analysis of the subject.</p>
            <p>This failure contributes to the major weakness of the study. The author shows rather easily that the
                    most relevant economic criteria prove that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> taxpayers are well off in comparison to those of other states. He runs into much more
                    difficult and unresolved problems when his analysis turns to the distribution of the tax burden
                    among the various groups within the state. For example, business firms admittedly pay substantial
                    sales taxes on the goods they consume in their operations, but Fisher makes no effort to estimate
                    this burden in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. ⋆⋆⋆In the field of property taxation, the author
                    makes the elementary error of using assessment figures to measure tax burden among classes of
                    property taxpayers (except farmers) and compounds the error by failing to recognize that in most
                    states a significant proportion of personal property taxes are paid by business firms. The author
                    admits that "the data presented in this section are far too fragmentary to permit a
                    numerical estimate of the percentage of state and local taxes in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> which is paid by business." He goes on to conclude— improperly, I
                    believe—that "they are sufficient, however, to indicate clearly that taxation of
                    business is significantly lighter in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> than in most states" (p. 115).</p>
            <p>As useful as the material in this volume is, a greater contribution would have been made if more
                    effort had been expended on compiling tax burden data which are not available in standard sources.</p>
