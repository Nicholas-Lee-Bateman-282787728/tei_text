                    </placeName>, deep in the virgin forests of central North America, the placid, winding White River
                    slowly drained ancient woodlands. In these dense forests, river valleys like this one had made homes
                    for fur-bearing animals and for people who hunted them, time out of mind. Here, about 1800, the
                    Delaware Indians were establishing new homes. They had been pushed out of Ohio by the relentless
                    advance of American white settlers. A century of resistance had ended in disaster. Now they were
                    well inside the region that was protected "forever" as Indian country by a treaty
                    with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and they hoped for peace through accommodation. The Delawares were a people not easily
                    moved from the land of their fathers, but the country they entered was superficially like that they
                    had left. Along the White River they found natural prairies—treeless floodplains that
                    broke the beech and maple canopy with brilliant patches of sunlight — which made
                    excellent sites for villages of farming women and hunting men. At least here they could resettle
                    themselves far from the press of American pioneers.</p>
            <p>In the autumn of 1800 the Delawares welcomed into their midst William Conner and his brother John,

                    modern society. The Delawares trusted the Conners as friends. They were not yet fully aware that the
                    very presence of white traders guaranteed once more the destruction of Indian peace, for the Conners
                    were servants of a commercial advance that thrust outward from frontier centers and brought the
                    "wilderness" within the system of American enterprise, and eventual conquest, long
                    before the arrival of farming pioneers.</p>

                    habitual to generations of Americans of European descent. The process had always begun with
                    adventurers, traders, and missionaries mingling among the natives in their own
                    "primitive" world. These first intruders carried powerful features of expansive
                    European culture into the wilderness; chief among these alien forces was dynamic commercial
                    capitalism. Since the first purchases of corn, made at gunpoint in seventeenth-century <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jamestown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, trade with American Indians had been unequal and often involuntary. By the nineteenth
                    century the permanence of white Americans and their aggressive culture had routinized the
                    exploitation. In the national period the early pioneers, agents of a new American empire, brought
                    the Indians more peacefully into dependency on white society's trade goods, its markets for
                    furs and forest products, and its mysterious credit systems.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the colonial period British policy had been aimed at restricting intrusion on the
                    Indians' domain. American independence, however, loosed a vigorous new nation whose
                    ambitions would not be checked. As federal policy took shape in the early nineteenth century, Indian
                    removal quickly proved to be the only suitable response to white pressures for land and space. The
                    commercial penetration of Indian society led, not to permanent coexistence (as the British had once
                    hoped) but to further colonial expansion: the interaction of white traders with Indian communities
                    undermined the independent structures of native culture while erecting new structures of trade and
                    enterprise that made life in the wilderness possible for white pioneers. With the final <list type="footnotes">

                    themselves corrupted and inextricably linked to the white man's systems.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> It is in this larger process of expansion and subjugation that the
                    frontierspeople—men and women—found their historical importance. True, they
                    were often heroic individuals who struggled with harsh conditions and succeeded through
                    extraordinary personal exertion, but they were also agents of the advancing empire, outriders for an
                    expansive culture. They carried the instruments of empire forward, deep into Indian country. Some
                    were Christian missionaries, more were agents of trading companies, while a few were simply
                    misanthropic adventurers. All were engaged, however, in pushing back the American frontier.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>William Conner was one of these agents of empire, and his story reveals with unusual clarity the
                    central role of enterprise as the primary constant in a frontier life that offered wrenching
                    changes. While his individual contribution was not grand, his role in a larger network of traders
                    and intruders illustrates the actual dynamics of frontier advance. Conner was born on the late
                    colonial frontier, the son of an earlier commercial pioneer. He grew up in communities of Christian
                    Indians led by Moravian missionaries; he took to commerce with the Indians as his natural
                    occupation; and he settled eventually among the Delawares of the Indiana Territory. For nearly
                    twenty years Conner lived with the Delawares, keeping house and making a family, trading white
                    man's goods for furs and skins, yet all the while serving as an agent of the eventual
                    removal of his Indian hosts. When that day came, Conner's Delaware wife and children
                    departed with the tribe; William stayed in Indiana, exploiting his considerable wealth and
                    invaluable head start to become a natural leader in the new white community. Another twenty years
                    saw the completion of that dramatic process of community building for which the frontier is justly
                    famous. Only then did William Conner retire from his place at the center of his fast-growing local
                    community.</p>

            <p>William was not the first pioneer Conner, for in many ways his life paralleled that of his father,
                    Richard. The elder Conner was born in 1718 in colonial <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>. As a young man in his twenties Richard Conner entered the Pennsylvania wilderness in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lancaster County</region>
                    </placeName>, possibly engaged in the fur trade. There he married Margaret Boyer, a young white
                    woman held captive since childhood by the Shawnee Indians. Conner ransomed his bride for two hundred
                    dollars and the promise to give their firstborn son to the tribe. Theirs was an Indian marriage
                    without Christian documentation, and the Conners continued to live among the Shawnees for several
                    years to come. Born in 1771, their first son, James, was delivered to the Indians. By 1773 Richard
                    and his wife were living in southeastern Ohio in a Shawnee and Delaware settlement known locally as
                        Connerstown.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to the Reverend David Jones, a Christian missionary traveling through the Indian country in
                    1773, Richard Conner kept a "sort of tavern" in a village otherwise composed of
                    Indian lodgings, some of them "good log houses well shingled with nails." Conner
                    seemed quite thoroughly established, and he indicated he was about to "proceed to
                    farming." Jones reported that Margaret Conner was a sister of the white wife of
                    "the chief Indian of this town," and he assumed that explained Conner's
                    presence in an alien place. He found Richard to be a tough man, one who seemed "not to fear
                    God" nor "regard man." In sum, Jones concluded that Conner was
                    "not what he should be, yet he was kind to me."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after Jones's visit, David Zeisberger, a leader of Moravian missions to the
                    Indians, spent an evening with the Conners. They talked "‘half the night about
                    salvation and all that is involved.’" It is impossible to tell what this
                    encounter might have had on young Margaret or her much older, hard-bitten husband, but events and
                    feeling conspired quickly to bring the Conners into a close and lasting alliance with Zeisberger and
                    his missions. When renewed warfare between Americans and the Shawnees drove the Conners from their
                    home, they resettled in February, 1775, at Zeisberger's mission in Schoenbrunn, <placeName>

            <p>The presence of the Conners at Schoenbrunn was extraordinary. Zeisberger's towns were
                    strictly reserved for Christian Indians and their ministers—a rule made absolutely
                    necessary by the interracial strife that plagued the region. Only rarely were whites permitted to
                    settle in Moravian towns, and few of these were invited to stay after a year of probationary
                    residence. But the worlds of David Zeisberger and Richard Conner and his sons intermingled for the
                    next thirty years. John Conner (1775) and William (1777) were born at Schoenbrunn and baptized into
                    the congregation. James Conner (1771), the firstborn son, was ransomed from the Shawnees and brought
                    there to live as well. Richard and Margaret participated in the life of the settlement apparently
                    without reservation, even moving with the Moravians from town to town. Still Richard's
                    position in the community was never clear. He seemed to be a farmer and a trader, and he may have
                    served as an interpreter. He did not become a preacher, but the Moravian missions somehow had become
                    Richard Conner's point of connection with the Indians of the territory northwest of the <placeName>

                    on a newer frontier. The Conner brothers received parcels of Michigan land from their father around
                    1796, but William would not yet be confined to the farm. At about age eighteen William Conner
                    settled in the Saginaw Bay region of Michigan and began to trade with the Indians. Little is known
                    of his whereabouts until the winter of 1800–1801, when he turned up exploring the central
                    forests of Indiana Territory.</p>
            <p>William Conner and his brother John apparently moved to Indiana as agents for Angus Mackintosh, a
                    Canadian fur dealer located at Sandwich, <placeName>

                    </placeName>. In October, 1800, they took up residence among the Delaware Indians along the west
                    fork of White River, where there was "a good appearance of a hunt… this
                    season." Mackintosh seemed pleased to have the Conners establish themselves in this area.
                    He urged John to watch the competition and to "run about among the Indian Camps"
                    as the other traders did. In January, 1801, Mackintosh reiterated his confidence in the Conners, but
                    by spring their business connection was dissolved. When Moravian missionaries resumed their ministry
                    to the Delawares in May, 1801, John and William were already settled among them. John resided in
                    Buckongahela's Town (see map on page 307); William possibly lived nearby in Chief
                    Anderson's village.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By November, 1801, the Conners were licensed to trade with the Indians at the Delaware towns along
                    the west fork of the White River. Their location was not accidental. They had explored the region
                    for perhaps a year, and they knew its potential for furs and trade. The presence of the Delawares
                    and their Moravian ministers simply reproduced the environment in which the boys had grown up. John
                    had already married a Delaware woman and adopted the Indian life. In 1802 William followed suit,
                    marrying Mekinges, the daughter of Chief William Anderson, and moving to a site twenty-five miles
                    downstream from her father's village. This would remain his home for thirty-five years.
                    Whatever it was that brought harmony and profit to this triple alliance of Moravians, Delawares, and
                    Conners was at work once more.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>In 1803 John Conner moved back toward civilization to the Whitewater Valley, just inside the frontier
                    of settlement. Now the commercial network was complete. William collected skins and pelts from the
                    interior Indian settlements and shipped them out to brother John, who sold the furs and supplied his
                    brother with the trade goods and whiskey required by his customers. The Conners frequently supplied
                    the Moravians as well. Finally, it was during this period that John Conner began serving as an
                    interpreter between the Delaware Indians and the rapidly encroaching American government.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conners appeared to have immersed themselves in the culture and lifestyle of their Indian
                    friends, but their very presence among the Delawares and their increasing role as liaisons to the
                    white society guaranteed the destruction of Indian civilization in the White River country. The
                    Indian trade was never an equal exchange. The fur trade placed powder and ball, iron tools,
                    blankets, decorative trinkets, and addictive whiskey into Indian hands. Dependency and corruption
                    inevitably resulted. Furthermore, the trade brought white people into Indian country and induced
                    further immigration. Regardless of their intentions (which cannot be verified) William Conner and
                    his brother undermined the fragile civilization which the Delawares had so recently transplanted to
                    White River. John Conner's relocation in 1803 to the Whitewater Valley—a white
                    settlement where federal restrictions on Indian trade did not extend—gave him an added
                    advantage in exploitative commerce. Straddling the line between two cultures, John now played an
                    active role in the final exploitation of the White River tribes. William's place, however
                    removed from the scene of the confrontation, was only superficially less disastrous to the
                    Indians' future.</p>
            <p>In the larger scheme of American history from 1800 to the War of 1812, a number of factors ensured
                    repeated conflict in the western territories. Land hunger and the accelerating migration of <placeName>

                    would produce two more by 1812. Thomas Jefferson's purchase of Louisiana in 1803 secured
                    forever the mouth of the Mississippi River, the natural outlet for interior travel and commerce. The

                    settlers, while it set aside the rest of the Northwest Territory as an Indian reservation. Far from
                    ending displacement, this treaty set the stage for future cessions and the steady removal of the
                    Indians from the trans-Appalachian region. Finally, the continued presence of the British in North
                    America, and their pragmatic alliance with Indians hostile to American immigration, lent an
                    international dimension to interior conflict.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>Resident whites in Indian country were essential participants in the process of Indian removal.
                    William Conner did not officially act as government servant until 1811, although his brother John
                    often served territorial governor William Henry Harrison in either a military or civilian capacity
                    after 1807. William did profit from the lucrative new business that accrued from negotiations with
                    local tribes for cessions of land in return for annuities, payment of debts, and travel supplies. It
                    was in response to intense pressure for land cessions from Governor Harrison that the Shawnee holy
                    man, The Prophet, began organizing resistance among the resident Indians. The Delawares maintained
                    their confidence in the Conners through these troubled years before the War of 1812, and they tried
                    desperately to stay out of hostilities. It is ironic that the Indians placed their faith in the men
                    who had sold them whiskey, aided their enemies, and brought such pressure to bear on their crumbling
                    freedom. On the other hand, their alternative was to follow The Prophet in an ill-starred resistance
                    that would surely fail and might yield no payment at all for their lands.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>

                    regular army service, he remained in the pay of the federal Indian agency as an interpreter for
                    treaty negotiations. Over the next several years eight treaties were signed at which William Conner
                    was present as an interpreter or witness. Each document ceded Indian lands to the whites and removed
                    the original owners to ever-smaller reservations or to the trans-Mississippi West.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Logically, men like William and John Conner might have feared the advance of the frontier, for with
                    the arrival of the immigrants came the end of the fur trade and the easy life of white men in Indian
                    society. Yet the Conners were increasingly active in the removal of Indians from central Indiana.
                    The reason can be seen in the roles they played, roles that plausibly connected their original
                    "agency" with the process of displacement that they now furthered. Although force
                    was often used and always threatened, persuasion was the preferred instrument of American Indian
                    removal. Government policy dictated almost endless rounds of negotiations resulting in treaties that
                    promised certain lands in exchange for others—at least until the next time. Like the
                    Indian trade itself, these negotiations were unequal exchanges: the language and the law were
                    strictly American. Interpreters to the Indians often held the key to federal success because they
                    alone could "persuade" the tribes to ratify the treaties. Furthermore, despite
                    federal regulations to prevent exploitation, resident traders had usually ensnared the Indians in
                    credit purchases that left them virtually "mortgaged" to their American suppliers.
                    When negotiations began for cessions of land or removal of tribes, Indian traders like the Conners,
                    who had lived among the natives, knew their languages, enjoyed their confidence, and carried large
                    debts in their behalf, were at once intermediaries and interested principals at the bargaining

                    Indians' military resistance; with the return of peace Indiana joined the Union in 1816.
                    Most of this new state was still legally Indian country, and the federal government immediately
                    moved to secure clear title to the whole area occupied by Delawares, Miamis, Potawatomis, and Weas.
                    Negotiations were extremely complicated. As Indiana Governor Jonathan Jennings explained in 1818 to
                    Secretary of War John C. Calhoun, the "claims of the several tribes … were so
                    interwoven by treaty and tradition" and such "clanish [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]
                    jealousies and suspicions" existed among the Indians, that the government was required to
                    strike a separate bargain with each tribe.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> The governor identified only half
                    the problem. Adding to the confusion were the needs and ambitions of white traders who held Indian
                    debts (often fraudulently padded), sought rich contracts for provisioning the departing tribes, and
                    demanded private reservations of land for friendly chiefs, mixed-bloods, and others who later could
                    be persuaded to sell these tracts to their "friends" for a few cents per acre. The
                    whole complicated issue was taken up at the general conclave held in 1818 at St. Mary's, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. It was here that William Conner helped his family and friends decide the terms of
                    their removal.</p>
            <p>Considering the complexity of the claims and the inevitability of removal for the White River
                    Delawares, Chief Anderson's confidence in his son-in-law William Conner was still the best
                    advantage he possessed. At the same time, it seems clear from fragmentary evidence that Conner
                    worked in close cooperation with Governor Jennings and the leading white politicians who were
                    guiding negotiations to a favorable end. On October 3, 1818, relatively early in the convention, the
                    government concluded an agreement with the Delawares. All Delaware claims to Indiana land were
                    extinguished at the end of three years' time. The Indians were promised land in
                    southwestern Missouri on the James Fork of another White River. The <placeName>

                    </placeName> pledged to pay fair value for improvements on the Delaware farms, to supply provisions
                    and transportation for the journey west, and to pay perpetual annuities to the Delaware people.
                    Given the narrow limits of possible debate, the bargain was probably a good one. It ensured an
                    orderly and planned removal while providing for rapid and steady immigration by impatient white
                        settlers.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>For William Conner the Treaty of St. Mary's marked a private crisis the dimensions of which
                    we cannot know. His dilemma was shared by every frontiersman who entered native society as a guest
                    and emerged as a conqueror. Private life and public action inexorably diverged; regardless of
                    personal motives, the crisis had to come. Conner's effective choices were two: he could go
                    with the Delawares and recreate his role as resident trader and American agent in their new Missouri
                    home; or he could remain on the White River and join in building a permanent white society. That
                    Mekinges might stay was probably ruled out by the unrelenting racism that would surely make her an
                    outcast in the eyes of the oncoming pioneers.</p>
            <p>The best clue to Conner's attitude toward Delaware removal lies in his decision to stay. He
                    might have gone with his family; his business partner William Marshall made that choice, but Conner
                    did not. Instead, like his father before him, he chose to exploit new opportunities as the frontier
                    caught and passed him. He probably profited from the Treaty of St. Mary's as a creditor and
                    as an interpreter, although evidence of his payments has not been found. In February, 1820, six
                    months before the Delawares left, Conner petitioned Congress for a grant of land "to remain
                    at the place" where he had been living "for the purpose of raising his family
                    (half breeds)." The petition was based on conventional appeals going back to a Wyandot
                    treaty in 1817, in which reservations of land were first allowed for the white husbands of Indian
                    women. Did he mean for Mekinges to stay? Was he belatedly seeking free land by false pretense for
                    his own enrichment? Or did he intend to share the value of that donation, as he reportedly did his
                    cash wealth, with Mekinges and the children at the time of their departure? It is impossible to know
                    because Conner's petition was tabled in the House. It was not until two years later that he
                    was given an imperfect title to his homestead in common with his now distant Indian wife and
                    heirs—a gesture that was worthless to him.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all, for Conner, the removal of the Delawares was probably an inevitability without moral
                    dimensions. He probably shared with his contemporaries those assumptions about race, culture, <list type="footnotes">

                    doomed to flee the advance of energetic white civilization. Eventually he came to articulate his
                    position among the Delawares as a benevolent visitor, a protector, and a friend. In 1829 in a
                    petition begging once more for clear title to the land around his White River farm, Conner explained
                    how "during the last war, before and since, he had lived among the Indians, and fed them
                    when they had not the means to do it; and at all times was engaged in preparing their minds for the
                    sale of their lands to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>." To remove any hint of personal exploitation Conner insisted that Mekinges
                    had gone west with her people "in spite of his persuasions that she should
                        remain."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> At least in public language, Conner had found that
                    exquisite ambivalence from which the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as a nation treated individual Indians with decorum, respect, and legal pretense, while
                    destroying their collective existence. In his own mind, he had lived sincerely among them, had
                    traded fairly with them, and had even secured for them the best possible bargain for their removal;
                    but he was a white man and a trader, not a member of Delaware society but an agent of the American
                    advance. As if to punctuate his choice, Conner married a white woman not three months after the
                    Delawares left. Without breaking stride the old frontiersman became a builder in a new community.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Chapman Conner was the seventeen-year-old step-daughter of a recent settler named John
                    Finch. In 1820, when William Conner proposed marriage, she was very possibly the only eligible woman
                    in residence among the handful of immigrants to the White River country. Conner's marriage
                    to Elizabeth proved that, despite his age (forty-four) and his long immersion in Delaware culture,
                    he intended to start life anew among his own people. The marriage forged an intimate link between
                    the recent settlers and the first pioneer, lending continuity to the process of frontier development
                    across two distinct phases. For two decades change had come rather slowly to Conner's
                    outpost on the river, but the frontier would vanish before the next score years had passed. Having
                    thrived on the passing of one civilization, Conner now sought his fortune in building up another.</p>
            <p>Much of William Conner's importance in the White River country derived from his early
                    residence. Until 1820 Conner's place was identified with a series of Delaware towns that

                    It was a place that many persons had seen before, and there at least they would find shelter and

            <p>Conner was clearly a resource for this infant community. He was "victualer" to the

                    market for the surplus products of the pioneers, and immigrants soon learned to carry money and buy
                    their provisions rather than haul bulky goods over bad forest roads. When local production outran
                    demand, Conner secured a keelboat from <placeName>

            <p>Land was the object of every settler's ambition. By their early industry, the first settlers
                    hoped to gain an advantage in selecting new public lands. However there was risk in being first.
                    "Squatters" who ran ahead of required government surveys enjoyed no protection of
                    their property. The country around William Conner's home was first surveyed in 1821; the

                    the tracts on which they lived. For Conner the prospect was even more chilling. He had lived two
                    decades on his large natural farm. He would not lightly be turned off his land.</p>

            <p>Facing the prospect of losing his farm at the auction, William Conner exercised his rights under the
                    congressional act of May 7, 1822, which granted him a section of land on behalf of his Indian wife
                    and children. On August 31, 1822, he entered a claim to the land comprising his fields. Not
                    satisfied with the security of this estate, however, he purchased within the next month a total of
                    785 acres near his home and along the river. By the end of 1822 his investments in land had grown to
                    nearly one thousand dollars. Unlike most of his neighbors, Conner had ready money; his dealings with
                    the Indians and with their removal had left him sufficient cash to buy this virgin land. As the

            <p>Typically in a new country, the first residents figured prominently in the formation of civil
                    government. From a relatively small pool came the framers of organic documents and first
                    institutions. It was a feature of the nineteenth-century frontier, however, that the fluid period
                    was very short. Whatever equality the wilderness imposed on the pioneers quickly gave way to a
                    hierarchy of power. Government, politics, land, industry, and commerce all offered ready
                    opportunities for profit and advancement that were more dramatic than their counterparts in
                    established society. But freedom and equality notwithstanding, men like William Conner often played
                    a larger role because they were known leaders with resources to devote to community growth. For
                    example, the first commissioners' court met in May, 1823, at Conner's log house;
                    and while not all county functions took place at Conner's, his large brick home, finished
                    in late 1823, was the regular courtroom for both circuit justices and county officials for at least
                    two more years.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Public facilities were capital burdens not easily shouldered

                    ruled early Indiana; these relationships contributed to their early power. The Conners were
                    influential in the very creation of the new county, in the location of its seat of justice, and in
                    the appointment of its first officers. John Conner had served for four sessions in the Indiana
                    senate before he moved in 1822 to the Horseshoe <placeName>

                    the White River. In 1825 John returned to the general assembly as a representative to the house.
                    William Conner served in various county offices through the 1820s before winning a seat in 1829 as a
                    state representative. William served for three sessions, none of them consecutive, with

                    work, William Conner knew how to get it. He was faithful to his friends in the Whitewater
                    faction—Jonathan Jennings, James Noble, James M. Ray, and others—following
                    them first into Henry <placeName>

                    1831 Conner attended the first Whig nominating convention ever held in Indiana, and he was a regular
                    delegate to his party's conventions for two decades thereafter.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> But
                    aside from securing useful influence, Conner left politics to the new breed of professionals who
                    understood the game.</p>
            <p>At the fringes of politics lay a field in which Conner kept a more prominent role: Indian affairs.
                    Although nearly all the Delawares moved west between 1820 and 1823, the Indian presence was hardly
                    gone from central Indiana. Conner often labored to relieve the occasional hostilities that erupted
                    between new settlers—who had never lived among the Indians—and friendly
                    natives who resided in Indiana or had come from the north to trade. He also helped mediate property
                    claims between local Indians and white settlers. Nevertheless, corruption of the Indian culture
                    continued apace as eventual removal loomed. In 1827 Conner lent his support to John <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName>'s scheme for removing the federal agency from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where dealers in whiskey were debauching the natives until "riot and
                    drunkenness" ensued, too often terminating in "cruel murders."
                    Superficially cast in terms of protecting the resident Indians, the change of location really set
                    the stage for a new round of negotiations, land cessions, contracts, debt payments, land
                    speculations, and other profiteering associated with Indian removal. Conner still served at times as
                    interpreter for the government, as in an 1826 treaty with Potawatomis and Miamis, for which Conner
                    received another donation of land. By 1832 he was seeking appointment to a new federal commission
                    that would settle the terms for the final removal of the Indiana tribes.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

                    Conner profitted in several ways. He was compensated directly for his services, either by payments
                    in money or donations of land. Conner was usually a creditor to the Indians, and he filed claims of
                    this sort for bills that would likely otherwise never be paid. Finally, the treaties promised
                    payments to the Indians in money and goods as well as provisions for their trek west. Conner was
                    often a bidder for contracts to supply the Indians at government expense. In 1827, for example, he
                    offered to provide two hundred hogs for two hundred dollars below the estimate given in a treaty
                    with the Miamis which he had helped to write just months before.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> To the end,
                    Indian removal proved to be a good business for Conner.</p>
            <p>Profit was the one continuity in William Conner's otherwise eclectic life. Whatever role he
                    played as Indian liaison, politician, and founder of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton County</region>
                    </placeName>, Conner was above all else a capitalist. His overwhelming importance in the infant
                    economy of the White River country stemmed from wealth he accumulated during his years with the
                    Delaware people. Whether from furs, whiskey, or padded claims for unpaid Indian debts, Conner
                    gathered up money in the early 1800s. Among the first settlers, he alone could buy large amounts of
                    land and still have the capital to bring it into production.</p>
            <p>Capital formation on the frontier was a chronic problem which few men could solve.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> The prairie itself—over two hundred acres of treeless fields—was
                    Conner's first economic advantage. Newcomers would spend years cutting timber and grubbing
                    stumps before they could boast so much arable land. Probably under fence and producing wheat, rye,
                    and corn as early as 1823, Conner's farm was easily the largest in the county and provided
                    a living for a number of tenants or employees as well as the Conner household. About 1825 Conner
                    built a distillery that allowed him to export corn more economically as whiskey. In buying grain for
                    this purpose he created a market for the small surplus product of his struggling neighbors. Conner
                    bought large amounts of land which, although no records survive, he probably rented to farmers on
                    shares. Such tenancy often allowed families to defer their investment <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Mills for grinding grain and sawing lumber were the first industrial plants required by a new
                    community. Once more the Conners were involved. Around 1824 John Conner invested his own wealth in a
                    mill at the Horseshoe <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Fitted with grindstones, a saw, and a carding engine, Conner's mill produced
                    vital services for the farmers of the area. Even the construction of the dam and millrace created
                    jobs for the community. For most families a few days of paid labor brought in the scarce cash
                    required to buy land, pay interest on borrowed money, and pay taxes. After John Conner's
                    death in 1826, William operated the mill at Horseshoe <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> through tenants or partners. In 1844 the factory was entirely remodeled, fitted with
                    the latest machines, and placed in the hands of an Englishman who was hired to run them. Conner
                    advertised his mill as offering the "most modern" services for low prices payable
                    in wheat, flaxseed, beeswax, tallow, feathers, Ginseng, corn, oats, rye, rags, and wool!<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The variety of exchange accepted at Conner's mill points to another key feature of the
                    American frontier: there was never enough money and seldom enough division of labor to support a
                    totally cash economy. Storekeepers often became clearing agents for complex exchanges that fell
                    somewhere between primitive barter and urban commerce. Like most other western merchants, William
                    Conner found that by keeping a retail store he could participate in trade at almost any level,
                    maximizing his opportunities for profit while retaining flexibility in a quickly changing market.
                    Merchants like Conner became produce vendors, import-export jobbers, retailers, wholesalers, credit
                    agents, and moneylenders in their tireless search for ways to exchange the surplus of the frontier
                    for the products and services of civilization.</p>

                    spring—and sometimes again in the fall—the merchant called in his accounts,
                    collected his money, and went east to purchase "a stock of goods." When the
                    merchandise arrived, the storekeeper advertised it for sale "at the best prices."
                    Ideally the goods were sold for cash, but most merchants took produce in trade and extended book
                    credit to regular customers.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> In this manner the merchant accumulated the small
                    change of the country as well as the surplus of the small farmers. Much of what little silver there
                    was in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton County</region>
                    </placeName> might have flowed into Conner's hands each spring when he collected his
                    accounts. As a merchant of standing, Conner probably paid for his eastern purchases with bank paper
                    or bills of exchange, so the specie need not have left the country. The same silver then passed once
                    more into many hands as Conner bought hogs and corn in the autumn, or paid wages to workmen at the
                    mills or on his farms. As early as 1822 and continuing at least into the 1840s there is evidence of
                    Conner buying hogs and grain in large quantities, sometimes borrowing money from the State Bank of
                    Indiana to finance these agricultural speculations.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> As the markets fluctuated
                    and the seasons progressed, Conner invested in produce, livestock, and retail
                    goods—taking credits and debits of different description, trying to realize a profit at
                    each conversion, and increasing the circulation of money and wealth through the infant economy.</p>
            <p>Conner's storekeeping was almost always carried on with a partner. This was doubly
                    convenient. Conner usually stayed home to supervise his many enterprises while the partners traveled
                    to the East, and he gained a measure of financial protection against agents and employees who did
                    not share in the risk. In 1826 John Conner's death left William in charge of
                    John's store in <placeName>

                    although Conner kept the real estate. In 1824 William first acquired a license to trade groceries

                    appeared as a partner in small country stores in surrounding towns such as Eagle Village, <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Partnerships often served as a means of investing in another man's business at a time when
                    retail banking was locally underdeveloped. In 1837, for example, William Conner and John D.
                    Stephenson entered into a partnership with John J. Will, a shoemaker in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Noblesville</settlement>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> It seems unlikely that Conner or his rich colleague Stephenson
                    spent much time at the cobbler's bench; rather, their interest was that of lenders, and the
                    partnership served in place of a long note or mortgage paper. Such expedient solutions to capital
                    shortages were typical in frontier communities, but institutions of modern capitalism were quick to
                    replace them. As early as 1834 William Conner was a subscription agent for the proposed
                    Lawrenceburgh &amp; <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Railroad—one of the first business corporations in the region.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Land was the bedrock of frontier wealth, and Conner's great holdings provided him with the
                    best foundation among his peers. From the date of the first auction Conner steadily accumulated
                    property in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton County</region>
                    </placeName> and elsewhere. By the time he left his White River farm in 1837, he owned some four
                    thousand acres in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton County</region>
                    </placeName> alone. He had paid the government minimum of $1.25 per acre for almost every
                    parcel, so over time the accrued value of his holdings must have exceeded his investment. In

                        <region type="county">Hamilton County</region>

                    and surrounding towns, and he owned considerable amounts of unimproved land in other counties as

                    intended to profit from his speculation in land. He borrowed money from banks for buying hogs and
                    farm produce, and he may have secured such debts with land. He may also have used his land
                    informally as evidence of his wealth when raising personal notes, commercial credits, and bills of
                    exchange. No personal account books survive in which transactions might have been recorded, but he
                    may have sold farms on credit, retaining the deed until the obligation was paid. Finally, for
                    Conner, land may have been a savings bank. In the highly inflationary and cash-short economy of the
                    Jacksonian West, there were few places to store wealth where it would not rapidly erode.
                    Conner's buying habits reflected a steady increase in his riches that outran his
                    opportunities for reasonable investment—or his willingness to risk anymore!</p>
            <p>Town founding was a special form of land speculation, and the successful investors in new western
                    towns were dramatically rewarded. In 1823 William Conner and Josiah F. Polk platted <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Noblesville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the new county seat, on land they purchased from the federal government for
                    $1.25 per acre. They laid out streets and public areas, donated numerous lots for public
                    buildings, mechanics, industries, schools, churches, and later railroad depots. Their original
                    generosity helped bring the struggling village to life, and in the second decade the proprietors
                    were routinely accepting fifty dollars and more for lots that had cost them twenty-five cents. Town
                    founding, however, was not always so fruitful. Responding in 1836 to the promise of the Central
                    Canal, Conner invested in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Madison County</region>
                    </placeName> town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>
                    </placeName>; but the canal was never built, and the town failed to take off. Similarly in 1837
                    Conner platted Strawtown on the site of an old Delaware village along the original trace between his
                    trading post and his brother John's. Once again the site failed to prosper. Nevertheless,
                    Conner's profits from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Noblesville</settlement>

            <p>Life in the wilderness was intensely individualistic, but frontiersmen like Conner never escaped the
                    systems of government and enterprise that linked them to organized society. On the contrary, they
                    were most often bearers of white culture and social institutions. During his early years among the
                    Delaware Indians William Conner was as far outside white civilization as a man might willingly go;
                    yet his reason for being there flowed from America's commercial penetration of the Indian
                    world. Except as an agent of the American empire Conner makes no historical sense. His business
                    depended on exploiting the difference in values between the Indian and white trading systems. His
                    importance to the Delawares derived exclusively from his ability and willingness to provide them
                    with goods and negotiate for them with the advancing aliens. The government's forbearance
                    in letting men like Conner live outside white jurisdiction—and frequently outside the
                    law—came from their usefulness as liaisons to the resident tribes. Without the profits of
                    the fur trade, without the eventual removal of the Indians and the arrival of white settlers,
                    Conner's presence in the West would have been a curiosity. Of course, Conner labored in his
                    own behalf: his life was governed most of all by the free pursuit of private gain. But in his
                    freedom and his enterprise William Conner brought the powerful new systems of expanding America into
                    the harassed and fragile Delaware world.</p>
            <p>It was Conner's decision to stay when the Indians left that helps to clarify his role as an
                    agent of frontier advance and development. Many traders never made the transformation back to white
                    civilization; for these men the role of intruder in a strange world carried its own rewards. That
                    was not enough for William Conner. He stayed to parlay his winnings from one period into the next,
                    and his bets continued to pay. His wealth, his understanding of the place, and simply his being
                    there first all contributed <list type="footnotes">

                    capital to improvements, and he matched opportunities with needs in the developing community.
                    Ironically the success of his efforts as a local developer hastened the passing of the frontier
                    conditions that nourished the old pioneer.</p>
            <p>The panic of 1837 and the depression that followed in 1839 marked the end of the frontier period in
                    much of central Indiana. Primitive economic structures went down in the wreckage and were replaced
                    by more sophisticated institutions of modern urban commercial society. The western land bubble
                    burst, and the chain of credits that rested on the rising value of unimproved land collapsed.
                    William Conner and other speculators suffered large paper losses as their primary form of investment
                    became a drug on the market. Conner's ability to raise cash was severely curtailed by the
                    depression. Time and again he forfeited property to judgments and sheriffs sales because it was
                    easier to give up land, for which there was no market anyway, than to raise cash to pay money debts.
                    The swirl of bankruptcies that began in 1839 continued to dominate business affairs in central
                    Indiana well into the 1840s, and in his seventieth year William Conner was still party to legal
                    proceedings both for and against him.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conner was far from ruined by the depression of 1839, but he was finally displaced in the 1840s as a
                    fountainhead of local power. Despite his advanced age he continued to keep a store in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, but his ledger for 1847–1849 records an old-fashioned country trade that
                    was little changed from the earlier pioneer days. While younger merchants built large inventories,
                    opened branch stores, and even specialized in a few lines of goods, Conner still sold
                    "mdse" in exchange for wheat, currants, feathers, and fowls. As late as 1850 he
                    laid in a "stock of goods" from <placeName>

                    and languages, his success as a trader, the confidence with which he walked in Indian society, and
                    his service to the advancing <placeName>

                    "pioneers" the exploits of a man like Conner took on heroic proportions. The old
                    frontiersman must have enjoyed his last role as a sage of the forest and principal authority on
                    Indian life and lore. On August 28, 1855, William Conner died. Seventy-eight years was a generous
                    life-span, even more remarkable for one who had lived in a "primitive" style more
                    than half that time. He left a large estate, two families of children, and no last will and
                    testament. The Delaware Conners did return and sue for a share of their father's fortune,
                    but predictably the courts disallowed their claims. One unwritten condition of Conner's
                    reentry into white society was the renunciation of Indian ways: agents like Conner could not have
                    their forest idylls and empire too. By the time of Conner's death the Delawares were the
                    alien people in a <placeName>

                    James Blake was appointed a commissioner to advertise for architectural plans and to obtain stone
                    for the foundation.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> In May, 1831, Blake placed advertisements in at least seven
                    newspapers of local, regional, and national circulation, providing specifications for the building
                    and offering a premium of $150 for the best plans. The deadline for entries was November
                    10, 1831. The legislature would select the winning plans.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The competition attracted the attention of architects across the nation. On December 15 Blake
                    presented twenty-one plans from sixteen architects for the Indiana General Assembly's
                    consideration. Among the competitors were five of the leading architects of the day: Town and Davis
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> All five were practitioners in the popular Greek Revival mode of
                    architectural design; thus, perhaps it was foreordained that the winning plan would be cast in that
                    style.</p>
            <p>The plan of Town and Davis, calling for a Greek Doric temple surmounted by a Renaissance dome,
                    emerged as the choice of the legislature's Joint Committee on Public Buildings at the end
                    of December.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The full General Assembly awarded the premium to Town on January
                    26, 1832.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is difficult to ascertain why the assembly selected the Town and Davis design. A comparison of the
                    winning entry with its competitors is impossible, since only Town and Davis's design has
                    survived. One explanation for the choice involves Town's fame as the architect of the
                    Connecticut statehouse at <placeName>

                    a Doric temple much like the Town and Davis design for the Indiana project; hence Town could present

                    belongs to the persuasive powers of Ithiel Town. His presence in the midst of the legislators must

                    Parthenon, which was peripteral (a colonnade surrounded the whole temple). In addition, in each of
                    the two porticoes of the statehouse, only the end columns of the second rank were present, contrary
                    to the full, double ranks of the Parthenon (see Figures E and F). Of the sculptural adornments of
                    the Parthenon's exterior, only the triglyphs appeared in the Indiana version. Missing were
                    the sculptured figures in the tympanums, the carvings in the metopes, and the shields along the
                    architrave. Moreover, some of the embellishments depicted in Davis's perspective drawing
                    (see Figure B), such as the antefixes along the cornice, ridge of the roof, and at the base of the
                    dome, as well as the palmettes and anthemia shown at the apexes and ends of the pediments, do not

            <p>On the other hand, the statehouse did feature octostyle porticoes and seventeen piers in the form of
                    either columns or antae along each of its flanks, thus reproducing the number of portico and flank
                    columns in the Parthenon (see Figures E and F). The pseudoperipteral combination of portico columns
                    and antae simulated the rhythm of the Athenian temple. Practical considerations, such as the need
                    for sufficient light in the interior chambers, possibly precluded a true peripteral colonnade.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Much of the plan of the Indiana capitol probably derived from the Connecticut statehouse design. In
                    both buildings, two legislative halls flanked a central rotunda.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> In the
                    Indiana building, both the "Representatives' Hall" and the
                    "Senate Chamber" were semicircular auditoriums occupying two stories (see Figure
                    C). An Ionic colonnade in each hall served as a screen from the lobbies and visitor galleries and as
                    additional structural support for the coved ceilings.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In plan the rotunda, drum, and dome were circular, the dome resting on a two-and-one-half-story,
                    brick cylinder (see Figures C and I). Contrary to the central, spiral stairway shown in the 1834
                    plan, the stairways were probably along the sides of the rotunda.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> The Supreme
                    Court room was adjacent to the rotunda, perhaps on the second floor. The committee rooms for the
                    legislature were on the first floor.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Strangely enough, no provision was made
                    for a governor's office, a curious oversight, since Governor Noah Noble served as one of
                    the statehouse commissioners.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Town suggested to the commissioners in 1832 that the square north of the capitol site be combined
                    with Statehouse Square to form a single, oblong site corresponding to the shape of the building to
                    be erected. He probably found the intended site too restrictive for a building of the prominence of
                    a state capitol. He also recommended that the basement story of the statehouse be raised in height,
                    either to create a full basement or to enhance the building's monumental qualities on a
                    sunken site. The legislature <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>The exterior walls, columns, antae, and rotunda wall of the statehouse were brick. The foundation was
                    made of "blue, Bluff limestone" and brick. Laths covered the entire exterior
                    (walls, antae, columns, entablature, etc.), which was given two coats of stucco, the second of which
                    contained a mixture of lime and sand. The stuccoed facade was then scored to represent the joints of
                    ashlar masonry. Stained with mineral colors, the surface resembled stone even further.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> The interior structure of the capitol, except for the rotunda walls, was wood frame.
                    Plank ribs formed the dome, and the lantern, or "cupola," was of "wood
                    entirely." A zinc covering was specified for the roof of the building and for the dome.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>In December, 1834, the statehouse commissioners announced to the legislature that the building would

            <p>Debate over the architectural propriety of Town and Davis's design for the Indiana
                    statehouse began even before it was completed. In April, 1835, the editor of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>-based <hi rend="i">American Monthly Magazine</hi> savagely attacked the combined temple
                    and dome designs of Town and Davis, calling the proposed dome for the Federal Customs House in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> (designed by the firm the previous year) "an excrescence, which, however
                    elegant it itself, is utterly monstrous and barbarous when added to a model of the present Grecian
                    architecture, such as the Parthenon or the <pb n="344" id="VAA4025-080-4-050"/> Theseion."
                    The editor referred to the firm's use of a dome in the design for the Indiana capitol as
                        "vandalism."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several years later, the <hi rend="i">Family Magazine,</hi> also published in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, took the opposite view, acclaiming the design of the Indiana statehouse. The magazine
                    commented that it "may be considered the nearest approach to the classical spirit of the
                    antique <hi rend="i">yet instanced in the Western hemisphere.</hi>"<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
                    The writer of the article, who may have belonged to the cultural circle of Town and Davis, defended
                    the introduction of antae along the flanks of the temple form. He pointed out that the projecting
                    forms partially concealed the many windows from view, saving the building from "the
                    character of a factory" and providing the illusion of support for the full entablature
                    along the sides. Regarding the combination of dome with temple, the writer conceded that as a matter
                    of taste the propriety of adding a dome was questionable. Nevertheless, he argued that the dome of
                    the Indiana capitol denoted the special character of its edifice. To the distant observer,
                    "the dome and lantern, rising proudly above surrounding objects enhances the richness of
                    the scene."<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The local press in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was at first also congratulatory. Upon the statehouse's completion at the end
                    of 1835, the <hi rend="i">Indiana Democrat</hi> thanked all the construction supervisors and the
                    workers for their efforts, enthusiastically referring to the outward appearance of the new
                    statehouse as "truly splendid."<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, by the end of the Civil War, the design of the statehouse had passed from favor in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. W. R. Holloway, who published the first comprehensive history of the city in 1870,
                    condemned the building for both its temple form and for the addition of the dome. He observed that a
                    Greek temple was intended for mountainous countries, where it could cap natural elevations and
                    harmonize with the scenery. On the other hand, "the Grecian style is not fitted for a level
                    country. Its heavy architrave, low roof, square form, and lack of elevation, make it look squatty in
                    a plain." Like the editor of <hi rend="i">American Monthly Magazine,</hi> Holloway viewed
                    the combination of a dome and a Greek temple as a distasteful and unnatural marriage. Even if one
                    set aside the problem of situating the temple form on a plain, "the incongruous,
                    contemptible dome should have condemned it utterly. It don't [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] belong
                    to the Grecian style, it is Roman. The Greeks knew nothing of domes or arches."<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

            <p>If just the style and design of the statehouse had been objectionable, the Indiana citizenry might
                    have retained it. What really "condemned" it was the impermanence of its
                    construction. Holloway reported that the limestone used in the foundation was far from durable. The
                    stone began to scale only a few years after construction, and by 1870 had "decayed so
                    greatly as to disfigure, if not endanger, portions of the walls."<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The walls themselves, as well as the columns, antae, and entablature, were covered with
                    Town's stucco. This material fared poorly in the freeze-and-thaw cycle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> winters. By the 1860s, chunks of the ersatz masonry were breaking off, exposing the
                    brick structure beneath. Holloway pronounced the statehouse's appearance
                    "disgusting," while Jacob P. Dunn, a later historian, referred to its appearance
                    during its last years as that of "a genuine Grecian ruin."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Apparently the plaster work in the interior was also of uncertain quality. In 1867 the coved ceiling
                    in the "Representative hall" collapsed and made a "magnificent
                    wreck." Although no one was present when the collapse occurred, this episode apparently
                    alarmed the legislators enough to support proposals for a new capitol.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> In
                    1877, only slightly over forty years after its completion, the second Indiana statehouse was

                        one other Indiana building. In the spring of 1835 an agent for the newly established Wabash
                        College, at <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>

            <p>When F#2 D. Roosevelt launched the New Deal in 1933, he initiated a new epoch in American urban
                    history. In contrast to his predecessor, Herbert C. Hoover, the new president decided that the
                    federal government should assume the main responsibility for dealing with the Depression. First and
                    foremost through its relief measures and second through its recovery and reform policies, the New
                    Deal established the federal government as a vital factor in the lives of the nation's
                    urban dwellers. As a result of Roosevelt's programs, the urban unemployed received work
                    relief, industrial unions won collective bargaining rights, homeowners obtained mortgage aid, and
                    slum dwellers saw a glimmer of hope for the future. The urban electorate showed its gratitude for
                    these reforms by forming the bedrock of a new voter coalition that enabled the Democratic party to
                    dominate national politics for the next thirty years.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet many historians have argued that in reality the New Deal did little to alleviate the problems of
                    the cities per se or to improve the quality of urban life.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> According to Mark I.

                    and city dwellers. By 1940 the federal government had woven broad strands in the pattern of this
                    Hoosier community's life. In particular, the New Deal reformed <placeName>

                    and helped to increase the power of local trade unions. Nevertheless, the scope of these changes
                    would have been greater but for the opposition of certain local interest groups. On the other hand,

                    in most northern industrial cities. In fact, Indiana's "Summit City"
                    provides an interesting example of how a local Republican organization succeeded in turning back the
                    Democratic urban tidal wave that Roosevelt had generated.</p>
            <p>The first problem was relief. The federal program commenced in mid-1933: over the next two years the
                    Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) gave grants-in-aid to Indiana, totaling more than
                    seventy-one million dollars. State officials distributed these funds to local communities on a
                    matching grant basis. Relief authorities in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen County</region>
                    </placeName> initially used the money to finance direct public aid and work relief projects. Later,
                    in November, 1933, a new federal agency, the Civil Works Administration (CWA), assumed direct
                    responsibility for all work relief. During CWA's five-month existence, over three thousand <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen County</region>
                    </placeName> residents were put to work on federal relief projects. After the agency's
                    demise, FERA funds again underwrote both forms of relief aid in the Summit City.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The infusion of federal money resolved <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s immediate relief problems. Serious shortcomings were evident in
                    Indiana's FERA relief system, however. Even though federal and state authorities were now
                    involved in providing unemployment relief, township trustees still heavily influenced aid
                    distribution at the community level. Few trustees had the professional ability or time to deal
                    adequately with relief problems during the 1930s. Some were corrupt; many were just political hacks.
                    In general, they tended to apply subjective standards in granting relief.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                    Before 1933 the unemployed in <placeName>

                    </placeName> had not complained loudly about Wayne Township trustee, Elmer Fox, perhaps because they
                    feared reprisals. The New Deal evidently raised their expectations about relief standards and gave
                    them hope for federal protection from local politicians. In September the <placeName>

                    grocery stores, and refused relief to those among the unemployed who dared to criticize its

                    Unfortunately, but predictably, Barnes did not have a good working relationship with his three
                    colleagues, who were professional social workers and newcomers to <placeName>

                    </placeName> into a centralized, professional relief system operating under standards set by GCUR.
                    To Barnes they appeared as heartless bureaucrats, who threatened home rule and possessed no
                    understanding of the local community. Therefore, he joined with Elmer Fox and the executive

            <p>The reformed GCUR system suffered unceasingly from unfavorable comparisons with CWA, an agency that

                    </placeName>. CWA had also adopted flexible standards concerning the eligibility of relief
                        applicants.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The GCUR county commission had less money from FERA to finance
                    work relief. Fewer than twenty-eight hundred people now received relief work each month in <placeName>

                    complained that they were expected to live on unrealistic budgets. Sinclair's refusal to

                    Sinclair and her professional colleagues emphasized that they were merely implementing
                    GCUR's policy. As a result, the unemployed tended to forget the shortcomings of the
                    township relief system and clamored for some restitution of home rule.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Tempers
                    became frayed on both sides and provoked irrational judgments. One GCUR field representative
                    complained, for example, that the FERA grievance committee was "composed of the most bitter
                    radicals in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>." In turn, relief recipients attributed many of the shortcomings of the new
                    system to GCUR's reliance on young female social workers who had no experience raising a
                        family.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In December, 1934, open conflict broke out between Sinclair and Barnes when the latter insisted that
                    twenty relief families should receive supplemental direct aid. Nadia Deem, the GCUR's
                    social service director, immediately called for his dismissal.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> However, both <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers were inundated with letters of support for the local man. The FERA grievance
                    committee, with support from Fox and Fuller, demanded that GCUR create an investigative department,
                    staffed entirely by local people, to help the case work supervisor make decisions on relief
                        cases.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Samuel Cleland, the chairman of the <placeName>

                    was up in arms against the relief administrators. He himself believed that "the destitute
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>

                    Wayne Coy, a GCUR executive, poured oil on the troubled waters by refusing to dismiss Barnes and
                    agreeing to some of the grievance committee's minor demands, notably that each
                    individual's relief work hours be evenly distributed throughout the month. Nevertheless,
                    bad feelings did not subside. In February, 1935, FERA workers organized a huge petition drive
                    calling for the return of direct relief to township control and for a federal investigation of GCUR

            <p>Although leading federal officials like Howard Hunter supported GCUR in its efforts to reform
                    Indiana's relief system, the influence of this organization declined from
                    mid–1935 onward. With the economy improving, Roosevelt decided to terminate federal
                    involvement in direct relief.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> FERA was abolished and replaced by the Works
                    Progress Administration (WPA). This new agency financed only work relief projects and was
                    administered directly from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> through district offices, not by the states. The revamped relief system worked far more
                    harmoniously than had its predecessor in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> because it struck an acceptable balance between federal control and home rule. WPA bore
                    about two-thirds of total relief costs in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen County</region>
                    </placeName> from 1935 to 1938, but the township trustee's office regained some of its
                    influence since local taxes again bore the entire burden for direct relief in Indiana. Moreover,
                    WPA's district office did not allocate relief on the same basis as the GCUR's
                    county commission and normally accepted the trustee's certification of each
                    applicant's eligibility for aid.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The new agency spent over $1.75 million on wages in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen County</region>
                    </placeName> during its first nine months of operation. Its monthly payroll rose steadily until
                    March, 1936, when 3,958 local residents received work relief. With the gradual improvement of the
                    economy, the number dropped to 2,145 by June, 1937.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> This downward trend was
                    rudely interrupted by the onset of the so-called "Roosevelt Recession" in the fall
                    of 1937. By June, 1938, 23,697 people, 16.1 percent of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen County</region>
                    </placeName>'s population, were receiving some form of welfare aid. This figure included
                    14,228 people who were dependent on WPA earnings of members of their family.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
                    In these circumstances discord over the relief setup returned, but complaints about WPA were quite
                    different from those directed at GCUR. The Democratic party had naturally made numerous patronage

                    public attention to this practice and seized the opportunity to accuse the agency of
                    maladministration and waste. Many people also complained about <placeName>

                    expenditures increased the relief burden on local government. Wayne Township was forced to spend
                    $128,599 on direct relief in the first quarter of 1939, compared with only
                    $56,771 during the same period in 1937. As a result both <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s difficulties in the early years of the Depression had convinced the
                    community that citizens who could not get work had a right to unemployment relief.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> The New Deal built on this foundation, demonstrating to the community that its obligations
                    to the unemployed could not be fulfilled without federal aid. In part, this belief developed and
                    endured because Roosevelt's programs did not deal with unemployment solely as a Depression
                    phenomenon. The Social Security legislation, in particular, established the basis of a new welfare
                    state. By mid–1938, 2,697 <placeName>

                    opposition to GCUR policy, the New Deal raised the community's expectations about suitable
                    relief standards. This development certainly affected the township trustee's office. Thanks
                    to the partial recovery of home rule, old practices could still continue, of course, but the trustee
                    was under greater public scrutiny than ever before. For example, in 1938 Local 901 of the United

                    requested Public Works Administration (PWA) funds for three projects. These were the construction of

            <p>Impressive though this catalog of municipal improvements may appear, relatively few of the projects
                    benefited the areas suffering from urban decay, namely those on the fringes of the downtown
                    district. Of course, the whole community gained from the sewage improvements, although one area of
                    low-income housing in western <placeName>

                    </placeName> did not receive a sewer hookup until 1951. Nevertheless, two of the major projects,
                    aimed to speed up crosstown traffic, aided the outer, rather than the inner, city areas.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> In addition, none of the main recreational improvements were carried out in

                    of leisure facilities in the area.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> The most pressing need of the inner city
                    was better housing. The New Deal did relatively little to alleviate this problem, partly because of
                    its own limitations, but also because of opposition from powerful local interest groups.</p>
            <p>The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which provided federal insurance for private mortgages, had
                    been created to encourage banks to loan money for new construction. Nevertheless, the agency was
                    reluctant to insure mortgages for housing in blighted areas because it was obliged not to operate at
                    a loss. Inevitably, this policy led to discrimination against urban districts with the worst housing
                        problems.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> In <placeName>

                    on the northern, western, and southeastern edges of the city. Owing to its conservative mortgage
                    policy, the FHA's efforts to revive the local construction industry reaped only partial

                    commencement of FHA operations did produce a steady increase thereafter, but new construction during
                    the 1930s never matched the levels achieved in the previous decade. Only 369 new houses were built

                    mortgages with government money at an interest rate of 5 percent, with the borrower having fifteen
                    years to repay. In <placeName>

                    $11,642,000. Mortgage foreclosures fell from 612 in 1932 to 295 in 1934 as a result of
                    HOLC activities. Nevertheless, HOLC did not always operate in a benevolent manner. In particular, it
                    dispossessed those families who could not continue repayments on their federal mortgage. This policy
                    partly accounted for the rise again in foreclosures to 531 in 1935. The number fell only to 426 in
                    the following year and rose once more when the recession hit <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>. HOLC also refused to aid unemployed homeowners and closely investigated each applicant
                    to determine whether he or she was a sound risk. These practices caused it to adopt what was in
                    effect a "redlining" policy. The agency graded <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s neighborhoods according to their suitability for mortgage aid.
                    Classification was based not only upon each area's housing standards and accessibility to
                    public transport but also upon the general socioeconomic status of its residents. The lowest grade,
                    "D," denoted an area of "low class population," where blacks,
                    foreign born, and poor whites were numerous. HOLC did make some mortgage loans to residents of
                    "D" districts but was obviously less sympathetic to them than to residents of
                    other areas. It was also reluctant to hold mortgages on property in five of the nineteen
                    "C" areas. These neighborhoods had housing of reasonable quality but were regarded
                    as susceptible to infiltration from <list type="footnotes">

                    the local contribution to the venture. All eleven community associations protested the conditions
                    appended to federal aid. USHA wanted the relaxation of certain zoning regulations that inhibited
                    public housing construction in many neighborhoods; it also demanded the enactment of a new municipal

                    </placeName> Housing Authority (FWHA) decided to renegotiate with the federal government, and the
                    city council vetoed the proposals for housing reform. A new agreement was finally reached in
                    November, 1939, whereby USHA undertook construction of one hundred houses and FWHA pledged to repair
                    or demolish an equal number of structures.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The community associations were also eager to preserve the zoning regulations in order to prevent the
                    spread of municipal prefabricated housing. In 1938 the newly created FWHA, acting in conjunction
                    with WPA and FHA, was responsible for one of the most interesting experimental housing ventures of
                    the New Deal era. Its chairman, William B. Hall, son of the eminent civic leader Arthur F. Hall,
                    arranged to lease fifty plots of land scattered throughout the eastern inner city for one dollar
                    each. Although most of the plots were vacant, ramshackle structures stood on some. The owners of the
                    land were exempted from payment of municipal taxes on the properties. After carrying out demolition,
                    WPA erected a prefabricated dwelling on each plot. Free labor reduced FWHA's unit costs to
                    only $900. Three local banks provided the housing authority with $45,000 in
                    mortgage funds, which FHA insured. Weekly rental charges of only $2.50 were sufficient to
                    pay off the loan in twenty years.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Over six hundred low-income families applied
                    for the new prefabricated homes but only fifty could be accommodated. In 1939, hoping to profit from
                    the proposed relaxation of zoning regulations, Hall announced plans to construct two hundred
                    additional units. The community associations voiced strong objections, however, because they feared
                    that the simple prefabricated structures, which they denounced as "New Deal chicken
                    coops," would lower property values if they were located in neighborhoods other than the
                    east-central district.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The city council's veto of the proposed housing reforms obviously restricted FWHA's
                    opportunities for acquiring new leases, so Hall reduced his target to one hundred.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Another group now worked to thwart even this modified proposal. The so-called "<placeName>

                    unions, which protested using relief workers in housing construction projects. Anxious not to offend
                    a political ally, Roosevelt soon bowed to the wishes of the American Federation of Labor and vetoed

                    lacked the fiscal resources to tackle serious urban problems. Although the federal government had
                    assumed primary responsibility for relief, the New Deal did little to alleviate the other fiscal

                    over the tax increase. When Hosey stood firm, there was talk of a tax strike, and the mayor received

                    $2.75, a decision that effectively cut the city-county budget by $2,700,000.
                    The Civil City alone had to run on $307,000 less than initially estimated, and the Board
                    of Education's budget was cut by $470,000.<hi rend="sup">59</hi>
                    Hosey's administration kept functioning during the next year by cutting municipal salaries,
                    laying off some employees temporarily or putting them on half-time, reducing the operations of all
                    municipal departments not concerned with public safety, and borrowing from the general municipal
                    fund in anticipation of future tax receipts.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> Nonetheless, in 1934 ACTAB again
                    reduced the tax rate fixed by the city-county government from $3.27 to

                    the verge of fiscal collapse. It could not pay the February wage bill, and the general fund surplus
                    had dwindled to a paltry thirty-two hundred dollars.<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Baals resolved this dilemma by transferring funds from the municipal utilities, which operated at a
                    healthy profit even during the 1930s. The Republican mayor resorted to this measure every year for
                    the remainder of the Depression. Normally about two hundred thousand dollars were transferred
                    directly from City Light to the Civil City general fund. Baals also reversed traditional policy and
                    used City Light money to pay for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s street and alley lighting, saving the Civil City over one hundred thousand
                    dollars each year.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> Hosey, a staunch progressive, had always insisted that
                    utility profits should be reinvested to improve municipal water and electricity services.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> Nevertheless, his successor's action gave the municipal exchequer a
                    needed boost. The new administration also used business accounting techniques to ensure that the
                    city operated on the most cost effective basis possible. Henceforth, all departmental purchases were
                    made through a centralized system that enabled the city to save money by buying in bulk. Better
                    servicing of city vehicles helped to improve their gasoline mileage from six miles per gallon to
                    thirteen. The amalgamation of the City Water and City Light departments reduced their annual
                    administrative costs by seventy-five thousand dollars. Baals even allowed TRA to help public
                    officials analyze the budgetary needs of their departments.<hi rend="sup">66</hi> He led by example
                    and dedicated his first administration to strict economy. As a result, the mayor shelved several
                    important projects dealing with recreational facilities, street-cleaning services, and a new traffic
                    light system.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thanks to these measures and the general improvement of the economy, city-county officials were able
                    to cut the tax rate each year until it stood at $2.24 in 1938. <placeName>

                    in 1939 because of the increased burden on township relief, this figure still compared favorably

                    administration could point to concrete municipal achievements during this era of fiscal austerity.

                    diphtheria also declined markedly. With the creation of its Police Bureau of Traffic, which did much
                    to reduce the number of road accidents, the Summit City won road safety awards from the state
                    government in 1937 and 1939. Finally in 1938 and 1939 City Light and Water Utilities directly

                    achievement was tiding the city over the serious fiscal crisis of 1935. Other than reducing the

                    Disillusioned by the agency's failure to generate full recovery, businessmen also expressed
                    other grievances. In general, the big manufacturing firms disliked the NRA price-fixing agreements;

            <p>Although the Communist party did indeed gain some support within the local labor movement in the

                    communist sympathies, but they could not control their union. Indeed the union's
                    vice-president, Ernest C. Gallmeier, and its wartime president, Sam McAfee, were firm supporters of
                    the Republican party.<hi rend="sup">85</hi> The help of Communist organizers, who had worked to

                    example, Local 57 of the United Automobile Workers at International Harvester accepted aid from the
                    pro-Communist United Farm Workers after losing the 1938 plant election to a company union. The UAW
                    triumphed in the 1940 elections and called a strike when International Harvester refused to grant it
                    a contract. Yet the local would not allow Communist organizers to help with the strike because they
                    were so unpopular among the rank and file membership. Now strong enough not to need Communist aid,
                    the union became the first UAW local to win a contract from International Harvester.<hi rend="sup">86</hi>

                    organization, and its good record in municipal government—had already eroded some of the
                    New Deal's electoral popularity well before the close of the Depression decade.</p>
            <p>In this context the municipal election of 1934 was a crucial event. Democratic mayoral candidates in
                    many cities based their campaigns largely on the need to elect a local administration favorable to
                        Roosevelt.<hi rend="sup">93</hi> Hosey made the mistake of not doing likewise. Instead, he
                    preferred to build his campaign on his long record in office and on the need to preserve the fiscal
                    soundness of the municipal utilities against Republican tax cut proposals.<hi rend="sup">94</hi>
                    Deflecting attention from the New Deal, this strategy enabled the GOP to exploit the tax issue. As a
                    result the Republicans won the mayoralty and four of the nine council seats, even though the
                    Democratic congressional ticket carried <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> by over three thousand votes.<hi rend="sup">95</hi> Four years later the GOP could
                    point to its good record in office and its success in lowering taxes. Every candidate on the local
                    Republican ticket was successful in 1938; Baals himself won a massive victory, losing only two
                        precincts.<hi rend="sup">96</hi>

                    appropriation." In addition, Roosevelt's tariff policy came under fire. Hoping to
                    discredit the president before the workingman, local Republicans blamed the recession of

            <p>The GOP built a powerful local organization during the Depression, despite the loss of its customary
                    state and federal patronage resources in 1933. Control of city hall gave the Republicans the means
                    to create a new political machine. Hosey had tried to keep the municipal utilities outside the realm
                    of patronage politics. In 1930 only two of the fifty-seven Democratic precinct committeepersons held
                    jobs in the utilities, while three more held municipal jobs. Eight years later, fourteen Republican
                    committeepersons worked for the utilities, seven others had members of their family so employed, and
                    six more held other municipal jobs.<hi rend="sup">101</hi> They formed the backbone of an efficient
                    precinct organization, which kept in close touch with constituents and provided many favors. The GOP
                    also maintained a high profile in the community by holding regular rallies. It did not ignore groups
                    that in other cities were regarded as solidly Democratic. For example, in 1938 the Republicans held
                    many "cottage gatherings" at the homes of working-class supporters to inform
                    relief laborers about WPA's shortcomings. The formation of the <placeName>

                    to establish links between the party and the new industrial unions. Not even the small black vote

            <p>In contrast, local Democrats were badly organized and divided by factional controversy during the
                    1930s. Hosey normally kept in close touch with his constituency, but he was less active in the local
                    Democratic organization than in his prime. Aged seventy-six when elected in 1929, he used most of
                    his dwindling energy to fulfill the demands of the mayoral office. In these circumstances, R. Earl
                    Peters, a <placeName>

                    Peters used the local Democratic organization as a base from which to conduct his feud with Governor
                    McNutt who had driven him from his post as state party chairman in 1933. In turn, the statehouse
                    administration strove to break Peters's hold over the local party by starving it of
                    patronage. Although succeeding in 1936–1937, this strategy inevitably bred long-lasting
                    bitterness and made McNutt very unpopular in <placeName>

                    </placeName> Democrats overreacted to Hosey's defeat in 1934. Consumed by internal
                    bickering, they came to rely excessively on Roosevelt's personal appeal during the
                    mid-1930s. They made little effort to win the electorate's gratitude for themselves or to
                    educate the voters about the issues and virtues of the New Deal. The <placeName>

                    should run for mayor in 1938.<hi rend="sup">105</hi> As a result, local Democrats had no solid

                    financed the construction of important municipal projects, focused attention on the housing crisis,
                    and promoted the growth of trade unionism. None of these changes was truly radical in scope,
                    however, partly because of Roosevelt's moderate objectives, but also because local
                    opposition blunted their impact. A degree of continuity therefore characterized <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s experience in the 1930s. Proponents of home rule had helped to undermine
                    GCUR's efforts to professionalize and centralize Indiana's relief administration,
                    realtors and property owners' organizations had thwarted plans to redevelop parts of the
                    inner city to benefit low-income groups, employers had fought a stiff rearguard battle against the
                    rise of industrial unionism, and the local Republicans had beaten back the challenge of
                    Roosevelt's Democracy. On balance, the president's programs had done little to
                    resolve basic urban problems such as inner city decay and the shrinking municipal tax base. On the
                    other hand, the New Deal's impact on local community dynamics was far greater. During the
                    Hoover era the <placeName>

                    </placeName> community had relied on its own resources and solidarity to combat the Depression. The
                    New Deal reversed this situation. Community solidarity inevitably declined from 1933 onward, as some
                    groups became clients of the national government while others resisted the New Deal's
                    expansion of federal power. This Hoosier community could never again act as a relatively independent
                    entity. The New Deal had drawn it into the complicated web of federal-urban relations. Henceforth
                    the federal government would be a vital influence on the economic, social, and political life of <placeName>

            <p>In the words of women ranging in age from one hundred down to twenty-five, this delightful paperback
                    details the hard work, the unending tasks, and the gaiety and joy of keeping a home in rural Indiana
                    in the years from 1890 to 1930. The volume stands as a shining example of the possibilities for
                    effective public use of an oral history project and as a caution against overly logical
                    compartmentalization and too human nostalgia.</p>
            <p>Eleanor Arnold has lovingly brought together excerpts from the oral histories of 243 homemakers from
                    seventy-two counties. The excerpts are short, from a sentence to, very occasionally, three
                    paragraphs, followed by the name, age, and county of the speaker. The excerpts are organized by task
                    into chapters from "Raising and Preserving Fruits and Vegetables,"
                    "Butchering and Curing Meat," to "Eating with Others" (Sunday
                    dinners, family get-togethers), and "Feeding the Workers" (it was nothing to feed
                    sixteen to twenty men from the threshing team).</p>
            <p>The whole is bound together by an insightful introduction that summarizes the average rural home.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>Each extended household was almost self-sufficient…. The household itself was

                        uncles or aunts, or orphaned cousins…. two or more hired men, an occasional hired
                        girl, and numerous guests, invited or drop-in…. the young homemaker of the day was
                        much of the time either pregnant or a nursing mother (pp. 9–11).</p>

            <p>The front and back pages of the volume provide the information that archivists call
                    "provenance," how the collection came to be. The preface explains the initiation
                    of the oral history project <pb n="380" id="VAA4025-080-4-086"/> in preparation for the
                    seventy-fifth anniversary of the Indiana Extension Homemakers Association in 1988, the process of

                    and other memorabilia to be preserved for public use in the Indiana Historical Society. All the
                    interviewees and interviewers are listed in the back of the book. Already a tape/slide show
                    consisting of a sound track of the women's voices and slides from the visuals has been

                    its drawbacks, however. Lacking is a sense of the changes that took place over the years, of the
                    full daily routines of these women, and, most especially, of the social relationships between
                    members of these large, hardworking families. The tasks are isolated in time and context, and the
                    material becomes more a springboard for our own memories, personal or as told to us, than a
                    well-rounded picture of the lives of our not-so-distant fore-mothers. Be that as it may, reading the
                    book aloud will surely stimulate animated conversation between older and younger generations.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Feeding Our Families</hi> is the first of a planned series entitled <hi rend="i">Memories of Hoosier Homemakers</hi> to be drawn from the collection. Others will deal with
                    social and family traditions, courtship and marriage, childbearing and child rearing, and the
                    effects of technology on the homemaker's chores. One suggestion for future volumes in the
                    series is that they include longer excerpts, better pinpointed as to what decade they are describing
                    and revealing more of the speakers' feelings about the significance of their tasks. From
                    this first book it is evident that the whole collection is a gold mine from which new nuggets of
                    insight into our past can be extracted again and again.</p>

            <p>Indiana's contributions to the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) have been few but
                    solid. Only 161 (or about 1 percent) of the more than 16,000 buildings recorded in the Library of
                    Congress archive by 1979 came from Indiana. A handful of shrewd and pragmatic persons with limited
                    time and resources selected the Hoosier sites most likely to be recorded with federal assistance or
                    by volunteers. This volume catalogs the accomplishments of the vanguard that preceded the agencies
                    now charged with historic preservation in the state.</p>

            <p>Begun in late 1933 as employment for architects and draftsmen during the Great Depression, HABS
                    operated until the opening of World War II. Once reactivated in 1957, it quickly surpassed the
                    prewar pace of recording, inaugurated the National Register of Historic Places (1966), and created
                    the Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) (1969) through fission. During this period the
                    federal government also extended its administrative interest and oversight by encouraging the
                    establishment of state historic preservation offices.</p>
            <p>Indiana maneuvered in the wake of federal action. Fourteen of the initial twenty-eight participants
                    contributed to the drawings of the approximately forty sites recorded before World War II. Domestic
                    architecture dominated the early selections, followed by public buildings and an occasional
                    commercial or "engineering" structure. The number of buildings recorded grew
                    dramatically and fitfully with the revival of activity in 1958 and expanded by more than one hundred
                    in the 1970s. The nature of the sites selected, however, did not change substantially, unless one
                    includes HAER's activities which are recognized here only in the appendixes.</p>
            <p>The explosion in the number of sites recorded since World War II quickly outdated even revised
                    versions of a national catalog. Thus, Indiana is about the eleventh to publish a state catalog.
                    Arranged geographically, entries succinctly describe each site, assess its historical significance,
                    and list basic records.</p>
            <p>The Indiana catalog fittingly records the individual interests and personal craftsmanship of a
                    collection of Hoosier pioneer preservationists from David Hermansen, Edward James, and H. Roll
                    McLaughlin to Samuel Roberson. The next generation of entries published will most likely come from
                    more corporate and standardized sources—from private organizations such as the Historic
                    Landmarks Foundation of Indiana or public agencies such as the State Historic Preservation Office.
                    As this volume makes clear, those leading today's efforts will almost inevitably follow
                    many a trail blazed a generation or more ago.</p>

            <p>In <hi rend="i">Conquering the Rivers</hi> Edith McCall has written a biography of the working life
                    of Henry Miller Shreve, whom she calls the "Father of the Mississippi Steamboat."
                    When Shreve was <pb n="384" id="VAA4025-080-4-090"/> three years old in 1788, his family moved from
                    a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> community in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName> to the shores of the Monongahela River. From then until his death in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1851, the Mississippi Valley was his home and its rivers his challenge.
                    Shreve's life-work was to make the Ohio and <geogName>Mississippi river</geogName>s and
                    their tributaries the highways of settlement and commerce for the West. The challenge led him into
                    each phase of his career, from keelboat merchant to steamboat builder, to improver of the steamboat,
                    and finally to inventor of a snag boat that made the rivers safe for navigation. The monuments to
                    his success are the cities that prospered along the rivers he opened and the farmlands that grew to
                    productivity because he cleared the way for marketing their output. As Louis C. Hunter has observed
                    in his classic <hi rend="i">Steamboats on the Western Rivers</hi> (1949): "The growth of
                    the West and the rise of steamboat transportation were inseparable; they were geared together and
                    each was dependent upon the other" (p. 32). Henry Shreve led the way and made possible the
                    growth of the West and the rise of the steamboat.</p>
            <p>McCall, author or coauthor of some forty-five books on topics in American history, has written a
                    lively and engaging narrative about the life of Shreve. She writes history, as Barbara W. Tuchman
                    once said, not "to instruct but to tell a story." The author tells a story well.
                    Through spritely prose the reader follows Shreve in service on flatboat, keelboat, and steamboat as
                    he learned the dangers and idiosyncracies of the Ohio and <geogName>Mississippi river</geogName>s.
                    This intimate knowledge allowed him to design and build his first steamboat, the <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                        </placeName>
                    </hi> (1816), and later the <hi rend="i">George <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> (1824). In building the <hi rend="i">George <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> Shreve introduced innovations—three decks, shallow hull, the
                    hogframe, and separate engines for each paddle wheel—that made it the prototype of the
                    huge "floating palaces" that followed (p. 174).</p>
            <p>Shreve then turned his attention to the greatest hazards to the steamboat in the rivers, the snags
                    and sawyers that obstructed navigation. In 1826 he became superintendent of western river
                    improvements for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government, and he spent the remainder of his career clearing the rivers of the
                    Mississippi Valley of these hazards. His greatest challenge came with the clearing of the Great Raft
                    of the Red River, and his success led to the naming of Shreveport in his honor. Following his
                    retirement as superintendent in 1841, he spent the remainder of his life promoting the growth of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and seeking compensation from Congress for the use of the snag boats, <hi rend="i">Heliopolis</hi> (1829) and <hi rend="i">Archimedes</hi> (1831), which he had invented to clear
                    the rivers. The suit was still pending at the time of his death in 1851.</p>
            <p>Engaging as the author's narrative is, the historian will have trouble with her presentation
                    of the traditional image of Shreve. <pb n="385" id="VAA4025-080-4-091"/> In 1949 in <hi rend="i">Steamboats on the Western Rivers</hi> Louis C. Hunter challenged this view when he declared:
                    "such evidence as is available suggests that Shreve's boats, so far as major
                    structural features are concerned, did not differ materially from other steamboats of their
                    day" (p. 76). If the author has new evidence that refutes Hunter, she fails to present it.
                    Rather she footnotes sparingly and relies heavily on secondary sources published before 1949, such
                    as Emerson W. Gould's <hi rend="i">Fifty Years on the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> published in 1889. Hunter has said that the case "made in behalf of
                    Shreve is overstated" (p. 15), and this reviewer has found no evidence in McCall's
                    study to refute that judgment. On the contrary, the author's heroic presentation of Shreve
                    perpetuates the overstatement without substantial justification.</p>
            <p>In writing this book McCall set as her purpose to reveal in a combined narrative the story of the
                    opening of the inland rivers and the life of Henry Miller Shreve. In this she has succeeded. Her
                    well-written effort cannot help but renew popular interest in two highly interesting and interwoven
                    phases of American history.</p>

            <p>Robert M. Utley faces an enormous task in synthesizing the literature of the western Indian frontier.
                    Quite appropriately, he uses the Mexican War and the Massacre at Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge
                    reservation as the chronological limits of his newest book. To give unity to his narrative, Utley
                    identifies two theses around which he organizes his account. He maintains that "the
                    frontier condemned the two [Indians and Anglo-Americans] to a physical union, while a great cultural
                    chasm condemned them never really to see or understand each other" (p. xix). Disagreeing
                    with Frederick <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> Turner's concept of the frontier as a "single line," Utley
                    hypothesizes that in the American West Indians and Anglo-Americans met in "groupings of
                    frontier zones" where they mingled and changed, "in ways never really perceived as
                    attributable to the other" (p. xx). The last pages of <hi rend="i">The Indian Frontier</hi>
                    are devoted to a critique of Turner, concluding that "modern America is uniquely, as Turner
                    failed to perceive, a blend of its immigrant and native heritages" (p. 272).</p>
            <p>Yet, <hi rend="i">The Indian Frontier</hi> is principally an account of the western Indian wars.
                    Those conflicts intensified as the United <pb n="386" id="VAA4025-080-4-092"/> States government
                    attempted to restrict the movement of Indians and to place tribes on reservations. The reservation
                    policy with the government's attendant bungling, corruption, and inefficiency culminated in
                    a series of guerilla-like wars which were fought in small skirmishes and with relentless pressure by
                    slow-moving army columns. The Navajo, Cheyenne-Sioux, Kiowa-Comanche, Nez Perce, Apache, and other
                    campaigns finally drove the tribes to western reservations and dependence upon the federal
                    government for the necessities of life. President Ulysses S. Grant's peace policy and the
                    programs of the eastern "Friends of the Indians" never succeeded in transforming
                    the Native Americans into self-supporting farmers, Christians, and citizens who owned and tilled
                    individualized tracts of land. Indians were torn between two conflicting desires of whites:
                    reformers wanted to acculturate and assimilate the Indian people, but the westerners wanted Indian
                    land and resources. However sincere and well-meaning the reformers were, their policies were carried
                    out by an Indian Service riddled with greed, corruption, patronage, and incompetence.</p>
            <p>Admittedly this book was written for general readers and students, not for specialists in Indian
                    history. Utley writes lucidly, providing the reader with ample facts and deft characterizations of
                    Indian leaders, army officers, Indian Service personnel, and eastern politicians. To produce this
                    volume the author has utilized his previous books, weaving other pertinent secondary works into
                    several of his early and later chapters.</p>
            <p>Occasionally, brevity leads the author into incomplete or erroneous statements. Usage of the term
                    "Southern Comanches" connotes a political cohesiveness which never characterized
                    Comanche organization (p. 56). The Comanche divisions were autonomous, and a treaty with the
                    Penateka possessed no significance to the Nokoni or Kwahadi who shared portions of the Comanche
                    domain. The Cheyenne-Arapaho Sand Creek reservation of 1861 extended north and south of the Arkansas
                    River (p. 86). Red Cloud was not the leader of all the Oglala Sioux in 1865–1868 because
                    the tribe was divided into two groups, the Bear People and the Cloud People, with Red Cloud having
                    ascendancy among the latter (p. 100). The Cheyenne-Arapaho Darlington Agency was not located on the
                    1867 Medicine Lodge Treaty lands but on the 1869 executive order reservation (p. 173). Sale of
                    Indian allotments began well before the expiration of the twenty-five-year trust period provided in
                    the 1887 Dawes Act. <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> statutes of 1902, 1906, and 1907 led to early alienation of the Indian land base, which
                    severely jeopardized the intent of the Dawes Act <pb n="387" id="VAA4025-080-4-093"/> sponsors.
                    These limited errors, however, do not diminish the excellence of this perceptive, original, and
                    interpretive study of the western Indian frontier.</p>

            <p>On the morning of July 20, 1846, George Donner's party of eighty-two left the Oregon Trail

                    at their quickening fortunes. Tamsen was "gloomy, sad, and dispirited."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> She could not shake her fear that, by abandoning the known road and the larger

                    party died hideous deaths. Forty-seven survived, nourished in their gruesome mountain refuge by the
                    flesh of the dead. For Tamsen Donner the disjunction between fantasy and experience was fatal.</p>
            <p>Annette Kolodny, in <hi rend="i">The Land before Her,</hi> makes it possible to see Tamsen
                    Donner's apprehensions as part of a rich legacy of women's fantasies, fears, and
                    imaginary projections of the American frontier. Although Kolodny does not discuss the portentous
                    conflict between Tamsen's rationality and George's adventurism, she does find in
                    women's voices precisely the sensible fears of the unknown, the communal values, and the
                    domesticating instincts that might have restrained such "American Adams" as George
                    Donner in their reckless assault on the continental wilderness. The book begins with captivity
                    narratives from the early woodland frontiers. Women held captive by Indians experienced paralyzing
                    fear, sexual displacement, and despair in the wilderness, but almost never the seductions of the
                    forest or heroic liberation <list type="footnotes">

                    Confronted with the raw environment, women consistently expressed their preference for gardens, for
                    neighbors, for community. The middle chapters find women like Margaret Fuller and Caroline Kirkland
                    publishing their own views on forest and prairie frontiers. The voices are ambivalent,
                    simultaneously seeking new hope in the parklike grasslands and documenting the tragedies of women
                    who endured isolation, endless labor, pregnancies, and child care in cramped cabins while their
                    menfolk hunted, fished, and ravished the earth with ax and plow. The final chapters turn to a
                    flowering of hopeful expression in the domestic novels of the 1850s. Severely restricted by the
                    conventions of Victorian "domesticity," female authors seized upon the prairies as
                    settings for feminine fantasies about communities purged of such historical fruits of man's
                    aggression as industrial blight and black slavery.</p>
            <p>Kolodny insists that her book is "neither social history nor literary history, but the
                    sequence of fantasies through which generations of women came to know and act upon the
                    westward-moving frontier" (p. xii). As an explication of previously unheard voices in
                    American literature, it is a welcome gift. But Kolodny's subtitle and much of her argument
                    promise connections, between these "paradigms" of the head (p. xii) and the
                    historical landscapes of experience, that are never delivered. She links women's
                    perceptions only to the act of composing literature, but the implied connection is to pioneering
                    itself. She treats female expressions as literary triumphs precisely at the moment they lose touch
                    with reality and begin projecting their own Utopian (and life threatening) images of paradise. Thus,
                    Tamsen Donner is quoted (p. 233) as one of a new generation of females participating for the first
                    time in hopeful projections of frontier garden communities. But Tamsen Donner died in the High
                    Sierra and was probably eaten by a male survivor; she was the most extraordinary victim of the
                    continuing power and domination of reckless male fantasies of possession and conquest. Fantasy and
                    experience are in savage discord, but readers are not told so. Instead, against this awful reality
                    Kolodny sets the literary prediction that on the California and Oregon frontiers
                    "Eve" would assert a garden "wholly her own" in which
                    "Adam would become superfluous to the Homestead Eden" (p. 241). Kolodny's
                    promise of another volume to bring the fantasy "full circle" does little to
                    satisfy the reader's craving for conclusions to many provocative threads of her complex
                    argument.</p>

            <p>Polly Welts Kaufman has written a fascinating account of National Popular Education Board teachers
                    and their frontier experiences from 1847 to 1854. Catharine Beecher promoted the idea of sending
                    Board-trained, surplus eastern women to the West, which in her view had too many Catholic schools
                    and not enough Protestant teachers. Thus, Board teachers would educate roughhewn frontier pupils and
                    inculcate religious values in them. A long introduction is devoted to the Board's history,
                    and analyzes the teachers' experiences. Most of the book consists of one teacher's
                    journal and selected letters of twelve others, including Cynthia M. Bishop who taught in New Durham
                    and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Two excellent maps give geographical perspective. Statistical profiles of all
                    known Board teachers, comparisons with Mt. Holyoke alumnae, and a biographical table are appended.
                    Most of the teachers discussed in Kaufman's book taught in the Old Northwest; more than
                    fifty came to Indiana.</p>
            <p>The centerpiece of the work is Arozina Perkins's journal, a unique document that expresses
                    her sensitive personality and the culture that spawned Board teachers. Passionate religious
                    feelings, family, church, and school shaped her life. Perkins probably had no difficulty in
                    demonstrating the personal conversion experience that Beecher required of all teachers. She wanted
                    her western teaching to be a "<hi rend="i">pure</hi> and <hi rend="i">holy</hi>"
                    experience (p. 125). It was not all that she hoped it would be. Like other Board teachers, she had
                    successes and failures. Circumstances forced Bishop to temper her evangelical enthusiasm. Learning
                    that she might not be permitted to use the Bible in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s new public school, she decided to <hi rend="i">"teach the scholars
                        the</hi> golden rule &amp; many <hi rend="i">other Bible precepts, whether I tell them</hi>
                    where I found <hi rend="i">them or not"</hi> (p. 175).</p>
            <p>Board teachers were obligated to stay in the West for two years, but some of them were not able to
                    adjust to rugged and unfamiliar surroundings. Homesick and upset because they had failed, they sadly
                    wrote to the Board, explaining why they had decided to return East. Many of them remained in the
                    West, at least for a time, including Keziah Price Lister, who married the prominent Calvin Fletcher
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. A few went even farther afield in their teaching and missionary endeavors; one, for
                    example, went to <placeName>
                        <country reg="tu">Turkey</country>
                    </placeName>, and others taught freedmen after the Civil War. Whatever their fates, these women were
                    an important <pb n="390" id="VAA4025-080-4-096"/> part of the effort to extend eastern norms to the
                    West. Kaufman's book makes their experience conveniently accessible for the first time and
                    shows how women subtly and significantly contributed to Manifest Destiny.</p>

            <p>This is as much a book about the development of the American public's "pictorial
                    consciousness" in the nineteenth century as it is a tribute to the memory of Abraham <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s evolving public image between 1860 and 1869 into the larger context of the
                    development of a popular visual culture. It is this achievement that distinguishes the book from
                    what it appears to be at first glance—a glossy, expensive picture book appropriate for
                    "yuppie" coffee tables.</p>

                    presented contribution to an aspect of American cultural history that is emerging as one of the more
                    interesting new areas of interdisciplinary scholarship. It is an area that also has, or should have,
                    broad appeal beyond the scholarly community because of its relevance to contemporary discussions
                    about the decline of literacy and the ascent of pictorial communication. The years of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s presidency coincided with the period in which pictorial mass communication
                    began to have an impact on American culture, although not yet primarily by way of photography
                    because the halftone process had not been invented. It is fascinating to read (and see) how <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s public image was shaped by painters and engravers who, more often than not,
                    copied from each other and from photographs without much concern for either fidelity or honest
                    acknowledgment of their sources.</p>
            <p>A case in point is the Mathew Brady studio's handsome photograph of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and his son Tad (Fig. 82), which was the model for a wretched hand-colored lithograph
                    (Fig. 83) as well as for part of a lithograph showing the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> family gathered around a table (Fig. 84). It appears again, now in mirror reversal, as
                    part of an oil painting of the family by Francis Bicknell Carpenter (Fig. 85), which in turn was
                    made into a mezzotint engraving <pb n="391" id="VAA4025-080-4-097"/> (Fig. 86). The Brady photograph
                    can still be recognized as the source for another lithograph (Fig. 87), only now with the
                    astonishing transformation of Tad into Willie, the Lincolns' second son, who had died three
                    years before the print was issued.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s first campaign and his assassination the public's view of this
                    extraordinary-looking man underwent a dramatic change. Within six years the beardless face of young,
                    ungainly "Honest Abe the Railsplitter" was turned into a vision of the
                    apotheosized "Savior of the Country," complete with heroic emblems that hitherto
                    in American iconography had been reserved for George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> alone. This transformation tells much about the emergence of American popular pictorial
                    culture and its impact on political image making. Even the single authorial error that this reviewer
                    detected does not diminish the value of this excellent book. What the authors identify as an
                    "olive branch [held] over <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    martyrdom rather than peace. An angel holds it and a laurel wreath over <placeName>

                    explore the workings of female kinship systems in these nineteenth-century white Protestant
                    native-born families. While at least one household in each of the thirty family groups (each group
                    being composed of numerous households through several generations) lived in <placeName>

                    kin who lived elsewhere.</p>
            <p>The study is ahistorical in approach; Marilyn Ferris Motz has looked for "a pattern of
                    interactions common to the families examined" <pb n="392" id="VAA4025-080-4-098"/> and has ignored
                    "changes through time, distinctions between urban and rural households, and other
                    variations in the general patterns set forth here" (p. 8). The result is a sort of
                    monolithic nineteenth-century American family, basically unchanged from 1820 to 1920 and unaffected
                    by regional or class differences, war, industrialization, urbanization, higher education for women,
                    the temperance movement, or women's clubs. And all white native-born Protestants were

                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, in fact she continually generalizes about Michigan and American women on the basis of
                    her study.)</p>
            <p>Motz describes a world in which women were almost entirely confined to the family sphere and
                    basically were satisfied to be there. As part of an intense network of female kin, a woman,
                    according to Motz, had no yearnings for autonomy: "Since she derived security and
                    satisfaction from her familial relationships, she failed to imagine an independent existence except
                    in terms of loneliness and powerlessness" (p. 7). Along with her female kin, a woman
                    "formed the backbone of the family in the nineteenth century" (p. 128). The
                    nuclear family, by contrast with sisterhood, was a weak association: "Marriage constituted
                    only a part, in fact a relatively unstable part, of the nineteenth-century family" (p.
                    130). Although Motz alternately stresses women's power and vulnerability in this system,
                    she clearly rejects Carl Degler's conclusion that women were at odds with the family. Motz
                    argues that Degler misunderstood what "the family" meant to nineteenth-century
                    women: the family meant their female kin, and they were not at odds with their
                    sisters—only with their husbands. The family (i.e., the female kin) actually enabled
                    women to develop increasing autonomy within marriage, Motz reasons (pp. 4–5). Motz never
                    recognizes that women sometimes resented the relentless claims of female kin and a claustrophobic
                    system of family ties.</p>
            <p>While <hi rend="i">True Sisterhood</hi> pioneers in using collections of family papers to study
                    kinship networks and makes some interesting claims about women's roles in
                    nineteenth-century families, Motz fails to marshall her evidence convincingly.</p>

                    trans-Appalachian colleges. Hermann R. Muelder—Knox alumnus, historian, dean, and acting
                    president—has written what in many ways is a very competent history of the institution.
                    Unfortunately, however, he omitted the period of his professional involvement because of a fear that
                    he would bias the account; thus, he chose to end his narrative with the centennial year 1937.
                    Perhaps he was following the example of the preceding Knox historian, Earnest Elmo Calkins, who,
                    writing in 1937, limited his narrative of Knox and the surrounding <placeName>

               </hi>) to the nineteenth century. One wishes that Muelder had followed the pattern
                    of several historian-administrators (e.g., Wilson Lyon of Pomona and Pay-son Wild of Northwestern)
                    who have written objective and comprehensive institutional histories.</p>
            <p>Muelder's volume especially emphasizes: 1) students in general; 2) the careers of well-known
                    literary alumni such as Eugene Field, Edgar Lee Masters, magazine publisher and editor Samuel
                    McClure, and <placeName>

                        Anthology</hi>); and 4) the relationship of the college to the larger society (e.g., the
                    involvement of the college in abolitionism, the role of its alumni in stimulating Progressive Era
                    reforms, and the influence of the students in introducing and developing the popular intercollegiate
                    oratorical competition). By contrast, the author shows less concern with the details of
                    institutional administration and finance and curricular development and classroom activities; also
                    he largely ignores educational philosophy and the secularization process.</p>
            <p>There is much about this book to commend. Muelder's research is thorough, he writes with an
                    engaging style, he often relates the necessary factual details dynamically through the lives of
                    leading characters in the story, and he avoids the parochial orientation of many college histories.

            <p>Lela B. Costin's informative biography of Grace and Edith Abbott details the public careers
                    of two sisters who were in the vanguard of social justice reform efforts in the first four decades
                    of the twentieth century. Grace directed the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Immigrants' Protective League from 1907 to 1917 and worked with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Children's Bureau, first as director of the Child Labor Division from 1917 to
                    1919 and then as head of the bureau from 1921 to 1934. Edith, who had a Ph.D. in economics, edited
                    the <hi rend="i">Social Service Review</hi> and was instrumental in the formation and development of
                    the School of Social Service Administration at the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Through her insistence that social work education be based on social science research,
                    not narrow practical training in fieldwork, she influenced social work programs throughout the
                    country. Writing a dual biography complicated Costin's task, but it was the right decision
                    because the efforts and vast accomplishments of Edith and Grace Abbott were inextricably linked.</p>
            <p>Costin skillfully traces the evolution and maturation of their extraordinary professional
                    relationship. During their ten years at Hull House, beginning in 1908, the sisters shaped and
                    perfected their partnership. Edith, the scholar, was an inexhaustible researcher who gathered the
                    facts and provided an "exact base of knowledge for their common endeavors" (p.
                    98). Grace, the activist, used this knowledge as an administrator and advocate for the rights of
                    immigrants, workers, children, and mothers. Both demonstrated an ability to place problems in their
                    broadest social context. When Grace moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D.C., in 1917, Edith continued to provide data on a range of topics related to
                    Grace's often frustrating work in the federal government. As the partnership matured and
                    the sisters' influence grew in the 1920s, they became increasingly effective in using the
                    "resources of government and higher education to get the most out of each" (p.
                    162).</p>
            <p>Their efforts during the 1920s provide evidence of the importance of women in continuing the crusade
                    for social justice reforms, but Costin indicates that it was in the last years of the Herbert Hoover
                    administration and the early years of the New Deal that their combined expertise proved most
                    valuable. Persistent and influential critics of Hoover's voluntarism, they documented <pb n="395" id="VAA4025-080-4-101"/> "the extent and nature of the suffering, and used
                    every opportunity to speak and write about the need for federal aid and public policy which would
                    make possible a modern system of social security" (p. 204). Although lifelong Republicans,
                    they welcomed the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt. As realists, the Abbotts believed that
                    New Deal legislation, however imperfect, represented a significant departure from the past.
                    Grace's activities were circumscribed by serious illness. She resigned from the
                    Children's Bureau in 1934, but her thoughts on several issues had an important impact on
                    Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins. With the expansion of the public welfare system,
                    Edith's work with the School of Social Service Administration received national
                    recognition. Welfare administrators sought her recommendations for filling their staff needs, and
                    she was thus able to "advance her concept of social work in the public sector by educating
                    and sending out staff all over the country" (p. 229).</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Two Sisters for Social Justice</hi> succeeds as a study of the public lives of Grace and
                    Edith Abbott; it is less illuminating on their personal lives. Despite several comments on their
                    character traits, neither emerges as complete personalities. For example, there are many references
                    to Edith's research, but there is very little on the actual content of her investigations
                    or the nature of the personal satisfaction she derived from this work. Costin relates the
                    sisters' lives to recent scholarship on the history of women only in the preface. She notes
                    that the Abbotts, unlike Jane Addams, were professional experts who challenged conventional images
                    of women, but she does not develop this question of divergent female identities in the remainder of
                    the biography. Costin also remarks in the preface that both sisters supported the need for
                    protective legislation for women workers. Since this was the critical divisive issue among women in
                    the 1920s, it is curious that it never reappears in the biography. Finally, neither married and both
                    had close female friendships, but Costin fails to explore the nature of the female support network
                    that sustained both sisters. Costin has written a good biography; more attention to other works on
                    women's history and to the private lives of the Abbott sisters would have made this an even
                    stronger book.</p>

            <p>Michael Homel, in this book about black Chicagoans and the public schools, shows a facility for
                    understanding the role of schools <pb n="396" id="VAA4025-080-4-102"/> in society. Labeling them
                    conserving institutions, rather than leaders in reordering social attitudes and relationships, is
                    consistent with many sociological interpretations of education in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Although the separate and unequal education system in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> was developed through administrative manipulation rather than legislation, it grew in
                    much the same fashion as systems in other cities where the creation of segregated schools was
                    enacted by law.</p>
            <p>Homel covers much territory in this small volume but does so with great care. Only because the book
                    deals with a relatively brief period is he able substantially to document such a broad list of
                    topics: funding, facilities, home, community, classroom, and black activism. He dramatically shows
                    how factors from each of these categories contributed to inequality for black children in the public
                    education system of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Even though Homel paints a bleak picture of education for blacks "between the
                    wars," he makes a point that many have missed while conducting similar studies in
                            <placeName>

                            their sensitivity to racial injustice and stimulated civic action that promoted group

                    organization's leaders to "identify and articulate issues that had mass
                    appeal" usually made the difference in the intensity of involvement by each organization.
                    As in other communities, many attempts at activism failed at the grassroots, usually getting no
                    farther than an organizational effort at a local level or, at best, the local black newspaper.</p>

            <p>I recall reading, some years ago, Robert Caro's <hi rend="i">The Power Broker: Robert Moses
                        and the Fall of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> (1975) and wishing that someone would write a similar study of the creation of
                    the modern westside and southside ghettos in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. That wish has been fulfilled. While Arnold R. Hirsch's painstakingly
                    researched <hi rend="i">Making the Second Ghetto: Race and Housing in <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                        </placeName>, 1940–1960</hi> lacks the journalistic flair of Caro's work,
                    Hirsch is to be commended for this solid contribution to urban studies. I grew up on the westside of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the tumultuous decade of the 1960s; thus, this volume possessed a special
                    personal and professional poignancy. There always existed, among the residents of the westside
                    ghetto, a nagging suspicion that forces beyond their control were shaping and controlling their
                    lives. Their suspicions were, it now appears, quite justified.</p>
            <p>Hirsch focuses on the interplay of white social, political, ethnic, and economic forces that
                    converged to create vast concentrations of poverty-stricken blacks living within carefully defined
                    geographic boundaries. To be sure, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s second black ghettos as created and shaped during the post-World War II
                    years owe their existence not to a single dominant Moses-type personality. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> there existed clusters of private and public sector influences such as the University
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, white "ethnics," corrupt political machine bosses, and business
                    elites who, for different reasons and motivations, employed diverse tactics to achieve the same
                    objectives of keeping black Chicagoans powerless and of preserving residential segregation. Hirsch
                    asserts that "the implication of government in the second ghetto was so pervasive, so deep,
                    that it virtually constituted a new form of de jure segregation" (p. 255).
                    Hirsch's concentration on the whites who made the ghetto, rather than the blacks who
                    endured it, expands understanding of the relationship between segregated housing, political power,
                    and racial antipathies.</p>
            <p>Most recent studies in black urban history end with the coming of World War II. Hirsch, by examining
                    the post-World War II city, has boldly moved ahead into new, unexplored territory. In so doing he
                    has unearthed numerous race riots of the 1940s <pb n="398" id="VAA4025-080-4-104"/> and 1950s
                    overshadowed by the disturbances of the 1960s. His complex analysis of the inner city
                    "ethnics" who used violence to prevent racial succession, of the intellectual
                    origins of urban renewal and redevelopment, and of the manipulation of politics and government will
                    undoubtedly generate new and exciting discussions among urban historians. Indeed, his discussion of
                    the strategic uses of white violence is especially provocative. The numerous photographs scattered
                    throughout the volume add to its overall tone. <hi rend="i">Making the Second Ghetto</hi> is an
                    important book full of original insight and is well worth reading.</p>

            <p>Edward Pessen, a prominent historian of nineteenth-century American urban elites, in <hi rend="i">The
                        Log Cabin Myth</hi> investigates the family backgrounds, marriages, and prepresidential career
                    patterns of this country's thirty-nine chief executives. Employing class categories
                    introduced by W. Lloyd Warner and his associates over forty years ago, he concludes that American
                    presidents came from economic and social backgrounds considerably more privileged than those of
                    upwards of 90 percent of their fellow citizens. The following is Pessen's scorecard: upper
                    upper class (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    </placeName> Adams, William Henry Harrison, Tyler, Taylor, Benjamin Harrison, Theodore Roosevelt,
                    Taft, F#2 D. Roosevelt); between the upper and lower upper classes (Polk and Kennedy); lower upper
                    class (John Adams, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName>, Wilson); between the lower upper and upper middle classes (Pierce, Hayes, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Harding, Coolidge, Truman); upper middle class (<placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
               </placeName> Buren,
                    Buchanan, Grant, Arthur, McKinley, Hoover, Lyndon Johnson, Ford, Carter); middle class (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Eisenhower, Reagan); lower middle class (Fillmore, Garfield, Nixon); and upper lower
                    class (Andrew Johnson).</p>
            <p>Pessen notes that this frequency distribution suggests "the slightly more plebian starting
                    points of latter-day presidents" (p. 72). He attributes this development "to the
                    slightly greater chances more available to persons born into the lower levels of the <hi rend="i">upper</hi> social clusters" (p. 72). The author underestimates the egalitarian trend
                    of his findings. Of the seven presidents since F#2 D. Roosevelt, two originated in the middle class
                    and one came from the lower middle class. These seven chief executives constitute 18 percent of the
                    thirty-nine who held that office; yet, the post-World War II leaders account for two thirds of the
                    presidents from <pb n="399" id="VAA4025-080-4-105"/> middle-class antecedents, one third of those
                    from lower-middle-class beginnings, and three of the seven among the thirty-nine born into families
                    of middle or lower social rank. Kennedy alone of the post-1945 presidents indisputably belongs in
                    Pessen's upper-class categories.</p>
            <p>As played by the author, presidential stratification is not a difficult game. He gathers information
                    mostly from biographies of the presidents (see "Bibliographical Note," pp.
                    186–89) and does not document the individual assignments. Despite superficial research,
                    sloppy methodology, and the possibility that other scholars might rearrange some of the class
                    designations, Pessen correctly contends that the majority of these figures came from advantaged
                    backgrounds. Indeed, he repetitively asserts that <hi rend="i">The Log Cabin Myth</hi> explodes the
                    pervasive misconception of scholars and the public that government leaders stemmed from humble or
                    middle-class roots. This claim properly belongs to the literary genre of dust jacket puffery. How
                    necessary is a book that tells historians what they already know? The book also lacks substantial
                    evidence that the public overwhelmingly misperceives presidential lineage.</p>
            <p>The second main theme in <hi rend="i">The Log Cabin Myth,</hi> that political parties select
                    presidential candidates for their sound (i.e., conservative) views, is as unexceptionable and banal
                    as the thesis that these nominees come from the upper strata. However, Pessen draws dubious
                    conclusions from his assumption about party nominations. He claims that men of wealth and high
                    social standing are nominated for the presidency because they are more likely to defend the
                    established order than are those from lower levels, whom the parties might otherwise prefer since
                    they would be more electable candidates as self-made men. Finally, Pessen declares that the choice
                    of well-born men signifies that "the people who rule are not <hi rend="i">the
                        people"</hi> (p. 183). In reality, there are plenty of potential candidates of humble
                    stock who are conservative. The fact is that for most voters the pedigrees of presidential nominees
                    do not seem important. Hence, it is doubtful that these candidates are unrepresentative of the will
                    of the electorate.</p>
            <p>The chief distinction of <hi rend="i">The Log Cabin Myth</hi> lies in its being slender in size and
                    thin in substance, yet inflated in its claim to originality and padded by repetitive biographical

            <p>One of the greatest, if not the greatest, players in baseball history was Ty Cobb, major league
                    outfielder from 1905 to 1928. A native of the red-clay country of northern <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> and son of a locally prominent educator, he moved into the world of sports before he
                    was twenty. During nearly all his career, he wore the uniform of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> Tigers and set innumerable records as a hitter and base stealer. Only recently have
                    some of them been broken or closely approached. Owing to shrewd investments, such as stocks in Coca
                    Cola and General Motors, more than to compensation from the Tigers (very modest by modern
                    standards), he retired as a multimillionaire. This long period to 1961 brought him more trouble than
                    happiness, as his unstable temperament alienated family and friends and detached him from the sport
                    he loved.</p>
            <p>Charles Alexander has produced a well-researched, well-written biography, quite superior to the usual
                    book about athletes. A skilled historian, he has gathered evidence wherever
                    available—from relevant manuscripts at the National Baseball Library at Cooperstown and
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Library, from interviews and a wide range of publications. But newspapers
                    provide most of his information, which is apparent in full descriptions, season by season, of
                    Cobb's sensational feats on the diamond. Though the author's literary style is
                    very good, this sort of narrative does become a little tedious and cluttered with detail.
                    Nonetheless, Alexander portrays a fascinating personality: ruthless, combative, intelligent, a
                    veritable perfectionist. Given to fights and controversies at the slightest provocation, Cobb had
                    few close associations, but his incredible prowess and never-fading color excited an enormous
                    popular interest. Here Alexander seeks to explain this social dimension by relating Cobb to early
                    twentieth-century America; and to the limited extent he succeeds, his volume will have a fairly
                    broad appeal. One has the feeling that he, or others consulting his work, could do still more.</p>

            <p>Michael Spindler's book is offered as an interdisciplinary study, an exercise in what he
                    calls "the sociology of American literature" (p. 7). His concern, broadly
                    speaking, is with the interrelationships between American economic, social, and literary life in the
                    period roughly from Reconstruction to the 1950s, and he has selected seven writers for detailed
                    study: William Dean Howells, Frank Norris, Theodore Dreiser, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis,
                    John Dos Passos, and Arthur Miller. His method is to describe American social development (and thus,
                    for him, literary development) in terms of the Marxist formulation of base and superstructure. This
                    procedure conveniently yields two phases of American social and economic history, the first which
                    Spindler calls "The Production-Oriented Phase" and the second which he labels
                    "The Consumption-Oriented Phase." The former includes the works of Howells,
                    Norris, and Dreiser, the latter those of Dreiser (again), Fitzgerald, Lewis, Dos Passos, and Miller.</p>
            <pb n="402" id="VAA4025-080-4-108"/>
            <p>Spindler is determined to show how the "ideological confusions and contradictions"
                    (p. 47) endemic to American social history have molded its literature, and his account of the
                    genesis of a literary work, therefore, is deterministic and reductive. For example, he says of
                    Norris and Dreiser that they "played down the significance of form and fashioned a
                    coarse-grained prose that corresponded well with the rough, coarse-grained texture of their subjects
                    … the bitter strikes and harsh conditions did not require the delicate nuances of
                    Jamesian prose but a new rhetoric suitable to the thrusting crudity and angularity of industrial
                    society" (p. 47). Now, the cynical reader might see all this as special pleading on behalf
                    of writers who are simply far less talented than Henry James. Where, indeed, given the fact that
                    "played down" suggests conscious choice, is the evidence that Norris and Dreiser
                    were capable of writing any other kind of prose? Of John Dos Passes, Spindler says: "he
                    realised that the conventional realist novel was inadequate to the portrayal of the texture of
                    modern social experience and to the rendering of a definite historical interpretation" (p.
                    200). But where, again, in the early part of his career, is there any evidence that Dos Passes <hi rend="i">could</hi> have written conventional realistic novels if he had wanted to? To say that
                    Dos Passos fashioned a new form of discontinuous narrative in the face of the complexity of modern
                    industrial experience might simply be to say that he had no gift for narrative. In fact, in the
                    later stages of his literary career Dos Passos did evince a talent, albeit a very limited one, for
                    the conventional novel, but these are works that Spindler probably finds
                    "ideologically" offensive.</p>
            <p>Spindler's is not a critical book, but it does not claim to be one. His readings, however,
                    are not as innovative as he thinks them to be (see p. 6). Far too often the sociological and
                    historical aspects of his book seem detachable components merely used to bolster conventional
                    observations; nowhere is this more apparent than in the introductory chapters to his two
                    "phases," entitled "Hardware" and "Software."
                    He is not, moreover, the most accurate of historians, especially of intellectual matters. He says,
                    for example, that, for the Puritans, "the decision Chosen or Damned was based on
                    performance in the never-ending struggle between good and evil" (p. 31), thus imputing to
                    them a doctrine of good works which is not evident in their writings.</p>
            <p>Despite these weaknesses, Spindler's book is not wholly without merit. On the whole, it is
                    clearly written, and the chapters on Dreiser's <hi rend="i">An American Tragedy</hi> and
                    Miller's <hi rend="i">Death of a Salesman</hi> can be especially recommended. But it is not
                    the ground-breaking contribution to the sociology of American literature that Spindler claims it to
                    be, and, in fact, on the evidence of the methodology used here, one wonders if there ever will be
                    one.</p>
