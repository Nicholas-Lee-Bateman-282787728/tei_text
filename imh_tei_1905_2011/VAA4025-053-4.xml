            <p>"The great day of which I have, since boyhood, been dreaming is nearly upon us,"
                    noted Albert J. Beveridge shortly after the beginning of the conflict with <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> in 1898." For many years I have been talking, writing and speaking of the time
                    when the Republic must embark upon its imperial policy… . But now, all at once, the
                    fierce light of war reveals to the American people that this policy which I felt would be delayed
                    for years is upon us, and so it is that, for the first time in my life, I wish I were in public
                    position where I could partly shape the events which are now upon us." But distant from the
                    seats of power, he feared lest he idly sit, a spectator from afar upon the course of events.
                    "It may be," Beveridge added hopefully, "that there is still a sufficient
                    lack of statesmanship to defer this thing eight or ten years," and in that case he should
                    have his chance at shaping the national destiny.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But events moved faster than Beveridge dreamed, for he had the self-discipline and impatience of
                    ambition, the will and energy that bred success. A plow boy at twelve, a railroad hand with a
                    section gang at fourteen, a logger and teamster at sixteen, Beveridge had from youth been inspired
                    by dreams of greatness, by an unquenchable faith in his future. Believing that knowledge meant power
                    in this struggle of life, he graduated from DePauw University in 1885 on his first step upward into
                    the world of affairs. Paying his way through college by dint of sacrifice and struggle, <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="356" id="VAA4025-053-4-006"/> Beveridge found that the hardships of his youth had prepared
                    the foundations for the achievements of his mature years. Throughout his future career he displayed
                    that strength of purpose which doubted not his powers. "This absolutely certain
                    inevitableness of my prevailing," Beveridge noted reflectively in his uncompleted
                    autobiography, "… has been a power in my life a faith elemental, primordial,
                    even fanatic if you like."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The choice of a career at the law came naturally enough. "Lawyers were the biggest men in
                    our own and neighboring counties," recalled Beveridge, "and they were regarded as
                    a very superior type of human being." In the fluid society of a rapidly industrializing
                    America, law provided the smoothest avenue along which a man without capital could rise to wealth
                    and power, and Beveridge followed that path trod by so many ambitious youths of the day. "I
                    would give my clients the very best that was in me," he resolved on beginning independent
                    practice in 1899. "I would put my life into every case."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                    Thorough preparation, a phenomenal memory, and a remarkable ability to master detail made him
                    devastating in the court room, and Beveridge climbed rapidly to a position of leadership at the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>But politics remained Beveridge's first love, and even before leaving college he had
                    ventured forth into the political fray. "I was a partisan Republican of that white hot kind
                    that in those days resulted from being the son and brother of Union soldiers," he recalled.
                    Hailing Republican victory as a mark of loyalty to the Union and to the men who fought and died for
                    its preservation, Beveridge scornfully denounced <list type="footnotes">

                    his devotion to the Grand Old Party. America was rich and fast growing richer. No nation in the
                    world offered such opportunities, and his own personal experience seemed but confirmation of this
                    truth. Rejoicing in the multiplying proofs of the nation's wealth, he suffered few of the
                    nagging doubts afflicting the millions whom this prosperity had not so benefited. Life had been good
                    to him, and Beveridge, favored by fortune, discerned no radical flaw in the acquisitive America of
                    the years following the Civil War.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

                    civilization itself."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> So in every campaign, beginning from the 1884 Elaine-<placeName>

                    of the G.O.P. He was ever a partisan, lush, prolix, uncurbed in his exuberance, too profuse in
                    eulogies of his party, too bitter with its opponents. But an age finding its model in the

            <p>Popularity as a Republican stump speaker drew speaking invitations from beyond Indiana, and by 1898
                    Beveridge had gained a national reputation. But more importantly, that campaign activity opened a
                    path to political preferment. So well known had Beveridge become politically that the party leaders
                    proffered him the 1894 Republican nomination for the highly lucrative attorney-generalship of the
                    state. Based upon the fee system rather than a regular salary, this office <list type="footnotes">

                    was tempted by so glittering a prize. But fearful lest that place be considered full reward for all
                    the services he had done in the past and all he could do in the future, he finally declined the
                    honor. "It is firing my gun off too soon," Beveridge concluded. "I think
                    that there may be something higher ahead for me—but I shall not care even for that unless

            <p>The outburst of the Spanish-American war fired his dreams of political leadership. Destiny, Beveridge
                    felt, had marked him to guide the nation's imperial future. "For myself, if fate
                    could lay before me the choice of a place in history as a free gift of the gods," he
                    exclaimed, "I would rather be the forming and shap[ing mind] which is to mark out our
                    foreign policy from now on than to have been the greatest statesman of the period of the Civil War.
                    For, after all, the latter will be more or less local; the former will be universal."10 The <placeName>

                            years was not as unchallenged as the above statement seemingly indicates. The Republicans
                            did win the Indiana House of Representatives in 1886, and two years later elected the
                            governor and carried the state for Benjamin Harrison for president, although the Democrats
                            managed until 1894 to control the General Assembly on joint ballot for the election of U.S.
                            Senators. For a good summary of the politics of these years, see Seeds, <hi rend="i">History

            <p>At a meeting toward the end of May, 1898, in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> law office of James W. Noel, a close personal friend, Beveridge's candidacy
                    had its beginnings. Present were Noel, Frank Littleton, Larz Whitcomb, and Alfred M. Gloss-brenner,
                    longtime friends of the hopeful candidate to whom Beveridge bluntly announced his dream of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senatorship. His friends were stunned for the moment by the daring of the scheme, but
                    after considerable discussion boldness proved their ally. During the previous session of the
                    legislature, Littleton had served with such distinction in the Indiana House of Representatives that
                    he had planned to seek renomination in the hope of reaching the speakership. Now, following the
                    discussion, Noel, Whitcomb, and Gloss-brenner determined to run for that body in the dual plan of
                    contributing to the selection of Littleton to the speakership and of Beveridge to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate. A few days later they persuaded Fred Joss, another young lawyer of their
                    acquaintance, to seek a seat in the Indiana Senate in furtherance of their design.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>Beveridge had made no mistake in his choice of followers. Though youthful, these friends of Beveridge

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            </p>
            <p>In furthering these plans, Beveridge realized that the chairmanship of the Republican state
                    convention to be held that August promised an unrivaled chance for placing his name prominently
                    before the party faithful gathered from throughout the state. His advisers, he explained to a
                    friendly politician, "regard it of great importance that I meet the sixteen hundred
                    delegates face to face in the active work of presiding over the Convention."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> But that chance was denied him. "Fairbanks insisted on being the whole
                    thing," Beveridge complained, and the Senator presided in person during the entire session.
                    "Had I conducted the Convention today," he lamented, "I would have, in
                    this single day, done seventy-five percent of the work which will be on our shoulders this Fall and
                    Winter." A serious setback, Beveridge felt, and "my fellows here are furious and
                    bitterly so."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Beveridge and his friends remained undaunted and quietly continued their activity. "We
                    ought to go slow and not get any more people in this thing just now," urged a confidant in
                    early September.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> That should be the plan, Beveridge acknowledged, but he
                    warned that his friends must continue their behind-the-scenes activity.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Nor
                    did Beveridge on his campaign tours in the fall for the Republican ticket neglect to sound the
                    situation. "Men come to me every day," he reported, "and voluntarily
                    pledge themselves to me without my stating to them that I am in any wise a candidate."<hi rend="sup">21</hi> "If things go on as they are," he exclaimed jubilantly,

                    boldness of his course. Barely thirty-six years of age, he struck many as unduly ambitious. Let him

                    against his candidacy were formidable, but he had that supreme self-confidence which inspired his
                    followers. "I note your `hope'," he replied to a friend. "As
                    Hamlet says, `Nay it is not seems, it is.' So in this matter, it is not a question of
                    `hope'; it is a question of `will be.' Please remember Beaconsfield's

            <p>Beveridge's candidacy had its handicaps, and foremost appeared to be his lack of support
                    among the more prominent leaders of the state.32 But in reality that proved a blessing in disguise
                    considering the bitter factional rivalry prevailing within the Republican party at the time. A
                    deep-seated split, this ill feeling had its beginning in the candidacy of Benjamin Harrison for the
                    1888 presidential nomination. Most Indiana Republicans followed the lead of John C. New, publisher

                    Republicanism, the Harrison group included the dominant party leadership of that day. But
                    Harrison's foremost rival, Judge Walter Q. Gresham, lacked not his Indiana supporters, and
                    a fierce struggle ensued for control of the party machinery. A politically ambitious young attorney,
                    Charles W. Fairbanks, led the Gresham forces, and, ably assisted by a group of rising young
                    politicians, laid the foundations for a rival political <list type="footnotes">

                            Perry Heath, First Assistant Postmaster-General and McKinley's chief patronage
                            dispenser, Beveridge to George W. Perkins, July 14, 1898, Beveridge Papers. But there is
                            good reason to believe that Heath was simply using Beveridge as a stalking horse for his own
                            ambitions. In the words of his chief clerk, Heath was" not disposed, just now, to
                            make an open avowal of his candidacy. If he can hold some members uncommitted for a while
                            that will be sufficient," George Allen to David W. Henry, November 22, 1898, Henry
                            Papers, Indiana State Library. Eventually, Beveridge suspected the double game Heath was
                            playing, and sharply demanded that he squelch those persistent rumors about his availability
                            and" come back here and take his coat off like the rest of our mutual friends for
                            me," Beveridge to Charles G. Dawes, November 29, 1898, Beveridge Papers. But the
                            evidence does not indicate that Heath in any way played a significant part in
                            Beveridge's selection.</item>

                    Fairbanks remained undis-couraged, and awaited his day as he quietly spread his personal following
                    throughout the state. Despite the federal patronage in the hands of his foes, Fairbanks had matured
                    his plans so carefully that by 1892 he had become a power to be reckoned with in Indiana politics.

                    that year provided the chance for which he had been preparing. Displaced from their federal

                    Fairbanks, spending freely of his personal fortune to rebuild the party, had by 1894 grasped the
                    reins of Indiana Republican leadership.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>

                    Gowdy, from the chairmanship of the Republican State Committee failed by a narrow margin,<hi rend="sup">35</hi> and Fairbanks promptly sought to reinsure his future dominance by hastening

                    in his hands, reigned supreme over Indiana Republicanism. Discredited and purged, the Harrison

            <p>In light of this situation the Beveridge hopes were apparent. The bitterest feeling had been roused,

                    Beveridge's chance. In the 1888 pre-nomination campaign, he had rallied behind the Gresham
                    standard, doing yeoman work in that losing cause.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> But during the years which
                    followed, Beveridge remained aloof from the Fairbanks forces, and, falling under the influence of

            <p>Perhaps more importantly, Beveridge's youthfulness had its advantages for his candidacy.
                    Running as the self-styled representative of the rising generation of Republicans, he had a
                    particular appeal for the younger members of the party. "I don't know what to
                    think of the Beveridge situation," reported an experienced politician to a rival candidate.

            <p>At the same time, nothing contributed so much to give an air of solidity to Beveridge's
                    candidacy as the mobilization of a number of leading business men behind him. His speeches had long
                    been in harmony with business aspirations, and now a group of substantial <placeName>

                    </placeName> manufacturers, merchants, and bankers formed a Business Men's Association for
                    Beveridge. At first confined to the city, the group decided to extend its organization throughout
                    the state. Under the leadership of David M. Parry, president of the Manufacturers'
                    Association of Indiana and vice-president of the National Association of Manufacturers, a meeting of
                    more than one hundred business leaders from all parts of Indiana was held on December 28. The group
                    voted endorsement of Beveridge's candidacy for the Senate as best serving the interests of
                    the business community, and plans were laid for providing further support.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>

            <p>A few days later, on January 3, as the legislators began flocking into the city, Beveridge's
                    business friends formally opened their headquarters at the Denison to canvass on his behalf.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> From their efforts followed a steady stream of pro-Beveridge appeals flooding

                            like D. M. Parry, the biggest cart manufacturer in the world; C. F. Smith, one of the
                            greatest bicycle manufacturers in the world; the managers of our big department stores,

            <p>The General Assembly convened January 15, 1899, and the rival candidates for the Senatorship
                    struggled for advantage as the day of reckoning drew near. The speakership of the Indiana House of
                    Representatives posed the initial question mark, and rumors freely circulated that supporters of
                    rival aspirants planned a switch to Beveridge's friend, Frank Littleton. Bestowing too many

            <p>The political maneuvering of Beveridge's rivals insured Littleton's selection by

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> candidate's hopes remained undimmed by the plots of his foes.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> Perhaps, indeed, they had forwarded his chances. The disadvantages of the two candidacies
                    had been considered from the start, recalled an insider, and Beveridge's friends concluded
                    that Littleton's selection promised a decided gain for their cause. The speakership of the
                    Indiana House of Representatives, with its power and influence over committees and the like, meant
                    in the hands of a Beveridge adherent an advantage scarcely to be overlooked in any calculation.<hi rend="sup">66</hi>

            <p>As the day of the Republican caucus drew near with the Beveridge forces showing a surprising staying

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    Senator's chances should Beveridge triumph.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> Nor was it a secret that
                    Fairbanks himself regarded Beveridge's candidacy with something less than enthusiasm.<hi rend="sup">68</hi> In these circumstances, many saw his clever hand behind the White House
                    announcement, on the day of the caucus, of the nomination of Addison C. Harris, another <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            </p>
            <p>That nomination, charged Beveridge's friends, had been deliberately designed to heighten the

                    of injuring Beveridge's candidacy. "Harris' nomination," he
                    insisted, "had no more connection with the Senatorial situation than to use an old figure
                    `a last year's bird nest.' The President sends nominations to the Senate to suit
                    himself—all depends upon the burden that is upon him." "In a short
                    time," the Senator continued, "I could have interfered with B's chances

            <p>That he triumphed over the seemingly insurmountable odds against his candidacy, however, Beveridge
                    owed less to his personal strength than to the continued factional rivalry within the Republican
                    ranks. Control of the party lay at stake, and neither side could allow its rival to prevail. The
                    lines were drawn, and the hostile groupings prepared for their showdown. Behind the candidacy of the
                    most formidable contender, J. Frank Hanly, stood the full strength of the Fairbanks machine. Against
                    Hanly's candidacy, the Harrison men, hoping for a comeback, rallied their forces to seek
                    the defeat of their longtime foes. But they soon found their own hopes dimmed by the presence in the

                    it carefully and said that he knew of no reason why he should be neutral in this matter, that while
                    he could not go out and seek men to try to influence them, yet he should not hesitate to express
                    himself freely to any who would come or be brought to him in favor of your candidacy."<hi rend="sup">78</hi> A longtime Harrison partisan, Roscoe O. Hawkins, provided skillful leadership

                            Steele's candidacy, and Coffin, "The Senatorial Career of Albert J.
                            Beveridge," 156–157, 161, accepts this rumor as correct. Apparent
                            confirmation appears provided by a note among the Harry S. New Papers at the Library of
                            Congress, dated July 11, 1929, explaining certain items, in which New claims that he had
                            been an original Fairbanks man and had believed that Fairbanks' interests could be
                            best served by the selection of Steele or Taylor, both of whom were supposedly true friends
                            of the Senator's. Mr. New, however, was not altogether candid in this note. Not
                            merely does this statement run counter to the overwhelming preponderance of evidence, as
                            presented above, about the actual state of factional feeling at the time, but it is directly
                            contradicted by New himself. Writing to Robert S. Taylor, November 16, 1904, Taylor Papers,
                            concerning his own bid for the Senate seat made vacant by Fairbanks' election as
                            Vice-President, New commented that "the same elements that opposed you so

                            that line. Beveridge, aware of the rumors, remarked on the "political
                            paradox" that Riley McKeen, an old Harrison man and Fairbanks' foremost
                            rival for the Senate in 1897, would be in the Steele combine if Steele were really

                            The paradox proved more apparent than real, for neither Steele, nor certainly Taylor, nor

                            directed now against McCulloch as a Gowdy protégé had become so bitter
                            as to threaten party chances that fall, and consequently it was decided necessary that
                            McCulloch retire in favor of the more neutral Hernly. During the 1899 senatorial campaign,
                            according to an insider, Hernly took no sides, Remy, "The Election of Beveridge to

                            himself was secretly its owner, most probably the story was planted to diminish hostility to
                            Hanly as Fairbanks' man. At the same time, Taylor sought advantage from the rumor
                            by appealing for support from the unwary on the ground that Hanly had formed a new political
                            machine hostile to Fairbanks, Robert S. Taylor to M.C. Garber, December 30, 1898, Taylor
                            Papers. But this pretended solicitude on Taylor's part for Fairbanks'
                            welfare certainly did not reflect his true feelings. Nor had Hanly constructed a new
                            machine; rather his support came, as the evidence presented above conclusively demonstrates,
                            from that same machine which Fairbanks himself had constructed by the judicious distribution
                            of patronage. At the same time, Hanly's foremost opponents were Harrison men who
                            had been longtime opponents of the Fairbanks leadership of the party, Harry New and Roscoe

                    forces held firm, and Beveridge, slowly gaining, held second place as ballot followed ballot. Then
                    on the ninth ballot came the moment of crisis when Hanly reached the thirty-seven votes fixed as the
                    danger point beyond which his foes dared not allow him to gain lest the bandwagon psychology sweep
                    him to victory.<hi rend="sup">109</hi> "At that stage," Harry New recalled,
                    "it had become perfectly apparent to me that the choice must be made between Hanly and
                    Beveridge." Hurried consultations among the anti-Hanly leaders determined their course, and
                    now the carefully prepared plans unfolded. The scene had been set, and all stood in readiness for
                    that final count naming Albert J. Beveridge the Republican choice for the <placeName>

            <p>During the balloting, Beveridge remained in his law office on <placeName>

                    </placeName> Street with a few friends, and Frank Littleton telephoned in the results from the
                    caucus. That he received only thirteen votes on the first ballot stunned Beveridge for the moment. A
                    disloyal pair from that group which had pledged their firm support to Beveridge the night before
                    deserted to the Hanly side, and Beveridge hearing this feared lest his chance had fled.<hi rend="sup">111</hi> But as the voting continued, his slowly rising strength restored that
                    supreme confidence in his destiny which had sustained his campaign against seemingly insuperable
                    odds. "That amounts to nothing," he insisted during the fluctuations of the
                    voting. "I'll be nominated."</p>
            <p>"Gentlemen, I am nominated," Beveridge calmly announced to his friends when the
                    final count confirmed his faith. Then he hastened to call his wife to give her the news.
                    "Kitty," he cried, "I am nominated, thank God." Reaching his
                    headquarters at the Denison, Beveridge found a cheering crowd of welcome, and, followed by his
                    supporters, proceeded to the State House where sat the caucus awaiting the Senator-designate.<hi rend="sup">112</hi> "Appreciation is a poor word for the honor that you have conferred
                    upon me," he spoke, "obligation does not adequately describe the duty which your
                    kindness has placed upon me." "I have no words to thank you," the new
                    Senator exclaimed. "Words fail me."<hi rend="sup">113</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beveridge's formal election came a week later, on Tuesday, January 17. The two houses of the
                    General Assembly meeting separately proceeded on that day to cast their vote for the next Senator
                    from Indiana. The Republican majority in each chamber, following the will of the caucus, cast their
                    votes for Beveridge; the Democratic minority honored the incumbent, David Turpie, with their votes;
                    and Populist Alonzo Burkhart found a single supporter in the Senate. The following day, at 12:00
                    noon, the Senate adjourned to meet with the House of Representatives in joint session to compare the
                    votes cast the previous day and to inform officially the victorious candidate of his election. The

                    with four members absent due to illness. A committee of three members from each house informed
                    Beveridge of his election, and, escorted to the speaker's chair, the Senator-elect
                    delivered his speech of acceptance outlining the principles which would guide his future course.<hi rend="sup">114</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The significance of Beveridge's selection had its dual aspect, for Indiana and for the
                    nation. Friend and foe fully understood its meaning for Indiana Republican politics, and they laid
                    their plans accordingly. In command of the full force of federal patronage, Fairbanks could have
                    carried the day for Hanly had he acted more decisively. But overconfidence proved his undoing.
                    "It is quite true, as you say," learned a Hanly leader to his alarm,
                    "that Senator Fairbanks is not taking sides in this contest. This seems all the stranger
                    when you and myself know that Perry Heath, acting on the permission of President-elect McKinley,
                    went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and swung around enough legislators to insure Fairbanks'
                        election."<hi rend="sup">115</hi> He had neglected to act when action could have saved
                    the situation, and now he regretted his error.</p>
            <p>"I had a long talk with Senator F. the other night, having called to see him at his
                    request," reported Robert J. Tracewell to David W. Henry shortly after the election.
                    "I told him in a diplomatic way about what took place after Hanly was defeated [and] he now
                    seems to realize the situation." In the future, Tracewell felt certain, "his
                    friends will have nothing to complain of respecting his willingness to get charge of the party
                    organization in Indiana. In my judgment, he is at work now, and will never let up until things are
                    going right. He now knows who his friends are, and when and how he made a mistake."<hi rend="sup">116</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was Beveridge inactive. Aware of Fairbanks' hostility, he moved to consolidate his
                    newly-won position. A rival political machine was forming, fashioned by the skillful hand of the
                    young Senator-elect. "I wish to the Lord you could <list type="footnotes">

                    factional strife had begun in Indiana Republicanism.</p>
            <p>But Beveridge's selection had its significance beyond Indiana upon the national scene.
                    "The new Indiana Senator has never held office," remarked the <hi rend="i">American Monthly Review of Reviews,</hi> "and he comes into this high place in a
                    manner that must please the young men of the country In some such way as Governor
                    Roosevelt's election last November pleased them."<hi rend="sup">118</hi> Political
                    leadership had begun to shift from the men born in the 1830's and 1840's, and
                    Beveridge's elevation marked another instance of the rise of a younger generation into the
                    seats of power. That younger generation had found the depression of the 1890's a searing
                    experience which portended the end of a way of life most Americans cherished. The agrarian revolt,
                    the wave of bitter, bloody strikes had created a near-panic in middle class America, and
                    Beveridge's earlier mood of buoyant optimism never quite returned. The nation had grown up
                    in the happy assumption that the social conflicts troubling less fortunate lands could never happen
                    here, but by the close of the century Beveridge feared that this was no longer the case. Widening
                    class fissures cast their shadow across the American scene, and this larger issue concerned the
                    youthful Senator-elect as he addressed the General Assembly.<hi rend="sup">119</hi>

            <p>His real impulses deeply conservative, Beveridge sought by the resounding phrases of a fervent
                    nationalism to still that lurking menace of social upheaval haunting middle class America.
                    "Fate," he exclaimed, "has woven the life and welfare of every citizen of
                    our sacred Nation into the life and welfare of every other citizen beneath the flag." No
                    classes, no sections, Americans were brothers joined by the bonds of immortal memories, by the
                    kinship of glorious hopes, by the indissoluble decrees of historic destiny. "The people,
                    the whole people and nothing but the people," Beveridge cried, "is the
                    intellectual atmosphere in which a lawgiver should live and move and have his being." To
                    know no class but the nation became his ideal, to know no dream but its onward march his life work.</p>
            <p>"The unconquerable heart of the pioneer still beats within American breasts," he
                    rejoiced, "and the American flag advances still in its ceaseless and imperial progress,
                    with law and order and Christian civilization trooping beneath its sacred folds." If
                    America should renounce that ideal of future expansion beyond its present bounds, Beveridge warned,
                    its fate shall necessarily be the sad refrain of internal dissension, class hatred, sectional
                    division. But through faith in the imperial destiny of the American people, through fulfillment of
                    its civilizing duty to mankind lay in its hope of salvation. By looking outward America shall regain

            <p>Henry S. Lane was born in 1811 on a farm in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bath County</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After attending a country school and an academy he read law in the office of Colonel
                    James Suddeth and assisted in the county clerk's office. Three years later he was admitted
                    to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

            <p>In 1834 young Lane and his bride moved to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>, <region type="county">Montgomery County</region>
               </placeName>,
                    Indiana, where he formed a law partnership with Samuel C. Wilson which became well known in that
                    section of the state. In 1842 his first wife died and three years later Lane married Joanna Elston,
                    daughter of Isaac C. Elston, prominent <placeName>

                    </placeName> businessman.</p>
            <p>Politics soon lured Lane, eventually weaning him from the practice of law. He served in the Indiana
                    House of Representatives (1837–1838) and in the lower house of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Congress (1841–1845). An ardent Whig, he stumped the state for his political
                    idol, Henry Clay, during Clay's campaign for the presidency in 1844.</p>
            <p>Although most Northern Whigs denounced the Mexican War as a Democratic ruse to gain slave territory
                    from Mexico, Lane supported it. Instrumental in raising a company of volunteers from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery County</region>
                    </placeName>, he was elected captain when the company was organized at <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Lane was elected major of the regiment. While in service he was promoted to the rank

            <p>Lieutenant Colonel Lane received his discharge on June 16, 1847, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Enroute home with Mrs. Lane he made a stirring speech in defense of the war at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> which doubtless aided materially in securing recruits for the Indiana regiments. He
                    favored General Zachary Taylor for the presidency in 1848 despite the lukewarmness of many Hoosiers
                    because of Taylor's criticism of the Indiana volunteers following the battle of Buena
                    Vista.</p>
            <p>After the war the Lanes resided in Lane House, a pioneer mansion they had erected before the war, and
                    he resumed the practice of law. In 1853 he retired from the law because of ill health and thereafter
                    divided his time between politics and business, devoting considerable attention to banking in
                    association with his father-in-law.</p>
            <p>Politics soon beckoned him again and during the fifties he was perhaps the most popular advocate of
                    the new Republican party in Indiana. Although he had made an unsuccessful race for re-election to
                    Congress in 1849, by 1852 he was prominently mentioned as a Whig nominee for governor though he
                    would not allow his name to go before the state convention. In 1854 he served as chairman of the
                    initial state convention of the People's party and two years later he served in a similar
                    capacity for the first national convention of the Republican party. Late in 1858 the Indiana
                    legislature elected him to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate in an unsuccessful Republican maneuver to oust Indiana's two Democratic
                    senators whom the Republicans claimed had been illegally elected.</p>
            <p>In 1860 the Republicans, as the People's party had been known in Indiana since about 1860,
                    chose him to be their nominee for governor. As a conservative old-line Whig he suited the temper of
                    the party better than did Oliver P. Morton, the 1856 nominee. Morton, however, was selected as his
                    running mate, apparently with the understanding that if the ticket were successful Lane would become
                    Senator and Morton would succeed to the governorship. In the presidential campaign of 1860 Lane
                    vigorously opposed Seward and with equal vigor advocated Lincoln's nomination.</p>
            <p>Thus Lane became Indiana's first Republican governor, though he actually occupied the office
                    for only a few days during January, 1861. His inaugural address expressed intense <pb n="385" id="VAA4025-053-4-035"/> devotion to the Union. From 1861 to 1877 he served in the Senate, where
                    he was a partisan and faithful supporter of Lincoln, then later of the Radical Republicans against
                    President Johnson. When his term expired he did not seek re-election and he spent nearly all his
                    time after 1877 in business at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>

                                    &amp; unhealthy as words can describe. It made almost all of the regiment sick,
                                    more or less; it gave me the dysentery of which I nearly died. My whole recollection

                                    There is no order as yet, but all still fear such an order. I now think we shall not
                                    be ordered to go any farther into Mexico &amp; that [we] shall not see a single
                                    hostile Mexican, but that we shall have to encounter a much more terrible [enemy],

                                    to chronicle except a constant firing of cannon on the river about which caused some
                                    excitement in the camp. Sickness seems to day on the increase &amp; the desire
                                    among the soldiers for discharges is also on the increase. The life of a soldier is
                                    a hard one &amp; it ought to be one of glory. No coffee &amp; no sugar in

                                    The prospect for a fight rather more gloomy. We are now assured that we shall remain

                                    </placeName>, but the change is in us &amp; not in the institution, for all the
                                    divine institutions partake of the character of of their author for immutability.
                                    Instead of the sound of the church bells &amp; the hum of prayer &amp;
                                    thronging thousands of Christian votaries, we have here the sounds of mirth, of
                                    rioting, of blasphemy, &amp; all manner of irreverence &amp; ungodliness. It
                                    is strange that men become more &amp; more hardened &amp; obdurate as the
                                    chances for sudden death are increased. A camp life is demoralizing in all its
                                    tendencies. Men who at home are moral, kind, &amp; humane, here in too many
                                    instances become immoral, unkind, &amp; morose men. Who at home can weep over
                                    every tale of imaginary here have no tears for the death of a friend or messmate.
                                    The reason for which change may be found in the fact that so much of personal
                                    comfort of the soldier must necessarily depend on himself that he is taught to rely
                                    on himself alone &amp; becomes unsocial &amp; selfish. When we left home a
                                    case of serious sickness or a case of death made a vivid &amp; most painful
                                    impression, but now men sicken, die, &amp; are buried, &amp; forgotten
                                    almost, in the same day; &amp; still war seems the natural trade of men, the

                        <p>August 10th, 1846. Wrote a letter today to my dear Joan in answer to one received
                                    from her last night. It is sweet to receive a letter from one we love at any time,
                                    but here there is a pleasure in it which is indiscribable. I read &amp; read
                                    &amp; reread &amp; each successive reading is almost equal to a new letter.
                                    A letter from home—oh how it calls up all of the sweet memories of the
                                    happy days spent in sweet communion with kindred spirits in the home of the
                                    heart's best &amp; holiest affections. Last [night] I heard a sermon,
                                    the first since I left Indiana. It was preached by Lt. Poe<hi rend="sup">11</hi>—a plain feeling &amp; practical discourse. He is a Methodist
                                    preacher. His sermon had a fine effect. The service was most imposeing. It was in
                                    the open air with the officer[s] and soldiers grouped around the minister, with the
                                    clear blue sky over us &amp; the bright stars nightly sentinels of the upper
                                    encampment looking down upon us &amp; a full moon silvering over with its mild
                                    effulgence hill top &amp; valley &amp; river. At the close of the sermon the
                                    preacher referred to our distant homes &amp; the kind friends who at that same
                                    hour were praying for us &amp; the perils of our present service &amp; the
                                    uncertainty of life, &amp; the eye of many a rough soldier glistened with tears.
                                    I am daily becoming more &amp; more partial to the Methodist Church &amp;
                                    its form of worship. Oh how I do wish that I was good enough to join that church
                                    where my dear wife worships, &amp; to adorn that faith which she illustrates in
                                    her practice.</p>
                        <p>August 11th, 1846. The warmest day we have yet had. No breeze until after dinner this
                                    evening. At 2 o'clock summoned upon a brigade court martial—my
                                    first appearance as a member of a criminal court. Today we have heard that our
                                    regiment are to go to the mouth of the Rio Grande &amp; that no Indiana troops
                                    are to be marched upon the enemy until the last of Sept. Bad policy to bring troops
                                    here in the heat of the summer without any provisions or transportation for them.
                                    Many, very many of our troops will die here from fevers long before they can be of

                                    is alone responsible, that is, responsible in theory; in practice there is no

                        <p>August 12th, 1846. All day today engaged upon a court martial as judge advocate. It
                                    was a new business &amp; came awkward at first, but I now have the hang of the
                                    matter. It is a laborous business, but $3 per day as judge advocate in
                                    addition to regular pay is something. I have written today seven hours. Being judge
                                    advocate is a much slower way to make money than practicing law. Sent a letter this

                        <p>August 13th, 1846. Warm, sultry day. All in. Day spent in court martial. Great
                                    sickness in camp.</p>
                        <p>August 14th. The weather more pleasant. On a court martial again. Health of self
                                    good. An order come for our removal to the mouth of the Rio Grande. Prospect for a
                                    battle rather more gloomy.</p>
                        <p>August 15th. Began remooveing to the river over a pond, 1/2 mile wide &amp; waist
                                    deep, the men carrying baggage on their shoulders.</p>
                        <p>Sunday the 16th, 1846. Remooved from Camp Belknap to the bank of the
                                    river—a serious job. The troops had to pack all the bagg[ag]e for two
                                    miles, the most of the way in water waist-deep; it was done without a murmer. I
                                    helped to make the moove &amp; then read 6 chapters in the Testament &amp;
                                    thought much of home &amp; the dear wife. The troops caught four catfish
                                    weighing from 20 to 30 lbs.—a great treat. Wished for the major<hi rend="sup">12</hi> to be here to enjoy the sport.</p>
                        <p>August 17th, 1846. A fine bright morning. Helped to get breakfast. I then done my
                                    part towards eating it. Fine health &amp; spirits. Sent to the Point for letters
                                    &amp; live today in the hope of hearing from my dear Joan. Dear indeed to me is
                                    she, far dearer than I had ever conceived when at home. What is she doing this
                                    bright morning? Perhaps she is at this moment sending up prayers for my welfare,
                                    spiritual &amp; temporal, &amp; I feel while I write that her prayers are

                        <p>August 21st. A little sick from eating too much fresh beef. In daily expectation of

                                    country is decidedly more pleasant than Indiana or indeed any place I have ever been
                                    in. It is one of the richest countries in the world. The necessaries &amp;
                                    comforts of life are produced spontaneously. All the tropical fruits could be

                                    old times &amp; the Methodist Church. Fine clear day &amp; fine sea breeze.
                                    Disappointed in not getting a letter from my dear Joan, but hope to get one on
                                    tomorrow &amp; that hope holds me up for another day. Laying plans for a trip to

                        <p>August 23d, 1846. Another Sunday has passed. I hope I have not been wholly unmindful
                                    of its obligations &amp; privileges, but again I have to lament the impiety
                                    &amp; blasphemy which reigns in our camp &amp; I suppose in all camps. Wars
                                    are the very engines by which the prince of evil peoples Hell.</p>

                                    it created more sensation than I should have supposed from the indifference that
                                    seemed to prevail in camp on the subject, but it only shows that politicks, like
                                    sin, is a natural element in human character, or perhaps both are but modifications
                                    of the same thing. At all events, you can not distroy either with[out] distruction
                                    to that strange [thing?] called man. Mr. Harney is prepareing to leave. He carries
                                    with him our warmest wishes for his success &amp; prosperity in life. He is an
                                    honest man &amp; an unpretending gentleman of fine talents. He has been sorely
                                    tried but bears it like a man.</p>
                        <p>August 25th, 1846. An exceedingly warm day with no breeze &amp; a head ache
                                    &amp; little tendency to fever. Heard of a revolution against Paredes<hi rend="sup">20</hi> in Mexico &amp; the defection of the garrison &amp;

                        <p>August 27th. A very hard rain &amp; I have serious apprehension of an overflow of
                                    the river &amp; consequent fever from miasma. A low grade of congestive fever
                                    has appeared in camp &amp; the doctors think it dangerous if not taken in time.
                                    They [think] it will not do to give calomel, that the patient commences to sink on
                                    the first attack, &amp; instead of depletion they give stimulants from the
                                    start. My experience here confirms this theory.</p>
                        <p>August 28. A very oppressive &amp; warm morning. My health is good. I am at
                                    length clear of dysentery, at least I hope so. I am a good [deal] enfeebled with
                                    tendency to cholic &amp; headache &amp; a morbid appetite that cleans out
                                    rations of any kind good or bad, sound or rotten. Last night wrote Col. Willson
                                    [&amp;] to my brother.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> A little anxiety getting up in camp
                                    about the election. Not much with me.</p>
                        <p>August 29th, 1846. Started to the mouth of the river with Genl. Lane<hi rend="sup">22</hi> to see Commodore Webster about the plan for an attack on Tampico in which
                                    he wishes our brigade to cooperate, if Genl. Taylor will consent (which he never
                                    will do). Had to turn back. Could not get the horses over the canal. Genl. Lane went
                                    down afoot. He is a man of great energy, which is the secret of his success. I like
                                    him. He is very kind to me, grants all my request[s], &amp; treats [me] with
                                    great respect &amp; seems to court my friendship. I prophecy to day that the war
                                    is over &amp; that within 60 day[s] from today we shall be disbanded. For the
                                    next month we shall have a great amount of sickness. A number of new cases of fever
                                    in camp today. The prospect of peace seems to depress the spirits of the troops
                                    &amp; renders them indifferent about discipline &amp; drill. They still talk
                                    large about fighting, but the news of peace would be welcome to the most of us. An
                                    honerable peace would be hailed with joy by me, for one, for anything is preferable
                                    to our present state of inaction &amp; suspense. I am satisfied that we shall
                                    never see a hostile Mexican. Then why in the name of justice, policy, &amp;
                                    common sense are we kept here to die of fevers &amp; to swell the expenses of
                                    the government? It is to make a hero of Taylor, to save Folk's

                                    breakfast hour. Some apprehensions of a rise in the river &amp; the overflow of

                                    they are writing to my wife &amp; looking at her picture. I find my thoughts
                                    recurring often towards home. It is barely possible that I am getting home sick;
                                    indeed for the last few days I have rather suspected that such is the case.</p>
                        <p>Monday morning, August 31st. A warm, very warm day &amp; a return of dysentery.
                                    The news from above looks like peace, but we shall probably be detained here until
                                    winter or spring. If I was sure that the fighting was over I should be anxious to go
                                    home, for anything rather than a life of inactivity &amp; suspense. The glitter

                        <p>Sept. 1st, 1846. First day in our new camp. Got an order for lumber to make me a cot
                                    or bed from Capt. Ogden,<hi rend="sup">23</hi> &amp; also for lumber for a cot

                                    &amp; oysters. A. Morrison<hi rend="sup">24</hi> arrived this morning. He will

                                    was better for me than all medicines &amp; doctors in camp. Our present position
                                    is a pleasant one in some respects but in others Good Lord deliver us. The loose
                                    drifting sand is in our eyes, mouth, noise [nose] on our beds, in our victuals
                                    &amp; drinking water. We are most truly &amp; emphatically on a sandy
                                    foundation but I hope our position is favorable to health. I am gaining strength
                                    every day. This night will be the first on my new cot. Quite an improovement <list type="footnotes">

                                    getting far more general owing to the fact that there is no present prospect of any

                        <p>Sept. 4th, 1846. Great trouble in the medical department. This department has been
                                    the subject of great complaint &amp; not without abundant cause. It could not

                                    grave yard? Wrote again to day to my dear wife Joan. This is one of my comforts, to

                        <p>Sept. 5th, 1846. Bright &amp; beautiful morning &amp; fine pleasant breeze
                                    from the gulf, but every breeze seems freighted with death &amp; disease. Fevers
                                    encrease both in the number of cases &amp; violence of the attacks. Lts. Hanks

                                    reasons, but two is sufficient. In the first place, the volunteer force was not
                                    needed, &amp; secondly if needed they were not needed &amp; could not be

                        <p>Sept. 8th. Lt. Goss very sick with a low grade of congestive fever, the same form of
                                    fever which has carried off so many of our troops. Thomas also quite sick with same
                                    fever. We hope to save them. My own health not so good. Some tendency to fever
                                    &amp; fullness in the head.</p>
                        <p>Sept. 9th. On last evening got a letter from my dear wife in answer to mine of the
                                    24th of July, 1846, in which I gave her an account of our shipwreck. I was much
                                    affected by the simple pathos, deep feeling, &amp; unaffected piety which
                                    pervaded her letter. If ever I feel the power of religion it will be under Heaven
                                    owing to her gentle &amp; sweet influence exercized upon my harsh &amp;
                                    stubborn nature. I feel that I am better while I read her words of wisdom &amp;
                                    truth. Nothing new in camp. Sickness about as usual. I am preparing to go to
                                    Metamores to get pay. Shall remain probably a week for my health, &amp; to see
                                    the country, &amp;c.</p>

                                    week Lt. Goss died on the 14th. On the 13th John Bratten<hi rend="sup">29</hi> died.
                                    On the 15th William Hopper<hi rend="sup">30</hi> died. They were all good men
                                    &amp; their death caused gloom in the company. They all died of fever. Our
                                    physicians have not been able to manage this disease. We shall bury a great many of
                                    our best men before we leave this miserable camp. Drew at Matamores the pay

                        <p>Sept. 19, 1846. We are looseing out of the regiment from congestive fever about two
                                    each day &amp; no medicines in the hospital &amp; so far as our surgeon
                                    &amp; assistant surgeon is concerned we would be far better without either. They
                                    do not &amp; cannot arrest the disease. Oh for a thousand tongues to curse the

                        <p>Sept. 20. Sunday &amp; rather more quiet than usual. The sickness has one good
                                    effect—it seems to sober the minds of men &amp; officers. Our
                                    position is alarming on account [of] the malignant fever now prevailing, &amp;
                                    if men can be brought to think upon their latter end our situation must induce
                                    serious reflection upon the frail tenure of our life in camp. Today Goddard, Morgan,

                        <p>Sept. 21st, 1846. The equinoctial storm has commenced in good earnest &amp; many
                                    of the tents were blown [down]. The wind was accompanied with torrents of rain which
                                    seems to have cooled the air. I hope this change in the air will be favorable to
                                    health, at least so far that there will not be so many new cases of fever, but I
                                    fear all the old cases will terminate fatally &amp; that in a short time. I have
                                    been for 3 days afflicted with a pain in my head from the influence of the heat
                                    &amp; light of the sun. I fear such is the fact but may be deceived.</p>
                        <p>Sept. 22d, 1846. The spirits of the troops is fast failing &amp; they are giveing
                                    way to gloom &amp; desponding &amp; God knows they have enough cause. Last
                                    night I was thinking of home &amp; the dear one there &amp; just as I had
                                    fixed the whole scene in my imagination the sad, solemn, &amp; wild wail of the
                                    funeral march struck upon my ear. I had heard it often before, alas, too often, but
                                    never before with such feelings. I thought of the gallant young men whom I had
                                    induced to leave their home &amp; all its comforts for the pestilential vapours
                                    &amp; poisonous breath of a southern clime until every note of the funeral sunk
                                    like a leaden weight upon my heart &amp; allmost stilled its pulsations. I could
                                    not help thinking that I in some sort was responsible for their death, &amp; the
                                    thought planted daggers in my soul &amp; I became a very child. Tears came to my
                                    relief. I tried to call up reason, fortitude, phylosophy to my aid but all in vain.
                                    At last I thought of religion &amp; the blessed light of revelation shone full
                                    upon God's providence making <list type="footnotes">

                                    the clouds are dark &amp; the storm rages never so fiercely. For we have an
                                    interest in the mighty master of the storm, an interest as sure &amp; steadfast
                                    as the foundations of His throne. The habit of playing the dead march at funerals in
                                    camp is, I think, decidedly unfavorable upon the sick. It needs all their strenghth
                                    &amp; manhood to sustain them under their trials here, &amp; the influence
                                    of the music is deeply depressing upon their spirits, &amp; they are reminded of
                                    the great probability that the next time their comrades shall march to the sad notes
                                    of that most gloomy air their steps will lead to their graves. Another custom we
                                    have in camp here it is to bury at night. The effect of this is also injurious. The
                                    funeral of a fellow mortal is gloomy enough when surrounded by friends &amp; in
                                    the full glare of broad day light, but it is rendered doubly solemn, impressive,
                                    &amp; affecting when it is performed at night with no one to sympathize but
                                    strangers, nothing to interrupt the felt silence but the wailing of the dead march,
                                    &amp; the far off &amp; bright stars, those constant &amp; everlasting
                                    witnesses of human woe &amp; misery, looking down as if ready to melt with pity
                                    for man's passion, madness, &amp; crime. When will man learn that he is
                                    the brother &amp; friend of man &amp; [not] his natural &amp; sworn
                                    enemy? Never, until the mild spirit of the gospel which is the spirit of peace shall
                                    pervade our sin-crushed world.</p>
                        <p>Sept. 23d. We still look with anxiety to hear from Genl. Taylor's advance
                                    upon Monterey. If he takes the place without a fight I shall conclude that there is
                                    no fight in the Mexicans, &amp; if they make fight &amp; are defeated, with
                                    as large a force as they are represented to have, they cannot embody another force
                                    sufficient to arrest Taylor's march, &amp; the prospect of peace will
                                    be increased. Before this time Buckhannan's letter of the 27th of July has

                                    operations from the Rio Grande owing to the difficulty of transportation, the
                                    character of the country, &amp; the distance from the Rio Grande to the city.
                                    The plan of the campaign has been wrong if Mexico was the object, but well enough if
                                    peace is made at the end of the present campaign. The volunteers should have been
                                    kept at home &amp; drilled until the last of Sept. &amp; then taken direct

                                    does not amount to extortion there is no use or meaning in words. But enough of

                        <p>Sept. 26th, 1846. A continued &amp; violent wind &amp; great apprehension of

                        <p>Sept. 27th, 1846. Sunday &amp; rather more quiet than common owing to the fact
                                    that a great number of the troops are sick. The violent northers have prevailed for
                                    three days &amp; blown the water of the gulf out into the river above our camp
                                    &amp; rendered the water brackish &amp; salt. It has brought bowel complaint
                                    on the men again &amp; is as unpleasant as water can be. The men &amp;
                                    officers are all, with the exception of Col. Drake,<hi rend="sup">36</hi> very
                                    anxious to moove our camp up the river. This should be done by all means. We are
                                    nearly all sick here &amp; without wood or water fit to drink, &amp; the
                                    drifting sand gets into everything we drink or eat, &amp; the effects of it is
                                    most seriously &amp; injuriously felt on the eyes. A worse encampment for the
                                    fall or winter cauld not have been selected. The whole volunteers corps have been
                                    treated like dogs in this campaign &amp; the Indiana brigade has been worse used
                                    than any other, probably because they have been more uncomplaining. The Drs. say
                                    that men cannot live as we are situated. We are in a fair way to try the experiment
                                    as there seems no present prospect of things getting better. We shall, I hope, have
                                    more sense the next time than to put ourselves in such a position.</p>
                        <p>Monday 28th. The same as yesterday only all the evils of this cursed camp is getting
                                    more &amp; more intolerable. It is enough to make the most patient complain
                                    &amp; the most pious swear. Why are we here? Why has our brigade been left
                                    behind all the rest? Some one must answer these questions.</p>
                        <p>Sept. 29th. Heard of Taylor's victory or rather of Ampudia's<hi rend="sup">37</hi> capitulation, for it was hardly a victory as I understand the
                                    report of the battle. Taylor gained possession of Monterey, to be sure, but on such
                                    terms as shows plainly that the enemy were not in his possession. It is rather a
                                    drawn battle, but the truce agreed on will, I think, end in a peace.</p>
                        <p>Sept. 30th. Wrote to day to my father-in-law, Major Elston, an account of
                                    Taylor's victory, for I can find no other name for it, although it was not
                                    much of a victory after all. <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>Oct. 1st, 1846 is here, &amp; oh how I have looked for the first of October in
                                    the hope that sickness would abate, &amp; the result seems to proove that the
                                    worst of our sickness is over. There has been no new case of fever for 7 or 8 days.
                                    Our fevers now be intermittent &amp; not of so dangerous a type.</p>
                        <p>Oct 2d, 1846. We have now cold nights &amp; heavy dews &amp; very warm days.
                                    There is great desire among the troops to return home, believing that there is to be
                                    no fighting. I am looking for a letter from my dear wife. I am anxious to learn

                                    </placeName> so as to make my arrangements for meeting her there.</p>
                        <p>Oct. 3d, 1846. No letter from my dear wife for three weeks. Oh how I do long to hear
                                    from her. Married men ought not to go to war. It is not required of them by any
                                    consideration of duty [or] of public policy, &amp; for one I am satisfied that I
                                    am on my last campaign.</p>
                        <p>Oct. 4th. Another Sunday but no day of rest. The camp is all in a stew about four
                                    companies getting off to guard a train of wagons to Monterey. Rumors are rife of our
                                    removal up the country. All are anxious to go. We have been most rascally treated in
                                    not being allowed to go up in the time for battle a[t] Monterey. Gross favoritism
                                    has prevailed over justice &amp; propriety. Our brigade left home before the <placeName>

                                    bank. We also crossed the gulf first &amp; our brigade is composed of as good
                                    material as theirs. Political considerations &amp; influences have decided our
                                    fate &amp; in time the world shall know how our state has been degraded in the
                                    persons of her volunteer officers &amp; troops. But enough of this sickening

                        <p>Oct. 5th, 1846. Received a letter from my dear Joan. She wrote rather gloomily
                                    &amp; I reproached myself most bitterly for ever haveing left her. Oh how she
                                    suffers from all the combined horrors of suspense, fear &amp; hope defered. But
                                    if it is the will of the Lord to let me return I will devote the remnant of my days
                                    to his service &amp; to promote the comfort &amp; happiness of my dear

                                    abandoned the idea of comeing south. This was to her a great sacrifice &amp;
                                    grievous disappointment. She is the best woman extant. This she done to obey me
                                    &amp; for fear that I might be lost in the gulf in comeing over to see her. Oh

                                    </placeName> &amp; one to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, explaining to her the reason why I could not come to see her.</p>
                        <p>Oct. 23d. Rode up to Palo Alto where I joined Capts. May &amp; Roberts &amp;
                                    their companies whither they had gone for the health of the troops. The place is a
                                    very pleasant encampment &amp; is certainly healthy if there is any healthy
                                    situation on this cursed river.</p>
                        <p>Oct 24th. The boys are killing plenty of game &amp; catching fine fish. Yesterday
                                    Capt. May's company brought in 3 rabbits &amp; seven geese &amp;
                                    two very fine fish. We have now plenty of sweet milk, corn bread, &amp; roasting
                                    ears &amp; fresh eggs &amp; our liveing is decidedly good compared with any
                                    thing we have had before on the river. I had forgotten to except as to musketoes
                                    &amp; seed ticks. They are here in great force.</p>
                        <p>Oct. 25th, 1846. Sunday. The boys spent in fishing, hunting, &amp; feasting. I
                                    spent it helping Major Cravens<hi rend="sup">38</hi> hunt his horse &amp; in
                                    visiting the Mexican ranches to get something good to eat. Got green corn, eggs,
                                    corn bread, &amp; sweet milk, &amp; Eph Woodruff<hi rend="sup">39</hi> gave
                                    us a part of a fine catfish.</p>
                        <p>Oct. 26th. A rainey morning morning with the appearance of the commencement of long
                                    rainey spell, which God forbid, as we have poor protection from it in our old thin
                                    worn out tents. But we must take it as it comes, &amp; therewith try to be
                                    content.</p>
                        <p>27th of Oct. Went to Matamores to wait on Capt. Roberts &amp; remained there
                                    until the 5th of Dec. during which time I had a very severe spell of congestive
                                    fever succeeded by chills. Gambling, drinking, &amp; all the kindred vices
                                    seemed to be on the increase in Metamores. This place seems to be as ripe for
                                    God's vengeance as Sodom &amp; Gomorrow were when the Brimstone began
                                    to fall.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 5th. Returned home, that is to camp at the mouth of the Rio Grande. Brought down
                                    the news of the order from Genl. Patterson<hi rend="sup">40</hi> for us to moove

                                    regiment about 10 o'clock at night a short speech which the boys responded
                                    to most cordially.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 6th. Sunday. Wrote a letter to my Joan &amp; fixed up some shells to send to
                                    her by Mr. Bohon. Spent this day in reading &amp; in think[ing] of home
                                    &amp; all of my dear friends there &amp; in building air castles to be
                                    inhabited in future.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 7th, 1846. Nothing of interest except a spell of sick headache which lasted
                                    until late at night. The boys of the mess very kind but no one can wait on me as
                                    well as <hi rend="i">My Joan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Dec. 8th, 1846. A very sudden change in the weather from very warm to quite cold
                                    accompanied by a severe northern wind as such changes always are in this country.
                                    The boys are all exceedingly anxious for a moove &amp; so am I for any change
                                    from this miserable grave yard must be for the better.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 9th, 1846. Last night a small portion of the Cass Company went over the river
                                    &amp; burnt up a grocery &amp; a shed attached. This was done to revenge a
                                    beating which had been inflicted upon two of that company by the Mexicans. Yesterday
                                    being pay day about one third of the boys were drunk. The regiment had been suffered
                                    to do as they please for so long a time that anything like restraint sets hard upon
                                    the troops. The example of the officers upon the privates is anything but wholesome.
                                    When officers get drunk &amp; forget the office they hold it is not strange it
                                    is not strange that men imitate them.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 10th, 1846. Left the mouth of the Rio Grande for Monterey. The troops, officers
                                    &amp; men, in fine spirits. The prospect of a fight seemed to put new life into
                                    them. The[y] marched towards the battlefield as to a place of amusement, but in a
                                    few short months or weeks many hearts that now beat high with hope will be still in
                                    death. Reached Mata-mores in the morning of the 11th.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 11th. Left Metamores for Carmargo. There seems no bounds to the buoyancy of the
                                    troops. There is after all is said about the privations of a soldier's life
                                    something deeply exciting in camp life. The pageantry &amp; eclat of arms will
                                    interest man as long as his nature remains unchanged. Warfare seems to be our
                                    natural trade, &amp; the history of the world is but a recital of heroes
                                    &amp; their butcheries.</p>
                        <pb n="407" id="VAA4025-053-4-057"/>
                        <p>Dec. 12th. Still on our winding way to Carmargo, &amp; it is most emphatically a
                                    winding way for no river in the world is more tortuous than the Rio Grande. Passed
                                    Reynosa, a small village situated on the river on fine rising ground. Here we
                                    encounter the first rock formation as we pass up from the gulf. The rock is a kind
                                    of soft like stone. The population of this village is about 1500 or 2000. It is of
                                    no great importance in a military point of view but on the passage up the river by
                                    Genl. Taylor it was in the beginning of the war a convenient depot for munitions of
                                    war &amp; provisions. It is now garrisoned by two companies of regulars.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 13th, 1846. This day is Sunday. Read in the Bible &amp; thought much of home
                                    &amp; the loved one there &amp; lived over again the happy days now passed
                                    &amp; gone. Very pleasant traveling companions but most wretched fare on the
                                    boat, &amp; I must chronicle the name of our steamboat, the "J. E.
                                    Roberts"— a fine running boat but with the Capt. money seems the
                                    only object, as indeed it is with all contractors, sutlers, camp followers,
                                    &amp; government agents. The government seems to be considered fair prey by the
                                    gentry above specified.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 14th, 1846. Reached Camargo, a town situated on the San Juan four miles above
                                    its junction with the Rio Grande. This town has, as all Mexican towns has, a plaza
                                    &amp; Catholic church. It is a very poor place &amp; accounted very sickly.
                                    It is much dreaded on account of dust in dry weather &amp; rain in wet. It is
                                    altogether the least desirable place to reside that I have seen in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 15th. Spent this day in getting mules &amp; breaking them for our march to
                                    Monterey &amp; saw Genl. Marshall<hi rend="sup">41</hi> &amp; purchased his
                                    fine duelling pistols for $35. Found the Genl. very clean &amp; kind.
                                    All is anxiety to be on the moove.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 16th, 1846. Wrote to my dear wife in the morning &amp; then was very busily
                                    employed in assisting to get the regiment ready to march. Shot with Genl. Lane with
                                    pistols &amp; beat him. It was, however, an accident as he is a fine shot
                                    &amp; I shoot but indifferently well.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 17th, 1846. Still at this general depot of all the dust in Northern Mexico but
                                    with fair prospects of leaving on tomorrow or the next day. While writing I am

                        <p>Dec. 19th, 1846. Left Camargo with the regiment for Monterey &amp; after going on
                                    six or eight miles met an order from Genl. Butler<hi rend="sup">42</hi> made in
                                    ignorance of Genl. Patterson's order &amp; ordering us back, 8
                                    companies to Matamoros &amp; two companies to the mouth. Genl. Lane &amp;
                                    Col. Drake very promptly &amp; very properly refused obedience to the order
                                    &amp; also an order of Genl. Marshall made out. It would seem on his own hook
                                    our Col. ordered the regiment to which they most readily obeyed.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 20th, 1846. Left the regiment in company with Genl. Lane &amp; escort for
                                    Monterey. Took dinner at Mier, a small but beautiful village celebrated for a
                                    sanguinary battle fought there between the Texans &amp; Mexicans &amp; also
                                    for the beauty &amp; modest deportment of its women. They are very fair for
                                    Mexico, but oh how different from <hi rend="i">our women.</hi> From Mier we
                                    proceeded to Pont Aquada,<hi rend="sup">43</hi> a small village where we staid all
                                    night. The country from Mier is generally barren.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 21. Left Pont Auquada &amp; travelled over a most barren &amp; desolate
                                    country forty five miles &amp; staid all night at the deserted ranche with the
                                    Third Regiment. During this day's travel we had the first sight of the
                                    mountains &amp; a most georgeous &amp; magnificent sight it was. Sunrise
                                    upon Sierra Madre range— it surpassed in gradeur &amp; loveliness any
                                    view I have seen among the Alleganies of my own loved land.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 22d. Saw Genl. Taylor at his camp. He was very polite &amp; affable,
                                    complimented Indiana &amp; her volunteers, &amp; I prophecy that he was
                                    thinking of the Presidency. He is plain in his dress &amp; appearance &amp;
                                    his countenance does not indicate great talent. But great talent for military
                                    affairs he certainly has. But still he does not fill my idea of a hero.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 23d, 24th, &amp; 25th. Remained at Monterey. This in a military point of
                                    view [is a] very strong place &amp; it was a most brilliant affair to take it.
                                    But the takeing of that place has not advanced us towards a peace one inch. It is an
                                    injury to us. Monterey is a very beautiful city haveing a population of 15 or 20
                                    thousand inhabitants. It is situated in <list type="footnotes">

                                    surrounded by a small, well cultivated valley &amp; it one time was a place of
                                    great wealth. It is now on the decline, but its former oppulence may be seen in its
                                    splendid cathedral &amp; extensive public improovements. The remains of the
                                    Bishop's Pallace is well worthy the attention of the traveller. It must
                                    have cost in its erection $50,000. In this country all the wealth seems
                                    to flow into the coffers of the church as naturally as water flows down hill.</p>

                                    night at the celebrated pass half way from Monterey to Saltillo. This is now
                                    deserted but there has been a rich farm here &amp; a fine hacienda.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 28th. Reached Saltillo, a city built of unburnt brick plastered. It [is] very
                                    finely watered &amp; is surrounded by a fertile valley of small extent. It is
                                    larger than Monterey &amp; shows more evidence of style &amp; wealth. It is
                                    over two thousand feet higher than Monterey &amp; is said to be healthy. Saw
                                    fine wheat growing here. The people in this mountain region are superior in body

                                    He was very polite &amp; attentive to us.</p>
                        <p>Dec. 29 &amp; 30th. Remained at Saltillo &amp; saw Genl. Worth.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> More pleased with his appearance and conversation than I have been with

                        <p>Dec. 31st. Left for Monterey on my return &amp; travelled the same route that I
                                    had passed which is the most barren &amp; undesirable of any country of the same

                        <p>Jan. 2d, 1847. Left Monterey for Matamoros where I arrived after a tedious journey on
                                    the 12th of Jan., haveing experienced cold weather, snow &amp;
                                    ice—two things very rare in this genial or rather burning climate. The
                                    regiment in good health &amp; fine spirits &amp; all seemed glad to see me.</p>
                        <p>Jan. 13th. In camp. Attended drill &amp; got letters &amp; presents from the
                                    dear one at home. God bless her.</p>
                        <p>January 14th, 1847. Today reviewed the regiment by order of Col. Drake. The boys
                                    acquitted themselves, both officers &amp; men, with great credit in my poor
                                    judgement.</p>
                        <p>Jan. 15th, 1847. Attended drill &amp; had a spell of sick headache.</p>
                        <p>Jan. 16th, 1847. Received a letter from my dear Joan dated Dec. 15th, and answered
                                    it. It was just such a letter as I like to get. It made me it filled the eyes
                                    &amp; warmed the heart; it spoke of anxiety &amp; love &amp; devotion

                                    that in the midst of arms religion &amp; morals are silent.</p>
                        <p>Jan. 18th, 1847. Wrote to Col. Willson, my old well tried &amp; devoted friend,

                        <p>19th Jan., 1847. The usual parades. A cold norther blowing &amp; the camp very
                                    uncomfortable. I have, however, good quarters in town at Mr. Gilmore's.

                                    Reading, writing &amp;c. Beautiful morning like spring. I left in camp rumors of
                                    the moovement of troops. Nothing known yet.</p>
                        <p>January 25th, 1847. Commenced boarding at Mr. Gilmore's today at
                                    $16 per month. Very heavy fog, damp &amp; disagreeable. The
                                    appearance of opening spring. Oppressive heat in the middle of the day.</p>
                        <p>January 26th, 1847. Visited the battlegrounds of Palo Alto &amp; Resaca de la
                                    Palma. These battles under all the circumstances reflects the highest honor upon our
                                    regular army, both officers &amp; men. I could not but feel some pride in the
                                    recollection of the 8th &amp; 9th, but this pride as an American was dashed with
                                    some bitter reflections which I felt as a man. At Palo Alto the Mexican lines can
                                    yet be plainly traced across the open prairie by the unburied &amp; whitening
                                    bones of her slain soldiery &amp; their scattered uniforms &amp; equipments.
                                    While gazeing upon the skeletons my imagination was busy in filling up the history
                                    of each mouldering remnant of manhood. I asked myself which or whether all of the
                                    dear social &amp; household ties were severed when they fell; whether they left
                                    he left a fond mother to watch &amp; pray for their return to that home they
                                    were distined never to see; whether he left a devoted [wife] to weep &amp;
                                    wither in his absence; whether she believes the story of his death or yet watches
                                    for the dear form &amp; listens for the well known footsteps which never more
                                    shall gladden her ear; whether the wild wail of the orphan mingles with the cry of
                                    the wife &amp; the mother; or <list type="footnotes">

                                    idol of his heart yet hopes for &amp; believes he will yet return. Alas he is no
                                    bridegroom of hers. He is the bride groom of death, stern relentless. I thought also
                                    of the sorrow-stricken &amp; bending form of the aged father &amp; then I
                                    thought of the clenched hand &amp; knit brow &amp; bursting heart of the
                                    bereaved brother. Before I had half filled this heartsickening picture I turned with
                                    horrow &amp; disgust from the humiliating scene. Oh there is a most fearful
                                    responsibility rests upon the heads of rulers who madly involve nations in war. One
                                    little incident upon the battleground touched me more than anything else. I found
                                    around the neck bone of a Mexican soldier a brass image of the Saviour with his
                                    string of beads upon which he told his prayers. I gazed upon this simple memento of
                                    his faith until I could allmost see the mortal agony which convulsed his manly frame
                                    in the death struggle &amp; hear the thick breathing foretelling speedy
                                    dissolution, &amp; then I saw the eye as it grew dim to all other impressions,
                                    grow bright as it gazed upon the image of the blessed Nazarine. I thought of the
                                    hasty, yet soul-felt prayer which he breathed in that dread hour to the blessed
                                    Saviour. Did he pray for himself? Oh no, his faith was confirmed by one look at his
                                    crucified Lord. He prayed for the dear loved &amp; lost ones whom he left
                                    behind. I left these scenes of bloodshed &amp; violence asking of myself if this
                                    was indeed glory, the glory of rational immortal man, if it is always to be
                                    accounted honerable to butcher our brethren. It cannot be. The dawn of a bright day
                                    is upon us when nations shall learn war no more forever. A visit to a recent
                                    battlefield speaks more eloquently of the horrors of war than all the books ever
                                    written or sermons ever spoken.</p>

                                    to camp disappointed in not getting a letter from my Joan but know it is no fault of

                                    service before our time expires. It is better to deserve than to command good
                                    fortune. There is comfort in that maxim at all events.</p>

                                    far surpassing the best form of heathenism. In this land of the stranger it is sweet

                                    the horrors of war. Ten deaths in my old company to this date. Am I not in some sort
                                    accountable for the lives of these young men? I did not intend them harm when I
                                    urged them to enlist; I thought of patriotism, honor, &amp; glory, but to them
                                    what are all these things? They lost their homes, their relatives, their country;
                                    they died in the stranger's land. I hope they were prepared for the solemn
                                    &amp; awful change. Few tears water their graves, &amp; no stone points out
                                    the place of their rest, but in my heart their memory is fixed &amp;
                                    time's effaceing fingers can never blot it out until life itself shall
                                    become extinct. Visited today the Senior Alcalde Mr. Manchacka, a gentleman, a
                                    scholar, &amp; man of high talents &amp; fine accomplishments. Had music on

                                    for supper. Left much pleased with the evening's entertainment.</p>
                        <p>Feb. 7th, 1847. Sunday. Helped to enforce the closeing of all the stores, Mexican
                                    &amp; American, in the city. To day the city did indeed present a Sabbath
                                    stillness. Read 15 chapters in the Bible. Thought of home &amp; the dear good
                                    angel presiding there. Some how or other my dear becomes dear[er] as I feel more
                                    &amp; more inclined to try to be good enough for her sweet society here
                                    &amp; here after.</p>
                        <p>Feb. 8th, 1847. The usual routine of drill, plans for fortifying the city. Become
                                    acquainted with Col. Joseph Taylor,<hi rend="sup">56</hi> brother of Genl. Taylor
                                    whom he very much resembles. He was very kind to me. He is the son-in-law of Judge

                                    opperations, but on the whole is a noble, fine gentleman.</p>
                        <p>Feb. 9th, 1847. This day is only worth remembering because on it I received a letter

                        <p>Feb. 11th, 1847. This is the aniversary of my wedding with dear Joanna. I have
                                    thought today much of her &amp; of all the circumstances of becoming acquainted.
                                    Wrote her a letter in which I gave vent to some of [my] thoughts &amp; feelings
                                    on the occasion. Commenced to fortify the town considerable of an attack from the
                                    Mexicans. My only fear is of a surprize. If we have notice we will make their visit

                        <p>Feb. 12th, 1847. An alarm at night caused by the sentinel in the upper plaza fireing
                                    his gun. He saw 12 or 15 Mexicans in double file defileing past him. They were
                                    probably a party of robbers who have been appointed to collect a tax on goods
                                    imported into the interior, or it may be that they were a scouting party of

                        <p>Feb. 13th. Still progressing with our fortifications. If the Mexicans wait on us two
                                    days longer they may bring on their bears. We have today a report that there are
                                    fifteen hundred Mexican cavalry in our vicinity. We can take care of them if they
                                    come, but it is necessary to keep a sharp look. The men now disposed to work

                                    death &amp; devastation would all cease forever; if men in our Republic would

                                    &amp; very interesting.</p>
                        <p>Feb. 18th, 1847. Rain &amp; cold weather today. Witnessed the funeral of Senor
                                    Siron, former Alcade of this place. It was a very imposeing parade &amp; [a]
                                    great crowd attended of Mexicans &amp; Americans. It like every other ceremony
                                    or institution or sacrament of the Catholic Church seemed wholly addressed to the
                                    senses of the crowd &amp; was well calculated to captivate &amp; lead astray
                                    the unthinking. It did not seem to me to have any of the stern simplicity &amp;
                                    sublime spirituality of the true religion of the Poor Nazarine, but in charity let
                                    us hope that although we differ in many, very many respects <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>Feb. 19th, 1847. Capt. Roberts &amp; W. Hawkins<hi rend="sup">61</hi> died. A sad
                                    gloomy day. They died in the stranger's land far from home &amp; all
                                    its sweet associations, but they fell like soldiers at their post in discharge of
                                    their duty &amp; their grave was bedewed by tears from many a manly eye. They
                                    will rest as securely here as tho they had fallen in their own land. The loss of
                                    friends is deeply painful to me now but not so much as formerly, for now I have the
                                    sweet &amp; blessed hope that I shall be united to my dear friends in a brighter
                                    &amp; better world.</p>
                        <p>Feb. 20th, 1847. Wrote my dear Joan &amp; attended Capt. Roberts'
                                    funeral— a mournful occasion. The soldier has many, very many more trying
                                    things to do than to face an enemy in the field. Oh the horrors, the manifold
                                    &amp; countless horrors of war. No one can know them with actual experience.
                                    Still some alarms of an attack from the Mexicans. Slept none last night on account
                                    of the flees. It seems to me that if all the flees in the world could be collected
                                    together, at least one half of them would claim residence in Matamoros.</p>
                        <p>Feb. 21st, 1847. Beautiful weather. Nothing to register.</p>
                        <p>Feb. 22d, 1847. Capt. Lascelle<hi rend="sup">62</hi> gave a dinner to his company in

                                    made a short speech. The company requested a copy for publication. Furnished a copy
                                    for them to be published at home. This was perhaps the first celebration of the kind
                                    in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Feb. 23d. The Mexicans have not yet paid us a visit to retake the city &amp; all
                                    alarm on their account has ceased. The[y] will not come, I think. We are too well

                        <p>Feb. 24th, 1847. My birthday to day. I am thirty seven years old. Done nothing to
                                    signalize it. My time upon earth is in the ordinary course of things more than half
                                    past &amp; yet how little I have done to prepare for death. I will if the Lord

                        <p>Feb. 25th. Wrote to Menchaca the Alcalde for Col. Drake. Menchaca is a man of very
                                    respectable abilities but I would not trust him. Slight head-ache. The usual routine
                                    of duties. This day as past ones the same round of [drudge?] &amp; dulness

                        <p>Feb. 26th, 27th, &amp; 28th, 1847. Continual alarms at Matamoros, but no news as
                                    yet from Genl. Taylor &amp; no Mexicans have come to attack us. The
                                    Administration in their effort to ruin the reputation of Genl. Taylor have
                                    endangered this whole line of communication &amp; probably distroyed Genl.
                                    Taylor's whole army, &amp; in this unholy warfare upon Taylor I very
                                    much fear that Genl. Scott has lent himself the willing instrument. Received a
                                    letter from</p>
                        <p>March 1st, 1847. Every Mexican has a report of the battle between Taylor &amp;
                                    Santa Anna. Nothing reliable. We can't get a word from the army &amp;
                                    our condition is most painful, but we all believe that old Zack has done it up brown
                                    if he has retired, as I hear he has, before superior numbers. He has been like a

                        <p>March the 2, 3, 4th, 1847. We [are] all still apprehensive of an attack on this place
                                    &amp; Brazos St. Iago. When it will come no one can tell. I think we are ready.</p>

                        <p>March 6th, 1847. Capt. Ogden sent a letter from the mouth of the river to Matamoros
                                    that the Mexicans in great force were crossing the Rio Grande to attack that place.
                                    Eight companies were ordered on steam boats immediately to that place, &amp; I
                                    was by the order of Col. Drake placed in command. We ran all night &amp; very
                                    early in the morning arrived there. It turned out all smoke. They were more scared
                                    than hurt.</p>
                        <p>On the 7th of March we returned again to Matamoros. Found all quiet.</p>

                                    a life in others' breath." Oh the folly &amp; madness of man,
                                    rational man.</p>
                        <p>March 23d, 1847. This day passed over the ground. Capt. Smith's train was
                                    captured by Genl. Urea.<hi rend="sup">69</hi> Saw the whitening bones of our
                                    waggoners who were murdered in cold blood &amp; unarmed by the savage,
                                    treacherous, &amp; ignorant Mexicans. Most fearfully has this massacre been
                                    repaid by our troops. We passed Ramus &amp; Marinn<hi rend="sup">70</hi> today,
                                    fine flourishing towns which have been burned &amp; not an inhabitant remains in
                                    either. They look as if they had been visited by the angel of desolation. My
                                    feelings in passing them was gloomy beyond discription. This day encamped at Agua
                                    Fria.</p>
                        <p>March the 24th. Left our last encamped &amp; marched on for seve[r]al hours when
                                    about 11 o'clock our troops saw about one hundred lancers &amp; we all
                                    again prepared for an immediate attack in high glee at the prospect of a fight. But
                                    again we were doomed to be disappointed, for the lancers retired &amp; we
                                    pursued our journey quietly to Genl. Taylor's camp [at] the Walnut Springs
                                    where we arrived about an hour by sun &amp; pitched our tents in a most
                                    beautiful grove abounding in fine springs of fresh water. This camp is six miles
                                    from Monterey &amp; is altogether the most pleasant encampment we have yet had
                                    in Mexico.</p>
                        <p>March 25th. Visited Genl. Taylor. He received me very kindly &amp; promised that
                                    if there was another fight during our term of service our regiment should bear a
                                    part in it, when I saw before me a plain farmer-like looking old man with nothing
                                    like military dress on, in a coarse check shirt, grey pants, &amp; slouched hat.
                                    I could hardly realize that he was the hero of a nation &amp; age &amp; that
                                    I then saw a future President <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>March 27th, 1847. Wrote to day to my dear Joan, looked at her portrait, read her
                                    letters, &amp; thought of home, built castles in the air, lived over again the

                        <p>March the 28th. Visited Monterey &amp; took dinner. Got tired &amp; returned

                        <p>March the 29th. Remain[ed] in camp &amp; drilled the regiment.</p>
                        <p>March the 30th. Drilled the regiment &amp; lounged about camp.</p>
                        <p>March the 31st. Rode out in the morning with James Wilson<hi rend="sup">71</hi> on
                                    our Mexican poneys. This day the regiment was paid off &amp; all kept sober with
                                    perhaps a few exceptions.</p>
                        <p>April 1st, 1847. A fine spring morning. Again rode out with James for five miles
                                    towards the mountains. Enjoyed the fine air &amp; fine mountain prospects which
                                    opened upon us.</p>
                        <p>April 2d, 3d. Nothing worthy [of] note. Rode out morning &amp; evening. As usual
                                    in the evening Col. Drake received an order from Genl. Taylor to march the regiment
                                    to Caderita<hi rend="sup">72</hi> to defend a train which he had heard was to be

                        <p>April 4th. The regiment took up the line of march &amp; travelled 20 miles. Saw
                                    no hostile Mexicans. Had a stampede at night. Slept on the ground in the open air.
                                    Got up at 3 o'clock in the morning &amp; bathed in the San Juan River

                        <p>April 5th, 1847. Learned that there was no danger of the train's being

                                    whom we had left sick. To day received a letter from my <hi rend="i">dear dear</hi>
                                    Joan. I can see in every letter a great improovement in her style of composition, an
                                    increased vigor of thought, and enlarged views of things, but in all that relates to
                                    the heart she is, thank God, the same. All love &amp; trust, truth &amp;
                                    tenderness. Received also today her presents, those dear testimonials of love
                                    &amp; regard which to me have a value beyond all the world's wealth.
                                    Received presents also from the family &amp; protestations of friendship which I
                                    most fully reciprocate &amp; highly prize. A letter also from Sylvia &amp;
                                    the buttons, [from] Grandma &amp; the darning kneedles &amp; yarn, some
                                    smart sayings from Mary &amp; [Lou ?]. Joan wrote to me that Ma was going to <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                                    </placeName> to take Lou &amp; the two youngest children. I regret this as it
                                    will prolong the time of my seeking them several weeks or perhaps months. Thought of
                                    home until I am decidedly home sick &amp; what is still worse I have my fears as
                                    to whether I shall get any better until I try the effect of a northern climate.
                                    Capt. Evans lost the pamphlets my Joan sent me to read, which is quite a loss here.</p>
                        <p>April 6th, 1847. Spent to day in reading "The Poets &amp; Poetry of
                                    America." A great treat here, but at home no great shakes of a book after
                                    all. The weather warmer here today than in Indiana in August.</p>
                        <p>April 7th. Went [to] San Nicholas,<hi rend="sup">74</hi> a fine pleasant village five
                                    miles from the camp, in company with Col. Drake &amp; Lt. Wallace. The houses
                                    &amp; gardens here neat &amp; tasteful, the women handsomer than Mexican
                                    ladies generally are, but oh that word "but," there is always some
                                    but. But I had almost forgot to tell what the present war is. Well, the
                                    women— candor compels me to say that much for them— but I must
                                    tell they all wear their petticoat so as to show their breasts to the lewd or
                                    conniveing gaze of all beholders, but it is only a way they have &amp; I fear
                                    they have some other ways which would be rather disreputable in the states.</p>
                        <p>April 8. Took a ride with Capt. May. A thunder shower in the evening— the
                                    first rain we had seen for 8 months &amp; the first thunder we had heard in the

                        <p>April 13th, 1847. The same as yesterday only more anxious if possible to return home
                                        <hi rend="i">to my sweet home</hi> &amp; the dear little wife. I think of
                                    her until my weak &amp; tired brain reels with the consciousness of the time
                                    &amp; space which separates us. Absence is now no longer a mere uneasiness or
                                    disquietude but is a sense of postive pain &amp; conscious &amp; liveing

                        <p>April 15th, 1847. Remained in camp today &amp; read Shell[e]y. To metaphysical
                                    for me &amp; too dark too. There is in his works a vein of infidelity more dark
                                    &amp; more dangerous than I had ever discovered before. I was not in the proper
                                    frame of mind to read this book &amp; never was so little pleased with it
                                    before. In genius he is an angel but an angel fallen. His only object seems to be to
                                    shut out the light of God's revelation &amp; leave mankind to grope
                                    their way thro this vale of tears in night &amp; in darkness. There is a
                                    brilliancy about his imagination but it is a brilliancy caught from the false light
                                    of French phylosophy &amp; haveing no kindred with the true light which is from
                                    Heaven, the sun of righteousness which alone can pierce the deep gloom which
                                    overhangs sin-bruised mortality.</p>
                        <p>April 16th, 1847. Dined by special invitation with Genl. Taylor. Was much pleased at
                                    my reception. He is a plain man in his manners &amp; has the rare faculty of
                                    making everyone, however humble, at ease in his presence. He does not fence himself
                                    in by any false dignity. He talks rather clumsily but his excellence is that he can
                                    do. He spoke freely of the Administration, of of Genl. Scott, &amp; their
                                    conduct towards him in the conduct of the war. He is no politician in any party
                                    sense of that word but he is what is far better—an American. He loves his
                                    whole country too well to give himself to any portion of it. His predilections are
                                    for the Whig policy &amp; his associations are with the Whig party. He is Whig
                                    enough for me &amp; patriot enough for any &amp; every American. If he lives
                                    he will be our next President &amp; woe, woe to the mere politician who attempts
                                    to stand between the people &amp; the man on whom those choose to bestow their
                                    gratitude <pb n="425" id="VAA4025-053-4-075"/> for signal military services. The

                        <p>April 17th, 1847. Tired waiting for a mail from home. It has been more than two
                                    months since the date of my last letter from the one loved one. Wrote to my wife
                                    today. Just recovering from a severe spell of sick head ache. I love my wife at all
                                    times but oh I do feel the want of her presence when I am sick. My messmates May

                        <p>April 18th, 1847. Sunday. Read 6 chapters of the Book Ezekiel. Could make nothing of

                                    finding out. Rode to Monterey in the evening. Disappointed in the arrival of the

                        <p>April 19th, 1847. Ten months since we were mustered into service. Hope to [be] at <placeName>

                                    intimation from Genl. Taylor as to when we shall start for home, I will write to
                                    Joan to come south to meet me. A slight touch of rheumatism in the right shoulder.
                                    Getting up a trip in company with Col. Drake to see the battlefield at Bona Vista.
                                    Getting homesick &amp; that right smartly too. Still, if I get home in my
                                    present state of health I shall not regret the campaign altho I shall not make it
                                    when I expected or intended. Rode out. There is one thing which must strike the most
                                    casual observer here, &amp; that is the air of decay which seems to pervade
                                    everything here. The town seem to be out of order &amp; prematurely old. Their
                                    are no new houses or improovements of any kind. Their farms &amp; ranches seem
                                    to be going fast to ruin; no young orchards or fruit trees; gardens neglected; their
                                    implements of agriculture are all of primitive patterns, rude, awkward, &amp;
                                    unserviceable; their domestic animals for want of attention are of poor breeds
                                    &amp; almost worthless. There is a word nothing like improovement, or progress
                                    in the arts [of] agriculture [or] of manufactures. All seem at a dead standstill or
                                    rather <list type="footnotes">

                                    state of things is superinduced or brought about by the unstable &amp; violent
                                    character of the government, its frequent revolutions &amp; revulsions. There is
                                    here no security for personal property or personal rights. The people only feel the
                                    hand of the government in its confiscations &amp; oppressions. The Army declares
                                    in favor of some leader who promises that if successful he will pay up all their
                                    arrearages. He then commences a revolution &amp; all who refuse to join are in
                                    the end forced to pay the soldiers their property confiscated, &amp; [are] often
                                    imprisoned themselves. Opposition to violent rule of these temporary despots is
                                    construed into opposition to the Republic &amp; made treason. A government thus
                                    forced the joint result of fraud &amp; force cannot be permanent. Another
                                    revolution soon succeeds, of the same character. The people have nothing like a
                                    permanent government. They have no security that their industry or enterprize will
                                    enure to their own benefit. They [have] no inducement to labour for the purpose of
                                    acquireing any property more than a bare subsistence. Those who sow in peace have no
                                    security that they will be permitted to reap in peace. Hence, a kind of national
                                    indolence pervades the whole people. Another reason for the depressed state of
                                    agriculture is that those who till the soil do not own it; it is cultivated by peons
                                    who are enslaved for debt, a slavery worse by far than the slavery of the African
                                    race in the <placeName>
                                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                                    </placeName>. Unless men are interested in the result of their labours they do but
                                    little, nor do that little well. The frequent revolutions which distract &amp;
                                    desolate this unhappy country seem peculiar to those provinces which were originally
                                    settled by the Spaniards &amp; when that social, political, religious, &amp;
                                    moral incubus (Catholicism) prevails no people can ever be free with a religion
                                    established by law. If men are taught from their infancy to believe that they have
                                    spiritual superiors, that the priest stands between them &amp; their God, they
                                    will be easily persuaded to recognize temporal superiors. This seems to follow as a
                                    natural if not an inevitable consequence. If you would fit men for self government
                                    make them free, body &amp; soul, at the same time that you give them freedom in
                                    temporal affairs. Break every chain which fetters the soul. If there is any cure for
                                    the manifold evils which curse this illfated country, it will be found in the
                                    principle of universal toleration. Religion thus free, unfettered, &amp;
                                    unconnected <pb n="427" id="VAA4025-053-4-077"/> with the State is the harbinger of
                                    free government &amp; free institutions, but that monster which is miscalled
                                    religion, which connects itself with temporal power, userps high places, &amp;
                                    whose sceptre is the blood-stained sword, is the most stupendous &amp; monstrous
                                    evil which has ever blighted &amp; blasted the fair face of human society. If
                                    the time shall ever come when all the various sects of Christianity shall be
                                    tolerated here, then &amp; not till then may we hope for the establishment of a
                                    permanently free government in Mexico. But judgeing from present appearances that
                                    happy event is yet afar off.</p>
                        <p>April 20th, 1847. A heavy rain. The rainy season is upon us. Rumors of another fight
                                    at Saltillo which I do not believe, but if there is to be another fight, God grant
                                    that the 1st. Indiana Regiment may be in it. I am threatened with a return of
                                    dyspepsia. It cannot be the result of high living, for the camp fare does not afford
                                    much to tempt the appetite. But my theory is that too much food of any kind will
                                    cause dyspepsia, especially if no exercise is taken. Preparing to leave for Saltillo
                                    to see the Bona Vista battlefield, that of Taylor's glory &amp;
                                    volunteer chilvalry. It is hard to be permitted to see great battlefields only after
                                    the battles have been fought which have made them memorable. Much has been said
                                    about the conduct of the Second Indiana Regiment in the Battle of Bona Vista. I have
                                    listened to all that has been said, I think as impartially as any Indianian could,
                                    &amp; have come to this conclusion: that the regiment fought as well as any
                                    regiment in the field &amp; that if Col. Bowles<hi rend="sup">79</hi> had not
                                    given that ill advised &amp; unfortunate order to retreat, no possible reproach
                                    could have attached to the regiment. The court of enquiry has set all to rights. The

                        <p>April 21st, 1847. Went to Monterey on my way to Saltillo. Abandoned the trip. Waited
                                    for letters. Got none. Become acquainted with Col. Hamtramck.<hi rend="sup">80</hi>
                                    Much pleased with him. He seems to be an excellent gentleman &amp; is said to be
                                    a fine officer. Last night wrote to my dear Joan to meet me at <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>April 23d, 1847. Wrote to Joan again by James Willson. Received a letter from her, a
                                    good sweet letter just like her. The man who has a good wife needs nothing else to

                        <p>April 24th, 1847. Quite sick of billious cholic. Took opium in large quantities. The

                                    with murder &amp; battle &amp; sudden death.</p>
                        <p>April 25th. Sunday. Yet sick. Stayed in my tent all day. Better towards evening. Lost

                        <p>April 27th, 1847. An attack of ague &amp; fever, quite severe. Broke it up with
                                    quinine. Took calomol in small quantities to excite the liver to a healthy action.
                                    Not much effect on the liver but the effect very visible upon my gums—
                                    badly salivated.</p>
                        <p>April 28th. No appetite, getting weaker, tendency to fever, very sore mouth,
                                    &amp; weather intolerably hot. Every thing about the [camp] anything but
                                    comfortable for a sick man, but to go to Monterey [would be] still worse.</p>
                        <p>April 29th. Found my horse. Wrote a letter to Joan. Rather better, but the heat most
                                    oppressive &amp; the fleas worse than any person unacquainted with this wretched
                                    country can possibly imagine. Before going to bed we caught over fifty which did
                                    seem to lessen the number only to exasperate the survivors, for this night it seemed

                        <p>April 30th. Mustered in for pay. The health of our troops good. My own health

                                    see? This picture is always overlooked in our account of war, but if it could be
                                    seen &amp; felt it would melt the icy &amp; stoney heart of even political

                                    war should have the indignant thunders of outraged humanity sounding in their ear
                                    during this life, &amp; during the life to come they should have the unending

                        <p>May the 1st, 1847. May day. Oh what a happy day is this in my own loved village. I
                                    can almost hear the sweet chime of the bells &amp; the sweeter voice of
                                    innocence &amp; childhood, &amp; I can almost see the smiling faces of the
                                    happy groups as the[y] are assembling under the old forrest trees, &amp; I <pb n="430" id="VAA4025-053-4-080"/> seem to breathe the odours of those flowers
                                    which kind Nature has with more than maternal kindness in my own, my native land. Oh
                                    well do I remember May day three years ago. It was then that I first found among a
                                    gay &amp; happy throng her who has since been the flower of my existence, the
                                    adored object of my devotion. But now I am afar off where no sweet faces smile upon
                                    me, no music greets my ear, no flowers breathe for me their sweetness. Still I will
                                    live upon the memories of the past. Whatere bitide, I have been blessed. I will
                                    listen to the angel melodies of the sweet singer hope until by fancies'
                                    magic touch all those bright &amp; winged hours are mine again.</p>
                        <p>May the 2d, 1847. Cool, pleasant day &amp; my ague over. Rode into town with Col.
                                    Drake &amp; Capt. Evans after supper. Got a cup of chocolate very far superior
                                    to any chocolate I ever before had tasted. Either the material is very superior or
                                    there is an art in the makeing which our people have not found out. Heard reports in
                                    town comeing from the Mexicans of a decissive battle having been fought between
                                    Genls. Scott &amp; Santa Anna in which both generals were killed &amp; in
                                    which our army was greatly worsted. Do not believe it, but if this report should
                                    turn out to be true we shall yet have plenty of hard fighting on this line as the
                                    enemy if they have checked Scott will no doubt attack our posts on the Rio Grande,
                                    &amp; then our government may perhaps wake up to the importance of the war in
                                    which we are engaged &amp; cease to carry it on in [the] pickeune way which they
                                    have done heretofore if they intend to invade the city of Mexico. We now have in the
                                    field at least seventy-five thousand troops. The war can never be ended as it is at
                                    present conducted unless the Mexicans choose to terminate it.</p>
                        <p>May the 3d, 1847. Went to town. Called to see Cols. Mitchel,84 Weller,85 &amp;
                                    Hamtramack—all very courteous &amp; clever. Hamtramack is the best
                                    officer, Weller a man of the most talents, &amp; Mitchel dresses better than
                                    either of the others. Mitchel is governor of the town &amp; he takes the office
                                    very hard, but he is young &amp; very good looking, &amp; a long way from
                                    home, has been in a battle, &amp; is to be excused.</p>

                        <p>May 4th, 1847. Rumours are still afloat of the battle between Scott &amp; Santa
                                    Anna. We are all anxiety to hear the truth. We do not credit the Mexican reports in
                                    full but still have our fears. A great battle has in all probability been fought
                                    &amp; I fear our forces have suffered repulse; tho truth is, after occupying <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Vera Cruz</settlement>
                                    </placeName> &amp; Alvarado, Scott had not force enough to march upon Mexico,
                                    &amp; if he has done so I can but dread the result. Our uninterrupted success
                                    has spoiled the Administration &amp; spoiled our generals too. They underrate
                                    the enemy &amp; all hands will, I fear, before long be taught a sore lesson. Why
                                    not bring an army here instead of a handful of men? Why not make a demonstration of
                                    power which will awe Mexico &amp; show the world what Americans are? We should
                                    make this a short &amp; glorious war for the moral effect it would have upon
                                    Europe, &amp; we should look to that &amp; be ready for that great conflict
                                    of opinion which will come in our day &amp; generation.</p>
                        <p>May 5th. Dull day, drizzelling rain. Got two letters from Joan, the first cheerful

                                    prey to such gloom &amp; despondence &amp; all the horrors of suspense. She
                                    imagines the worst. Oh that she could this moment know that all is well. I shall, I
                                    hope, soon be permitted to rejoin her, never more to be parted never, no never. How
                                    foolish it was in me to leave her &amp; all the sweet endearments of home in
                                    quest of fame which ever flies when most we pursue. But enough of vain regrets. I
                                    will do so no more. I am cured of ambition &amp; do not fear a relapse.</p>
                        <p>May the 6th. Pleasant mild weather. Good health &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>May 7th, 1847. Went to Monterey. Rumors that Scott has defeated Santa Anna.</p>
                        <p>May the 8th, 1847. Called to see Genl. Taylor. The anniversary of the Battle of Palo
                                    Alto. We have been one year engaged in war, have gained seven battles, have lost
                                    many men &amp; killed many more of the enemy, have taken more than half of their
                                    territory including a great many important towns, all of their sea ports, &amp;
                                    still we have not conquered a peace &amp; our government is more sick of the war
                                    &amp; more desirous for peace than are the Mexicans. It is a war waged by us at
                                    vast expense bringing no results fruitful in what men call military distinction but
                                    in nothing else except in bearing unmixed evil.</p>

                        <p>May 9th, 1847. Sunday. Heard from Genl. Scott's column. Our arms have again
                                        triumphed.<hi rend="sup">86</hi> The Mexicans are even worse defeated than ever,
                                    haveing lost all their arms, artillery, munitions of war, &amp; lost besides
                                    many prisoners. This victory will place Scott on high ground as a general &amp;
                                    it may be that it will exercise a happy influence upon our prospects of peace. From
                                    the Mexican account their army has been totally routed &amp; is disorganized.
                                    They cannot for some time get up another force large enough to meet either Scott or
                                    Taylor, but if they choose they may make gurilla war upon us &amp; protract this
                                    war for long years to come. Visited to day Cols. Mitchel &amp; Weller of <placeName>

                                    soon leave.</p>
                        <p>May the 11th. Went to Monterey with Major Morrison<hi rend="sup">89</hi> &amp;
                                    Lt. Smith.<hi rend="sup">90</hi> Had something like sunstroke. Near fai[n]ting,

                        <p>May the 12th, 1847. Genl. Taylor today decided that our regiment should be disbanded
                                    on the Rio Grande. That will give me about a hundred more pay, but I would rather
                                    get home or to <placeName>

                                    furlough ten or fifteen days before the regiment gets of[f]. I am doing no good by
                                    staying &amp; might just as well go where I know I can at least make one true

                        <p>May the 19th, 1847. Came to Canales's run. Found a Mexican with some fine
                                    honey which we purchased of him. Still sick &amp; worn out with travel but the

            <p>As a youth, listless Jimmy Polk was scrawny, weak, pallid, and often in pain. In 1812, he rode
                    horseback 230 miles from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> up to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, and the plain white house of Ephraim McDowell.
                    There, without benefit of anesthesia or antisepsis, the teenager from the Duck River country
                    underwent a gallstone operation at the hands of a surgical pioneer. The stone was removed, and it is
                    conceivable that roughly one-fifth of the continental <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would not be American today if the good doctor's knife had slipped or if his
                    skill had forsaken him.</p>
            <p>Although Polk never became robust, the operation was a pivot on which his life turned. The following
                    summer at seventeen he entered an "academy," studying with new-found energy and
                    compensating for time lost to illness. He later moved on to a better school; to the University of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName>; to Felix Grundy's law office in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and then to politics and Congress itself. Serving fourteen years in the federal House
                    of Representatives, McDowell's erstwhile patient was Speaker for two terms and then
                    Governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>. If deficient in the personal magnetism of a Daniel Webster or a Henry Clay, Polk had
                    other qualities which commended him to voters. In 1844, as the Democratic nominee, he defeated the
                    redoubtable "Harry of the West" for the Presidency of the <placeName>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">James K. Polk, Jacksonian</hi> ends in the autumn of 1843, shortly after his second
                    defeat for re-election as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>'s governor. On the surface, it might seem that setbacks in his own bailiwick
                    would have made Polk unavailable for the presidential palm. But so deftly has Professor Sellers
                    recreated the political scene that the reader is prepared for what will doubtless develop in a
                    second volume. Although the author keeps his eye on his man and never strays far from his side,
                    Martin Van Buren and John C. Calhoun enter the account much as they actually entered Folk's
                    life—proof, <pb n="438" id="VAA4025-053-4-088"/> indeed, of Sellers' skill.
                    Doughty "Old Hickory" Jackson, too, tubercular and toothless but forceful as ever,
                    lingers on at the Hermitage. And from all that has been revealed about Polk in this first part of
                    the story—his tenacity, self-discipline, courage, and adroitness—it will
                    scarcely be a surprise when triumph follows on the heels of failure.</p>
            <p>It would be a mistake, however, to exaggerate national overtones. Here the principal setting is <placeName>

                    the historian has distilled freshness and truth. The Erwin-Carroll-Williams-Cannon political group
                    and the Overton-Eaton-Lewis clique are among the combinations clarified. The reader meets men he
                    expects to meet—Polk himself, Jackson, Hugh Lawson White, Colonel Davy Crockett, and
                    "Lean Jimmy" Jones. The roles and personalities of Alfred Balch, James Walker,
                    Judge John Catron, and the obscure Edmund Rucker are also presented. Though the scholar has dug
                    deeply, there is nothing obtrusive in his product. Humorous comments enliven the narrative. Early

                    five—states to the Union. He is one of the few soldiers in American military

                    country" (p. 340).</p>
            <p>The present volume is the result of extensive research and study, possibly wider research than the
                    author's predecessors. In places it is heavily documented. It is interesting to read as a
                    life of Clark should be. The author has been trained in history, has had experience in magazine
                    editing, in military and foreign service. He is also the author of seven previous books, a majority
                    of which were in the field of history. Two of them are concerned with the frontier.</p>
            <p>Unusual and inadequate documentation in places, however, characterize the volume. The fault is not
                    only the unusual form of the footnotes, but the lack of information found in them. The critical
                    reader cannot tell in many instances whether the manuscript referred to was a writing of
                    Clark's or something produced by somebody's grandmother some eighty years after
                    the fact about something told her when she was a child. At places one also finds a lack of
                    supporting references.</p>
            <p>The work is furthermore characterized by an emphasis on legendary information. The Teresa de Leyba
                    story of Clark's supposed love affair is not only told but brought up again and again. When
                    the British attacked <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1780, the author inserts in his narrative: "Romantic legend has grown up
                    around this swift visit [of Clark] to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was the last time Clark would ever see Teresa de Leyba. <pb n="440" id="VAA4025-053-4-090"/> There is no proof that he really did see her in this crisis…
                    . But of their last meeting—which must have taken place at this time—there is
                    no record that he ever said a word" (pp. 248-249). Actually even Clark's presence
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> is disputed, not to mention a tete-a-tete at the time of battle. Another piece of
                    legend appears on page 252: "This time, he escaped by a dazzling piece of bluff. The story
                    is familiar and well attested, but time and place are not clear. It seems to have happened at this
                    very time." How is a story well attested without time and place? The author's
                    enthusiasm for the dramatic statement also entrapped him in a contradiction. "It is of
                    record that, in all his [Clark] warring years, his reconnaissance was always perfect. No enemy ever
                    caught him unawares" (p. 70). But on page 252 he wrote: "Only twice in his life
                    did the cunning red men lure him into ambush."</p>
            <p>The book will make a stronger appeal for the reader interested in the story than for the critical
                    historian.</p>

            <p>Any of us who ventures upon a biography of a figure who lacked outstanding importance, or a very
                    interesting personality, or the flexibility to acknowledge the imperium of change, is confronted by
                    a far more difficult task than the biographers of strong leaders, or of warm personalities, or of
                    adaptable individuals who rode the crest of the wave on the rising tide of events. Where a figure is
                    more important for the persons with whom he associated than for himself, his biographer must squeeze
                    every possible drop of juice that he can from the fruits of greater acquaintances; and the
                    chronicle—if honest—cannot be highly flavorsome.</p>
            <p>Baxter's is an honest chronicle of a not-very-attractive lawyer-politician of less than
                    first rank who, probably unwittingly, greatly handicapped his biographer. This Browning in the
                    challenging year of 1861, in the prime of life at age 55, yielded to some strong compulsion and
                    "disposed of a great many of his letters and papers" (p. 333). Did his
                    supercilious exterior cloak a basic unsureness as to the validity of his own decisions?</p>
            <pb n="441" id="VAA4025-053-4-091"/>
            <p>Also, toward his own Diary Browning displayed an attitude of reserve. In it he barely mentions that
                    Lincoln-Douglas debate in his home town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>
                    </placeName>, when they were his houseguests, but he absented himself, attending court at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Carthage</settlement>
                    </placeName> (pp. 94, 301). Another example: he left untold how he solved his quandary of whether to
                    vote for Lincoln or McClellan in 1864 (p. 159). At least the Diary omissions unintentially provide a
                    good foundation for Baxter's conclusion that this associate who took pride in close
                    relations with prominent personages suffered jealousy toward them, especially Lincoln (pp. 99, 174).
                    The "friend and critic" here portrayed was a complicated person and data thus far
                    uncovered scarcely suffices for a full analysis of the help and hindrance Lincoln had from him.</p>
            <p>Like many another office-seeker politician, Browning repeatedly denied that he wanted preferment; for
                    example, he wrote Trumbull in 1856, "I always had uncontrolable [sic] repugnancies to
                    political life" (p. 88). He persuades even Baxter that after the 1862 elections ousted him
                    from his Senate seat, "on the whole, however, he was happy at the prospect of going
                    home" (p. 151); so happy that he made no farewell call on Lincoln, their relations being
                    strained by political differences.</p>
            <p>Manfully confronting such diverse biographical obstacles, Baxter produced a dissertation under James
                    G. Randall in 1948 and industriously combed out Browning material from the manuscripts of such
                    luminaries as Simon Cameron, James Doolittle, Thomas Ewing, Sr., Andrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln,
                    and Lyman Trumbull, besides Gideon Welles' vinegarish Diary. Also useful, as this enlarged,
                    published version shows, were manuscripts of some fourteen lesser lights, archives of railroads,
                    court records, and pertinent secondary materials. From this data Baxter developed a fair estimate of
                    Abraham Lincoln's "friend," Andrew Johnson's Secretary of the
                    Interior and Attorney General, and the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> counsel.</p>
            <p>The author is sympathetic but very rarely too friendly. His analysis of Browning, the unyielding
                    conservative, is often acute (for example, chapter four, "Sketch of a Gentleman,"
                    pp. 51–65, 152, 245, 273, 285). However, Browning's brand of
                    inconsistency—that universal trait—sometimes leaves the reader, and Baxter, a
                    little puzzled; puzzled, for example, about how this lifelong Whig (and Browning never ceased to <pb n="442" id="VAA4025-053-4-092"/> be a Whig, though he lived until 1881) balanced his positions
                    on state and federal functioning in the field of internal improvements (pp. 10–26, 57,
                    70, 77, 223).</p>
            <p>The biography demonstrates repeatedly the stubborn fact that intricate processes of political
                    adjustment cannot submit to full documentation. Baxter's account of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> state politics in the 1830's and 1840's, when Browning occasionally
                    served as senator and representative, is skeletal probably because <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, like numerous other states, is poorly documented in that period. Also the Diary, such
                    as it is, begins only in 1851, when Browning was 46, and is disappointing at critical junctures. For
                    the dramatic events around May 18, 1860, when the Republicans nominated Lincoln and Browning was
                    espousing him, although Browning's first choice was Bates, the leaf for May 18 is missing
                    from the Diary pages and the account is cursory. Also missing are the leaves for June
                    9–13, 1861, when Browning's appointment to Douglas' vacant Senate chair
                    was consummated; nor does the extant Diary mention this appointment until fifteen days after it
                    occurred. Perhaps a little-known fact, unmentioned by Baxter, accounts for some of the Diary
                    lacunae: the Diary entered the public domain under a stipulation that no criticism of Mrs. Lincoln
                    should be conveyed therefrom.</p>
            <p>On the whole, the greatest value of this biography derives from the fact that most of the persons
                    engaged in political maneuvering escape greatness; whenever we can learn something of one of these
                    prominent non-greats we are helped in our endeavors toward realism. It is to be hoped, however, that
                    we shall rarely be proffered a biography destitute of either any picture of the subject or of any
                    chronological summary, in index or out, of his major experiences. Lastly, may no one ever imitate a
                    note-numbering which recommences at number one numerous times within every chapter.</p>

            <p>"Why did Lincoln, in his single term in Congress, come short of success? What errors of
                    judgment did he make— wrong judgments of party policy, failure to make correct <pb n="443" id="VAA4025-053-4-093"/> estimates of the views of his constituents, mistakes in the
                    evaluation of colleagues and of party leaders? And what elements of personal character did Lincoln
                    have to enable him to accept failure and rebuff in good humor, with no diminution in his loyal
                    support of his party and its leaders—even of those responsible for his own ill
                    treatment—without complaint and without recrimination?" These and other
                    interesting questions are answered in Professor Riddle's latest book on this almost
                    overlooked chapter of the Lincoln story.</p>
            <p>Briefly, answers to the questions concerning his failure to succeed and errors of judgment are these.
                    Lincoln offered his Spot Resolutions which were presented to embarrass Polk by focusing attention
                    upon what the Whigs thought was a weak point in his case for the justification of the Mexican War.
                    The response to the Resolutions in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> was prompt and negative. The sobriquet, "Spotty," stuck to Lincoln
                    throughout his political life in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. In less than two weeks Lincoln voted "aye" on the Ashmun Amendment
                    which labeled the Mexican War as "unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the
                    President." A short time later he made a full-length speech entitled "The War With
                    Mexico" which was severely critical of Folk's war policy, bitter in its references
                    to Polk, and negative in its attitude toward the war. Lincoln's Seventh District in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> was justifiably baffled when they remembered that Lincoln had supported the war during
                    his congressional campaign.</p>
            <p>Professor Riddle correctly concludes that Lincoln's brief career in Congress forced his own
                    retirement for several years, diminished his party's strength in the state, and delivered
                    the one dependable Whig stronghold in <placeName>

            <p>This new book, according to the author, was written to serve two purposes: to further the
                    understanding of Abraham Lincoln and to aid Lincoln's biographers. The author has served
                    these purposes well by presenting Lincoln in the full context of the historical situations which
                    occurred during his congressional career. He includes a detailed discussion of western expansion,
                    the Mexican War, the administrative policies of Polk, the changing of political party alignments,
                    and the increased tension of the slavery issue. He has also used all available sources for his
                    limited subject, and, as a result, <pb n="444" id="VAA4025-053-4-094"/> has made it unnecessary for
                    Lincoln's biographers to repeat the painstaking research that has gone into this study.
                    Both purposes are served by an excellent bibliography and index.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Congressman Abraham Lincoln</hi> is a continuation of an earlier work, Lincoln Runs for
                    Congress, published in 1948. In the earlier work Professor Riddle presented a study of
                    Lincoln's campaign for nomination and election to Congress as a report of an episode in
                    western history, rather than as a chapter of Lincoln biography. The book tells briefly the story of
                    Lincoln's two attempts and successful third campaign, 1843-1846, to win election to the
                    House as a Whig.</p>

            <p>Since Halvdan Koht moved from his birthplace in Tromso to southern Norway some seventy-two years ago,
                    he has never allowed himself to be rooted in one spot or limited to the narrow confines of one field
                    of historical specialization. Although he was thoroughly trained in Norwegian and medieval history
                    in Norway and abroad by such masters as Sophus Bugge, Karl Lamprecht, and Gabriel Monod, his
                    intellectual curiosity and almost universal interests soon led him to such divers fields of
                    scholarship and practical activity as literature, mythology, politics, and linguistic controversy.
                    Accordingly, his publications treat a wide variety of subjects ranging from old Norse sagas to
                    Bismarck, from Ibsen and Wergeland to Norwegian social and economic history, and from the history of
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to modern Scandinavian diplomatic history. While writing articles and books on these
                    and other topics, he was active, at various times during his life, as a journalist, editor of the
                        <hi rend="i">Dictionary of Norwegian Authors,</hi> professor of history at the University of
                    Oslo, and a prominent figure in the Norwegian Labor Party (he was Norwegian foreign minister in 1940
                    when Hitler attacked Norway).</p>
            <p>Two threads of thought run throughout his works: Norwegian nationalism and the role of class conflict
                    in history. From an early date in his life Koht became interested <pb n="445" id="VAA4025-053-4-095"/> in the <hi rend="i">landsmål</hi> movement, which aimed at replacing the artificial
                    Dano-Norwegian language spoken among educated Norwegians at the time with a more national form of
                    speech based on the language of the people. His interest in popular dialects and the life of the
                    common people turned his attention more and more to the historic struggle of the Norwegian peasant
                    for national independence from <placeName>
                        <country reg="dk">Denmark</country>
                    </placeName>. His trip to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1908–1909 made him aware that the struggle of the Norwegian peasant was
                    not the only example of social conflict in history. This new awareness gradually brought him to the
                    conclusion that class struggle was one of the prime movers of history and to the conviction that the
                    socialist program of the Norwegian Labor Party was the one which most nearly corresponded to the
                    needs of Norway in the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>Although the American reader will not always agree with Koht on socialism and the role of class
                    conflict in history, every historian can read this work with profit. <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> historians will be particularly interested in Koht's often penetrating remarks
                    concerning this country in his thirty-six page chapter on the America of Eugene Debs, Samuel
                    Gompers, William Jennings Bryan, and Oliver Wendell Holmes. However, the major contribution of
                    Koht's book does not lie in the light it sheds on <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history but rather in his skillful analysis of the training, forces, and life
                    experiences that made him a historian and in his subtle demonstration of a point that historians in
                    all countries can well learn: if one is to study the history of his own nation intelligently,
                    "he must have broad perspectives outward, so that he can compare and understand"

                    </placeName>. Several more volumes pertaining to the same territory are to follow. Since 1931 the
                    publication of this series has continued with <pb n="446" id="VAA4025-053-4-096"/> what cost to the
                    American taxpayers we are not informed. This reviewer would like to oppose, as exhibits of money
                    wasted, the inclusion of numerous recommendations of little known people for appointment to
                    insignificant offices; of a number of petitions about minor matters which were never presented to
                    any legislative body or ranking executive official; and abstracts for grand and petit jurors which
                    required page after page to publish. There are other types of territorial papers included which, for
                    the information they convey or the utility they will have, might well have been deleted.</p>
            <p>For convenience of reading and facility of study the text is divided into four major parts. The first
                    part contains papers relating to the transition from Spanish to American rule. These papers deal
                    with such problems as defense, fortifications, runaway slaves, commerce, Indians, and territorial
                    appointments. Also included is the treaty of acquisition.</p>
            <p>The second section of this long volume contains papers that relate to the administration of Governor
                    Andrew Jackson. Many of these papers deal with Jackson's clash with Judge Fromentin. The
                    irate judge wrote John Q. Adams, Secretary of State, that the American flag of liberty as
                    represented by Governor Jackson was "a treacherous sign in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>" (p. 189). Jackson soon tired of his gubernatorial responsibilities, named
                    Walton and Worthington as acting governors of West and East <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> respectively, resigned his office and returned to <placeName>

            <p>The third part contains papers relating to the administration of Acting Governors Worthington and
                    Walton. Significantly, Worthington abolished imprisonment for debts in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> on July 4, 1822. During 1822 many appointments were made, numerous land claims were
                    validated or discredited, Key West was designated as a port of entry, and a collector of customs
                    appointed.</p>
            <p>The last section presents papers about the first administration of Governor Du Val,
                    1822–1825. Among the problems discussed are relations with the Indians, territorial
                    organization, the militia, the epidemic of malignant fever, transportation, and runaway slaves.</p>
            <p>Some of these papers will be read by students and used by research scholars but many of them have

            <p>No better picture of how one culture interacts with another and helps to mold and give impetus to
                    movements and ideas within the receiving culture may be seen than in Henry A. Pochmann's
                        <hi rend="i">German Culture in America, 1600–1900.</hi> It may come as a surprise to
                    some that German influences were felt in America as early as the seventeenth century when the new
                    country was still struggling to its feet. But Professor Pochmann's detailed study of the
                    philosophical, educational, and literary influences of German culture in America easily proves the
                    colonists' awareness of German scholarly and religious thought. Aside from the provocative
                    and complex problem of the influence of Luther and Lutheranism, German cultural influences are more
                    readily apparent in the early libraries, those of individuals as well as that of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which reflected German learning in almost all aspects. The influence of German thought
                    in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is better known, but here also Professor Pochmann assumes
                    nothing and gives a well-authenticated account of the effect of German philosophical thought,
                    educational theories, and literary movements upon the main currents of American culture. The
                    familiar stories of the activities of early scholars like George Ticknor, Edward Everett, and George
                    Bancroft in introducing German ideas and literature; Kantianism and its relation to the development
                    and nature of American transcendentalism; Hegelianism and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Movement; the influences of German thought and writers upon Irving, Longfellow, Poe,
                    Whitman—all take on new color and significance as we read the thorough and interpretative
                    accounts of the transmission of these ideas and forms from one culture to another. Not content to
                    deal merely with the German materials and their American reception, Professor Pochmann has taken
                    great pains to trace the sometimes devious routes of some of the original ideas before they found
                    their way to America often emerging in new forms or different expressions far from the original but
                    still obviously related. A good case in point is the impact of Kant upon American thought mainly
                    through the interpretations, accurate or not, given his philosophy by Coleridge and Carlyle <pb n="448" id="VAA4025-053-4-098"/> in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, and Madame de Stael, Cousin and Jouffroy in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>One cannot fail to be impressed with the immense labor involved in a work of this kind, and happily
                    Professor Pochmann has chosen to go beyond the task of compiling information to interpret and
                    evaluate his material, suggest new approaches, and indicate still undeveloped areas of
                    investigation. While the study is limited to philosophical and literary influences, the portions
                    dealing with the impact of German thought upon American religion and philosophy are the most
                    extensive and interesting for the perspective in which New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> transcendentalism and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Hegelian school are presented. The failure of the Concord School in bringing together
                    permanently the exponents of the two movements is truly an exciting chapter in the history of
                    American philosophy. In this same area, of all the chapters, the one dealing with the development of
                    Emerson's philosophical thought is perhaps one of the most rewarding despite its
                    laboriousness. In tracing Emerson's search for "a unified philosophical religion
                    and a consistent religious philosophy" through its several and complex stages, Professor
                    Pochmann is at his best in showing the subtle and pervasive influence that the study of German
                    thought had both on an individual as well as upon a people who responded to the teachings and
                    writings of that individual.</p>
            <p>The scholarship and thoughtful research that have gone into this work have turned up the need for
                    investigation in numerous unexplored fields. A few examples will indicate the richness of the veins:
                    the progress of science in early New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>; the extent and appraisal of the effect of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> doctrines on colonial American thought; the influence of the theological principles of
                    Herder, Schleiermacher, De Wette, and Strauss upon American theology; a closer study of Denton
                    Snider's system of psychology and its influence.</p>
            <p>In sheer bulk alone this is an impressive book, and the author's handling of such a large
                    and unwieldly body of material is worth noting. The text runs to 492 pages, and the notes, in
                    smaller type, to 307. Into the notes has gone valuable material which while relevant to the content
                    would only have slowed the development of the main theme. The notes deal primarily with textual,
                    critical, and biographical matters, and the reader who ignores them misses some of the liveliest
                    material of the study.</p>
            <pb n="449" id="VAA4025-053-4-099"/>
            <p>In the face of such a prodigious and important work, bringing together as it does so much material
                    from so many sources and much of it new, to criticize may seem to cavil. However, because Professor
                    Pochmann's book is such a useful reference work and will be welcomed by all students of
                    American culture who have already realized the great value of the same author's <hi rend="i">Bibliography of German Culture in America to 1940,</hi> it is unfortunate that there
                    are so many typographical errors to mar an otherwise outstanding book.</p>

                    difficult to entertain. No one can fairly deny his piety, his intellectual energy and adroitness in
                    disputation, the flowing elegance of his prose and the power of his mystical interpretations of
                    natural beauty. These qualities awaken the enthusiasm of many students, who at the same time cannot
                    but deplore his belief that Arminian doctrine is necessarily fatal to a religious life and that
                    accordingly the people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> had during his own lifetime abandoned all genuine piety. The modern reader will be
                    pained by Edwards' inability to comprehend the motives of those who questioned his theology
                    in a spirit of moderation and humanity. Such a spirit might have withheld a more genuinely
                    philosophical theologian from the desperate outbursts by which he undertook to subdue—we
                    might almost say, to demoralize—a recalcitrant congregation. The lurid images of the
                    spiders and the vipers go a long way toward justifying Thomas Paine's sincere belief that
                    there is something profoundly corrupt about a theology that supports such utterances and that in <pb n="450" id="VAA4025-053-4-100"/> the name of common decency we should not expose our children to
                    such indoctrination.</p>
            <p>But these are now ancient quarrels, although the old scars are still visible and there are times when
                    some of us feel the twinge of old wounds. Today the scholarly critic must do his best to avoid the
                    intransigence of the older theologian. Certainly Edwards' treatise on <hi rend="i">Freedom
                        of the Will</hi> has much to offer both the student of the history of ideas and the
                    philosophical reader interested in a well-constructed and comprehensive argument. Most students of
                    American philosophy would, I think, hesitate to place Edwards as a creative and original thinker
                    along with James, Peirce, or Dewey, or, despite his learning and technical proficiency, along with
                    Channing or Theodore Parker in philosophical theology. But it remains true that Edwards'
                    anticipation of Berkeley, his reworking of Locke's psychology, and his exploitation of
                    certain Newtonian concepts constitute a distinguished performance, judged by whatever standards.
                    Edwards deserves a place in the general history of philosophy far more prominent than that which
                    most of the handbooks assign to him.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, it is possible to overrate him and to misinterpret his true position in the history of
                    thought. Perry Miller has insisted in his preface that "At the outset we hope it will be
                    understood that while we approach this towering edifice with veneration, we do not expect to find
                    among all students a unanimity of interpretation, or uncritical endorsement of Edwards'
                    views. He is too majestic a figure to yield to every observer a single, simple meaning, and was too
                    rigorous a critic himself to demand servile adherence."</p>
            <p>But the editors are rather more uncritically enthusiastic than this statement might lead us to
                    suppose. After all, terms like "majestic," quoted above, and
                    "superdreadnaught," employed shortly thereafter, suggest a sentimental allegiance
                    that may help to explain the curiously one-sided comparison, set forth by Mr. Ramsey in his
                    introductory essay, of Edwards' determinism with twentieth century philosophical
                    literature. This interpretation seems to consider Edwards as anticipating much of twentieth century
                    thought. Mr. Ramsey mentions such writers as Bertrand Russell and C. D. Broad but he makes no
                    reference to modern champions of indeterminism such as Boutroux, Bergson, Whitehead, and more <pb n="451" id="VAA4025-053-4-101"/> recently, the Existentialists. When viewed in comparison with
                    the works of these writers, Edwards' theories of causation, of change and of time are
                    obviously "dated" and it becomes clear that he transcends neither the theology of
                    the Reformation nor the pre-Kantian philosophy of the eighteenth century. The efforts made by Miller
                    in his recent book on Edwards and by Ramsey in the present work to present him as philosophically in
                    advance of his period are certainly questionable. Ramsey's study of Edwards'
                    relation to Locke and his theological contemporaries is cogent and enlightening but he quite fails
                    to capture the significance of Edwards' thought for the present day.</p>
            <p>After all, the main thrust of Edwards' argument was theological, and his thinking was
                    overwhelmingly theocentric and reflected a theocratic orientation. Borrowing from Locke's
                    psychology of motivation, Edwards found a way of describing human freedom as consistent with the
                    absolute sovereignty of a Calvinistic deity. To be sure, man may sometimes be free to do as he wills
                    or pleases. But such freedom belongs to the human being as a whole, never to the will itself. Thus
                    there is nothing spontaneous about volition, although there may be a spontaneity of overt action. We
                    may will to act but we do not, according to Edwards, "will to will": we do not
                    initiate our own acts of volition or of decision. As opposed to this, we may argue that we do so
                    often will, or "try our best," to reach a fair or a consistent decision, i.e., we
                    may will to exist as centers of conscious and responsible agency rather than as vehicles of action,
                    wholly propelled by the pressure of such motives as fear, anger, desire, ambition, or religious
                    enthusiasm. Edwards, it seems to me, never made enough of this all-important aspect of our conscious
                    self-control. This is perhaps because he was fascinated by eighteenth century mechanism; but this by
                    itself would have led him into Deism. After all his chief concern was not scientific or
                    philosophical but first and foremost an attempt to "glorify God in man's
                    dependence." Edwards' piety would seem to have been a far stronger motive than his
                    curiosity. This fact is obscured by the rigor and closely-woven pattern of Edwards'
                    argument which has led some critics to think of him as essentially a rationalist. It is true that
                    Edwards possessed extraordinary powers of disputation, but these he subordinated to his convictions,
                    reducing philosophy once <pb n="452" id="VAA4025-053-4-102"/> more to the status of handmaiden. It
                    was primarily in this spirit that he plundered the writings of Newton and Locke. Once we admit this,
                    we may see in Edwards an apologist of rare ability and great eloquence. It is primarily in this
                    light that he should be considered today.</p>

            <p>"Religion like many other things is booming in America; it is a blue chip," writes
                    D. W. Brogan, English observer of the American character, in a recent (February, 1957) issue of <hi rend="i">Harper's Magazine.</hi> This may help to account for the rash of new books and
                    reprints on American Puritanism making appearance on the counters these days.</p>
            <p>More likely it is the realization, as the author of this collection of essays insists, that the mind
                    of man is the basic factor in human history and since the beginnings of American thought lie in the
                    seventeenth century they are, necessarily, theological.</p>
            <p>Together these "pieces", as Miller calls them, are broadly intended to spotlight
                    aspects of the movement of European culture into the vacant wilderness of America; narrowly, to
                    inquire further, as Miller has been doing in a brilliant series of books, into the
                    "errand" that brought the first colonists to America and the meaning of the body
                    of Protestant doctrine we call Puritanism, the first articulate body of expression from which we may
                    begin to derive an understanding of the American mind.</p>
            <p>The ideas of the Puritans, isolated and explained so capably by Perry Miller here and elsewhere
                    cannot, of course, be summarized in a review. The rich intellectual feast spread before us in this
                    slim volume, repetitious and intricate though it is, is added testimony that Miller is one of our
                    best analyzers of thought as it was in a thoughtful age. It must suffice to indicate something of
                    the subjects dealt with under the suggestive titles that make up this collection.</p>
            <p>The first pieces cling closely to problems connected with the nature of Puritanism—why the
                    Puritans went, or were sent, on their errand, and whether the lamentations of the <pb n="453" id="VAA4025-053-4-103"/> later <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> writers indicating the failure of their mission are not really reassuring, carrying a
                    suggestion of the expansion of the errand to include the irresistible and exciting works thrust upon
                    them by the American environment.</p>
            <p>In defending himself against the "curiously sullen reaction" of critics who insist
                    that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>

                    </placeName> orthodoxy.</p>
            <p>Next, in dealing with the "marrow" of <placeName>

                    Calvinism as outlined by Puritans anxious to make their faith easy to be "understood,
                    known, and committed to memory," followed by an analysis of the thorny question of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> political doctrines.</p>
            <p>Another essay argues that the larger assumptions of the promoters and settlers of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> involve religious motivation not dissimilar to that of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, a much needed antidote to the customary interpretation of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> materialism.</p>
            <p>An essay devoted to "Jonathan Edwards and the Great Awakening" takes on special
                    significance, inasmuch as Edwards' works are now being published. Miller sees in the Great
                    Awakening not the old clash of social groups or an economic protest, but indication of a growing
                    awareness that the objectives of America's errand were to be "determined by the
                    wilderness." It was Jonathan Edwards, on the frontier, rather than the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> divines, who saw this challenge of the academic by the practical.</p>
            <p>The author goes on to discuss Edwards as a practitioner of a "Rhetoric of
                    Sensation" derived from Locke, the use of "naked" ideas, in which, among
                    the Puritans, Edwards was an innovator, and with which, as weapons, Edwards whipped up his revival.</p>
            <p>Admitting that in strictly historical regard there is no organic evolution of ideas from Edwards to
                    Emerson, the author, moving beyond Puritanism, suggests, nevertheless, that a tentative exploration
                    shows certain basic continuities—the persistent effort of both men to confront divinity
                    face to face in Nature, and the excitement of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> thought which, Miller thinks, helped provoke the Emersonian rebellion against
                    "corpse-cold" Unitarianism.</p>
            <pb n="454" id="VAA4025-053-4-104"/>
            <p>Less closely related to the theme of the volume, though the author takes pains to make some
                    relations, the last two "pieces" deal with the "American theme"
                    of Nature versus civilization, and the persistent American question, can an errand be run
                    indefinitely?—in other words, the problem, associated with earlier
                    civilizations' eschatology, of the "End of the World." These swirls in
                    the current of American ideas are important contributions to the present broad concern with American
                    civilization, a more general look than the earlier essays at some persistent ideas about the nature
                    of America.</p>
            <p>Though no book for those who are not philosophically inclined and ready to struggle rigorously with
                    the blocks of ideas Miller piles one on the other, the volume has much for the student of ideas,
                    much that is hard, but the reader is amply repaid for his effort by the matchless flashes of clarity
                    that are characteristic of the author. We need more, nevertheless, of the kind of insight that Perry
                    Miller provides if we are to achieve correct perspective on the basic elements that went into the
                    formation of the later <placeName>

            <p>This volume is the published form of a series of lectures delivered at the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in January, 1955, on the Charles R. Walgreen Foundation for the Study of American
                    Institutions. It is the second in a projected series called "The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> History of American Civilization" under the editorship of Daniel J. Boorstin.
                    These studies of American civilization are planned so as to make available both a
                    "chronological" and a "topical" account of American life. The
                    hope is that, in this way, the study and the writing of history may be delivered from the narrative
                    and statistical tedium too often and too long associated with history. The reader is thus to
                    discover "one of the neglected pleasures of history, both as experienced and as
                    written."</p>
            <p>Monsignor Ellis is professor of church history at the Catholic University of America, managing editor
                    of the <hi rend="i">Catholic Historical Review,</hi> and secretary of the American <pb n="455" id="VAA4025-053-4-105"/> Catholic Historical Association. His volume belongs to the
                    "topical" group projected by Professor Boorstin for the purpose of dealing with
                    "varied and important aspects of American life." Among these aspects is
                    "the place of religion" which historical scholarship here recognizes as part of
                    its responsibility and task. Father Ellis' volume is to be followed by similar treatments
                    of American Judaism and American Protestantism.</p>
            <p>The story of American Catholicism could scarcely be more authoritatively and winsomely told. The
                    author's authority stems from his singular competence in the discipline of historical
                    research and from the integrity of his commitment to the Church and the faith about which he writes.
                    The winsomeness of these pages stems from the author's felicity of style and from the kind
                    of mastery of the materials which make felicitous selection and authentic interpretation possible.
                    Here is, in brief compass, the story of Roman Catholicism in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> from the inside, as informed and responsible Roman Catholics see it.</p>
            <p>The theme of the narrative is that Americans have become accustomed to a one-sided view of their
                    origins as a people, owing to a disproportionate attention to Anglo-Saxon colonization of the
                    eastern seaboard. There is another "colonial America," residually evident in place
                    names that stretch from St. Augustine to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This other colonial America is, of course, Spanish and Catholic. And when
                    "Spanish America" is brought into relation with "French
                    America," under the aegis of historical perspective and research, the religious origins of
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> take on a broader and quite different aspect than they have been conventionally wont to
                    assume. Indeed, Catholics came to America from the same predominant motive as that which
                    "had prompted the Puritans to settle in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> and the Quakers in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>." The motive was that they might freely worship God, out of reach of the
                    hampering restrictions of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>'s penal laws. Some ambiguity accompanies Monsignor Ellis' narrative
                    at this point because this answer to the general question, "why did Catholics come to
                    America?," does not cover his earlier account of the Spaniards and the French who appear to
                    have been motivated more by the missionary impulse than by the desire for freedom of <pb n="456" id="VAA4025-053-4-106"/> worship. However this may be, Catholicism was to encounter from the
                    first an ugly and deep-seated "anti-Catholic bias" which overshadows the whole
                    Catholic story in America.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the growth of Catholicism in America has been slow but sure, from "scarcely
                    more than 25,000 Catholics" in 1785 to 33,574,017 in 1956. Plagued by the
                    "anti-Catholic" bias from the outside, this growth represents a triumph also over
                    a difficult problem from within. This was the problem of immigration which during the whole of the
                    nineteenth century, and virtually to the present day, has so absorbed the attention and energies of
                    the Church as to prevent its coming adequately abreast of the intellectual, cultural, and social
                    life of the rest of the nation. This "cultural lag" is now being happily and
                    hopefully overtaken as American Catholicism comes of age, a phenomenon recognized as early as 1908,
                    when Pope Pius X detached the Church in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> from the jurisdiction of the Congregation de Propaganda Fide and recognized its
                    equality with "such ancient churches as those of <placeName>
                  <country reg="it">Italy</country>, <country reg="fr">France</country>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>."</p>
            <p>However, the central paradox of the story of American Catholicism is the one which for a century now
                    has increasingly illuminated the past and troubled the present and future. The paradox is that
                    "the most disliked and suspect of all the American churches was on the way to becoming the
                    largest and strongest single denomination in the land" (p. 81).</p>
            <p>Monsignor Ellis says repeatedly that American Catholics find this paradox difficult to understand.
                    Apparently he finds it difficult to understand also. One can only acknowledge with respect and
                    admiration the irenic and informed sincerity with which he tries to set the record straight as the
                    basis on which the constructive aims and achievements of Catholicism in America may be recognized
                    and accepted. Monsignor Ellis rightly notes that "American Catholics are here to
                    stay" and that if Catholics and their critics would conduct their relations "with
                    more regard for the ancient patristic maxim, <hi rend="i">In necessariis, unitas; in dubiis,
                        libertas; in omnibus, caritas,</hi> it would be a gain for all concerned." It may be
                    hoped, therefore, that a reservation or two about his own attempt to adhere to this maxim, as he
                    tells the story here under review, may not be set down by him or his co-religionists as making
                    "a career out of criticism" but as an indication, in the same spirit, of what
                    makes it difficult <pb n="457" id="VAA4025-053-4-107"/> for some of us who are non-Catholics to be
                    sure that the olive branch is not being extended in a mailed fist.</p>
            <p>On balance, the story here unfolded appears to be not so much history as an <hi rend="i">apologia pro
                        vita catholica.</hi> The two are not necessarily exclusive. But the present narrative does not
                    achieve their happiest correlation. Catholicism, according to these pages, has been the real
                    protagonist of religious toleration in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Catholicism has made the solution of the school question possible by the proposal of a
                    constructive compromise (pp. 109f.). Catholicism, out of regard for the custom of the land, was
                    constructively abolitionist during the Civil War; whereas "Abolitionism" was more
                    often than not fractious and disruptive of social peace. Protestantism is the spearhead of
                    "nativism" which feeds upon and nourishes the anti-Catholic bias in the land. As
                    an historian, Monsignor Ellis is, of course, careful to single out some "Protestant
                    ministers"; but the innuendo involving Protestantism as a whole will not escape the careful
                    reader.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the principal barrier to the Catholic understanding of the anti-Catholic bias is the lack of
                    self-criticism so manifest in these pages. It is as though there were no Reformation lying behind
                    colonial America; no connection at all between Catholicism in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and Catholicism in <placeName>
                  <country reg="sp">Spain</country>, <country reg="it">Italy</country>, <country reg="fr">France</country>
               </placeName>, not to mention Latin
                    America. Does Father Marquette's devotion to the Blessed Virgin really belong in a
                    necessarily highly selective version of the Catholic story? Is this history? Or is it part of the
                    mystique which makes it possible to tell the story of American Catholicism without any reference to
                    Catholicism as a system of power? Irenicism without self-criticism makes for propaganda, not
                    history, not even "committed history."</p>

                    L. Heller. Published under the auspices of the Historical Society of the Indiana Conference, 1957.

            <p>It is no small assignment to undertake the writing of a book about the history of a church
                    conference. This fact becomes especially apparent when one appraises the latest work of Herbert
                    Heller. The author has attempted to present <pb n="458" id="VAA4025-053-4-108"/> a descriptive
                    picture of the significant events that have transpired within the 124-year history of the Indiana
                    Conference of the Methodist Church. Yet he has woven into his picture the political, social, and
                    economic history of Indiana and the nation that had an influence in shaping the history of this
                    Conference. Then, too, Mr. Heller adds to our understanding of this church conference history by
                    relating significant developments and changes that were transpiring within the history of American
                    Methodism. While this book is primarily written as a history of a single conference, it can be
                    interpreted in a broad sense as being a history of Methodism in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The early history of the Conference is graphically told in the oft-quoted diaries of the circuit
                    riders. The hardships and toils of these early ministers is an impressive story, and constitutes the
                    principal content of chapter one. The numerous geographical divisions of the Conference during the
                    period 1836 to 1920, along with a chronological treatment of the significant developments within the
                    Conference, comprise chapter two. Mr. Heller's ability to portray vividly and accurately
                    these geographical changes of the Conference boundaries represents in itself a significant scholarly
                    contribution to Methodist Church history in Indiana. A detailed reporting of the Minutes of the
                    Indiana Conference, which served as a significant source of data for Mr. Heller's study,
                    would have been impossible. In many places the work of specific organizations or churches within the
                    conferences could be given only slight attention. However, in two of the chapters the author
                    attempts to separate the work of specific functions and organizations of the Conference from the
                    general chronological history of the Conference. In these chapters he gives a more detailed
                    description of their origin and development. The specific histories of the camp meetings, historical
                    societies, the Methodist women's organization, the Methodist men's organization,
                    the Methodist youth organizations, the Methodist hospitals, the Methodist children's homes,
                    the Methodist home for the aged, as well as the Goodwill Industries and Fletcher Place Community
                    Center are discussed.</p>
            <p>The author includes in his study a history of the Methodist educational institutions that existed
                    within the Conference boundaries. While the histories of these institutions are brief, they are
                    based on the few primary sources of data that are <pb n="459" id="VAA4025-053-4-109"/> known to
                    exist. Such descriptions provide an interesting picture of southern Indiana secondary and collegiate
                    educational history from the period 1850 to 1875. The schools that existed in this area were <placeName>

                    </placeName> College, and DePauw University.</p>
            <p>In addition to providing a history of the Conference, the author has attempted to present valuable
                    information in the form of statistics and itemized listings concerning numerous topics relative to
                    the history of the Conference. There is a statistical table giving a chronological record of church
                    membership in the Conference from 1832 to 1956. There is also a record of the dates of the districts
                    and circuits of the Conference from 1800 to 1831. Another table furnishes information concerning the
                    number of churches formed in the present day districts during the past thirty-one years. There are
                    also tables listing the names of ministers who have served as members of the Conference, as
                    presiding elders and district superintendents of the Conference, as well as delegates to the General
                    Conferences of the Methodist Church.</p>
            <p>The history of the Indiana Conference is an impressive one. As Mr. Heller says, "The story
                    of the Indiana Conference reveals with clarity the stand of the Church in Indiana against every form
                    of evil and human weakness, from its earliest days to the present. This historical fact is the
                    greatness of the Church. In this, the Methodists have justification for great pride and
                    satisfaction."</p>
            <p>At times there appears an overemphasis of the political and social history of the state as well as
                    the history of American Methodism. This often results in minimizing the major purpose of the book
                    which was the Conference history.</p>
            <p>The book draws to an abrupt conclusion without making any attempt to tie together many of the
                    significant developments of the Conference history. Since so many tangents seemed necessary to the
                    author, it might have been desirable for him to provide a summary chapter highlighting the major
                    contributions of this Conference. But while such a chapter might have been an improvement, its
                    omission does not seriously detract from the general value.</p>

            <p>In his preface Professor Meyer asserts: "There was a time when educational history was a
                    highly regarded subject—when, in fact, it was almost mandatory for every student teacher
                    to study it. That heyday has long since gone by." Though this quotation suggests a very
                    desirable emphasis for teachers generally, it unfortunately indicates a Golden Age of educational
                    history which had about as much literal existence as Noah's Ark or the Garden of Eden.</p>
            <p>Doubtless, however, most historians will readily concur in Meyer's further observation:
                    "Open almost any teachers' college catalogue, and you will find at once lists of
                    courses in administrative supervision, in methods of teaching this or that, in guidance and
                    personnel, in the lower, secondary, and higher learning, and so on to Catering I, Church Work II,
                    and Body Building VI (with laboratory, 3 pts.). By the same token you will find educational history
                    in a state of comparative desuetude, and commonly as an elective." Professor Meyer, himself
                    a professor of Education, also criticizes "the historical brethren" as bearing
                    much responsibility for the existing low status of educational history.</p>
            <p>Meyer examines "the great landmarks of American educational history" (p. ix) from
                    the colonial era to the 1950's. He makes clear the European impact on, the privileged
                    nature of, and religious domination over education in colonial times. The nineteenth century
                    modified or departed from various colonial patterns and practices in education, but the
                    secularization of education for youth generally developed slowly and unevenly. Since the late
                    nineteenth century, however, the expansion and secularization of education have made substantial
                    strides. Meanwhile, in this period professional schools and graduate study, as well as extension and
                    adult education movements, have grown rapidly.</p>
            <p>Mr. Eddy, vice-president and provost of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName>, the land-grant institution for that state, has produced a semi-official and
                    sympathetic centennial history <pb n="461" id="VAA4025-053-4-111"/> of the land-grant college
                    movement. Though seemingly not as well informed about the main threads and principal currents of
                    American history as Meyer, Eddy is keenly aware that the land-grant colleges are deeply rooted in
                    American experience. He is, however, fuzzy and inconsistent about the European impact on them.</p>
            <p>According to Eddy the land-grant colleges represented a revolt against the traditional liberal arts
                    colleges. In fact, they began principally as trade schools for farmers and artisans. Moreover, in
                    the early days most students gave some time to farming or a trade while in attendance at the infant
                    colleges. Federal aid, though of less relative importance in recent than in former decades, has been
                    a basic factor in the growth of these colleges, a number of which are now aggressive rivals with
                    state universities for support and leadership in higher education. The actual differences between
                    them and the state universities are less than formerly, though Eddy probably exaggerates the
                    attachment of the land-grant institutions to liberal education.</p>
            <p>Teaching, research, and extension have been the three arms of the educational programs of the
                    land-grant colleges. Their success in agricultural extension has been especially notable. More than
                    half of them serve as a part of state universities, but approximately twenty operate as separate
                    institutions. In addition, about seventeen states, all located in the South or on its perimeter,
                    have land-grant colleges attended exclusively or largely by Negroes. Thus several southern states
                    have a state university and two land-grant colleges. Thus, in various states, especially in the
                    South and West, separate land-grant colleges have resulted in an unwise decentralization of state
                    support of higher education.</p>
            <p>Although both authors err now and then regarding particular facts or conclusions, these volumes are
                    comprehensive, readable, and worthwhile accounts. They are written in a broad context for a broad
                    audience. Fortunately their authors eschew the jargon and nomenclature, so common in educational
                    circles, and both normally summarize or interpret educational theories and practices into familiar
                    ideas and concepts. Meyer and Eddy are generous concerning the scope of education, but both are
                    fearful and wary about the dangers of perverting educational programs to achieve
                    "desirable" political or social changes.</p>

            <p>Immigration fanned the kindled coals of freedom and aided in the establishment of American newspapers
                    in foreign languages. The immigrant could more readily become acclimated to his new and strange

            <p>Although Benjamin Franklin published the first German newspaper, the <hi rend="i">Philadelphische
                        Zeitung,</hi> on May 6, 1732, the German-language press did not take root until Christopher
                    Saur, an immigrant from the Palatinate, issued his paper in 1739. As the number of immigrants
                    increased more German papers were issued, some meeting their demise within a relatively short time
                    while others were more successful. The last twenty-five years of the nineteenth century may be
                    referred to as the era of prosperity for many German-language papers. In 1885, 75 per cent of all
                    foreign language papers in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    1893–1894 when nearly eight hundred German publications were issued. In 1895 the number
                    declined to 714, in 1900 to 613, and in 1956 to about 24, only four of which were dailies—<placeName>

            <p>In a Presidential campaign speech delivered at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> on September 19, 1912, Woodrow Wilson reminded himself and his audience of the
                    impossibility of escape from history: "I think of that quiet jury sitting in those rooms
                    surrounded by nothing but shelves and books and documents. I think of the anticipated verdict of
                    another generation" (p. 212). Here in these very different volumes are two of the ways in
                    which historians contribute towards that anticipated verdict. In the one, Wilson's own
                    words are the weights placed carefully onto the historian's balance; in the other it is the
                    matured judgments of a historian himself that are laid upon the scales. How far both of these
                    incline the pointer towards greatness is for posterity to decide.</p>
            <p>Mr. Davidson's meticulous edition of the recovered texts of Wilson's 1912 campaign
                    speeches represents the editor's craft at its best. His prefatory settings for each speech
                    are not only informative but entertaining, fitting introductions to speeches which are still
                    surprisingly alive—something that is explained not only by the breadth of
                    Wilson's mind, but also by his habit of speaking extemporaneously. In these
                    speeches—from that of August 7 accepting the nomination, to the touching impromptu by
                    torchlight delivered to the massed <pb n="464" id="VAA4025-053-4-114"/> Princetonians on the news of
                    victory—we have one of the most exciting accounts in print of one of America's
                    most exciting campaigns.</p>
            <p>Whether the picture revealed by the "lost texts" of these speeches will require
                    historians to readjust the views they now hold about the campaign—for as Charles Seymour
                    points out in his introduction to this book: "With a single exception, his speeches were
                    delivered extemporaneously, and the impression they produced is often quite different from that of
                    the advance copies given to the press, and far more compelling" (p. xii)—time
                    alone will tell. Mr. Davidson believes that at any rate these texts should correct a tendency to
                    overemphasize the economic aspects of Wilson's views at the expense of his concern for
                    social justice, as well as clarify his concept of the federal government's role, a concept
                    that laid far less stress upon the idea of <hi rend="i">laissez-faire</hi> than often is assumed.</p>
            <p>In any event, here, expressed in Wilson's own vigorously eloquent language, is revealed the
                    maturing of what Richard Hofstadter has called the "Conservative as Liberal."</p>
            <p>Mr. Link's volume is representative of an interesting characteristic of American historical
                    writing today—the large place given to substantial biographical studies. Nor do these
                    biographer-historians lack for readers. For some time now biography has outsold all other categories
                    of books save fiction. The public interest in biography does not, however, completely explain its
                    present historiographical importance. While it is true that historians, like all writers, want to be
                    read, it is also true that, like all scholars, they want to be significant. Once upon a time to be a
                    significant historian meant to produce history in the grand manner—to seek out some lofty
                    Everest from whose summit one could, like Parkman or Gibbon, gaze out over a whole world of human
                    affairs. Today, however, history-writing in the grand manner, when viewed in terms of the rigorous
                    demands of modern scholarship and the dimensions of what Allan Nevins has called the
                    "mighty torrent of evidence," presents almost insuperable difficulties. The
                    alternative—specialization, expressing itself through the monograph—has failed
                    to appeal to many historians who still yearn for the satisfactions of a subject possessing breadth
                    as well as depth. To many of these scholars the large scale biography has offered a means of
                    escaping from the confines <pb n="465" id="VAA4025-053-4-115"/> of the monograph while at the same
                    time avoiding the pitfalls of the grand manner.</p>
            <p>The writing of biography, however, poses a basic problem. Should the work be what Sir Edmund Goss
                    defined as biography—"the faithful portrait of a soul in its adventures through
                    life"—which implies a close psychological study; or should it forsake the minute
                    analysis of the subject as a personality for a broader study as a personage—which leads
                    to the "life-and-times" biography. This is a matter that can long be debated.
                    Suffice it to say that most American biographer-historians, including Mr. Link in his present study,
                    have chosen the life-and-times approach.</p>
            <p>Mr. Link's book is the second of a projected multi-volume biography of Wilson. The emphases
                    are upon "the major stages in Wilson's own personal and political growth and the
                    development of his most important domestic and foreign policies from November 1912 to November
                    1914" (p. vii). The book has three main parts: the first concerns itself with
                    Wilson's first months as President, and is essentially the story of the building of an
                    administration, with all the interplay of personality and politics that underlie the complicated and
                    often obscure maneuverings always associated with such a crucial undertaking; the second deals with
                    the intra- and inter-party battles fought around the great Wilson reforms—tariff,
                    monetary, business—that were the major objectives of the New Freedom; the third has to do
                    with the formulation of foreign policy, with Latin America, especially Mexico, receiving the most
                    attention. A final chapter rounds out the book, focusing on the unfortunate Jones-Warburg
                    controversy, the national impact of the ferocious <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cou">Colorado</region>
                    </placeName> coal fields strike, and the unhappy results for the Democrats of the Congressional
                    elections of 1914.</p>
            <p>A book of this scope produces opportunity for many a scholarly debate. This reviewer is not a
                    specialist in either Wilson or his period, and hence is not equipped to enter any such debate on
                    either fact or interpretation. However, there are one or two minor points upon which questions might
                    be asked. The author, it appears to this reviewer, makes an excessively reductive statement when he
                    says that Colonel House, on the occasion of his 1914 trip to Europe, "might conceivably
                    have saved the peace of the world, to the eternal credit of New Freedom diplomacy, if it had come a
                    year before instead upon <pb n="466" id="VAA4025-053-4-116"/> the eve of Armageddon" (p.
                    318). There is also what seems to be a contradiction of sorts in some basic remarks regarding the
                    general nature of Wilson's Latin American policy. On page 328 the author says,
                    "The most important cause of the disparity between Wilsonian promise and practice was the
                    fact that New Freedom diplomacy was inadequate to insure the security of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the western hemisphere." However, on page 330 he says the security factor
                    "only partially explains the disparity … . for security considerations actually
                    played a secondary role in the Wilson administration's most ambitious projects of
                    intervention and control." Such criticism, however, by its very paucity underscores the
                    generally high standard of scholarship that characterizes the book. At this date Mr. Link's
                    volume must stand as the most solidly researched and up-to-date survey of Wilson's first
                    two years as President.</p>
            <p>However, to this reviewer it is somewhat less satisfactory as biography. The main setting of the book
                    is Congress and the executive departments; the chief action is the implementation of the ideals of
                    the New Freedom into public policy. To this setting, and in terms of this theme, the President
                    regularly descends to succor his hard-pressed Myrmidons at some juncture; and, the crisis past, as
                    regularly ascends to the aloofness of the White House. Actions are explained, details clearly given,
                    confusions and complexities disentangled, but somehow through it all Wilson remains rather
                    unilluminated in terms of the inner man. This is an almost unavoidable result of the life-and-times
                    approach to biography: the times tend to swallow up the man. Perhaps this is the consequence of
                    viewing the subject via a method primarily descriptive rather than analytic, that emphasizes
                    externalities rather than the inner man, that is obliged to mass the facts of public life at the
                    expense of exhaustively probing private relationships. Throughout <hi rend="i">The New Freedom</hi>
                    there are many instances of cogent considerations of character and personality; but it is
                    essentially a political history organized in terms of chapters which are primarily monographic-like
                    studies of major episodes in a Presidential administration, and only secondarily biographical
                    considerations of the places of these episodes in the life of Wilson.</p>
            <p>The insidious tendency of the monographic approach to insert itself in this type of biography has
                    also, at least to this <pb n="467" id="VAA4025-053-4-117"/> reviewer, affected the literary aspects
                    of the book. Mr. Link's narrative treatment makes for clear exposition at the expense of
                    dramatic appeal; his style, while lucid, is a plain one with little or no use of metaphor, which
                    advances in a sober, steady cadence. This kind of writing makes for easy reading and quick
                    understanding, but also, in an extended work, it can skirt dangerously close to dryness. There is
                    also present in the writing an undue dependence upon overworked expressions; fewer appearances in
                    the future volumes of falls from grace, pressing concerns, wraths that are aroused, and devotions
                    that are dog-like will make for more effective prose.</p>
            <p>In summary, one can say, on the basis of Mr. Link's first two volumes, that here is the
                    Wilson biography of our times. While it has its shortcomings—as what scholarly work of
                    such scope does not?—as an example of good, solid historical writing it testifies
                    impressively to the author's diligence, seriousness of purpose, and technical skill. It is
                    a good example of the learned life-and-time biography so frequently produced today by American
                    historians.</p>

                    </placeName> entered the first World War in 1917. The lynchings, the strong-arm police methods, the
                    hysterical trials, the grossly unfair sentencing by such judges as the late Kenesaw Mountain
                    Landis—all this is here in detail. There also is description of the less violent measures
                    taken against Americans who were lukewarm to the war effort. Individuals who did not wish to buy
                    Liberty Bonds found their doorsteps painted yellow. German-Americans and other former nationals of
                    the enemy countries in 1917–1918 sometimes had to demonstrate their loyalty to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> by publicly kissing the American flag.</p>
            <p>The reason why Americans during the first World War behaved so shamefully toward objectors to the war
                    was not simply wartime fears. The unconstitutional repressions of <pb n="468" id="VAA4025-053-4-118"/> civil rights during the war had a number of motives. Destruction of the I.W.W., for example,
                    involved a great deal of anti-labor and anti-Socialist feeling; where patriotism ended and other
                    hatreds began was difficult to say. Likewise many violations of civil liberties during the war years
                    showed racial feeling, for opponents to war often were former citizens of East European countries
                    with traditions different from those commonly denominated "American." Dislike of
                    foreign ways easily led to persecution under the excuse of patriotism. The authors of <hi rend="i">Opponents of War</hi> have moved carefully in describing the reasons for intolerance at home in
                    1917–1918. As a piece of social analysis the book is subtle and convincing.</p>
            <p>It is perhaps unfair therefore to criticize it for what it has not attempted to do, and yet one
                    cannot help remarking that despite its excellence the volume fails to attain any kind of broad
                    perspective. Professor Fite, who carried the work to completion after the death in 1952 of his
                    colleague Professor Peterson, has expressly disclaimed any broad approach.
                    "Generally," he writes, "the treatment has been more descriptive than
                    analytical, although a considerable amount of analysis has been included." The above
                    sentence is revealing in more ways than one, for its passive-voice verbs reflect the book's
                    colorless writing. But does not its point, that <hi rend="i">Opponents of War</hi> is descriptive
                    and not analytical, sound suspiciously like the procedure so common to doctoral dissertations, where
                    the inexperienced student refuses to generalize and takes refuge in a recital of facts?</p>
            <p>To ask such a question is not to belittle the research of Professors Peterson and Fite. Still,
                    printing costs being what they are today, and with the reading public usually balking at the
                    purchase of university press books, should not professorial writers attempt to get away from the
                    narrow, narrative approach, and tell their readers what their subjects mean for the broad course of
                    history? <hi rend="i">Opponents of War</hi> does make feeble efforts in that direction in the last
                    chapter. But why not write a book that constantly puts its facts into the main stream of American
                    history? Why not show that the sorry tampering with civil rights in 1917–1918 was part of
                    a long history of unconstitutional acts during wartime or supposed periods of national danger? Why
                    not, indeed, bring the sorry present into the sorry past? The book under <pb n="469" id="VAA4025-053-4-119"/> review does all these things inadequately, and the result is a volume
                    of only narrow excellence—a painstakingly factual, extremely well researched,
                    disappointingly myopic account of an important episode in American history.</p>

               <hi rend="i">British Emigration to North America: Projects and Opinions in the Early Victorian
                        Period.</hi> By Wilbur S. Shepperson. (<placeName>

            <p>Although the subtitle of this book would limit its scope to the middle half of the past century, the
                    author has given a rather lengthy introduction to earlier phases of British emigration, and
                    concludes with an excellent chapter in which he evaluates emigration as a practical movement and as
                    a theoretical issue. This is the best part of the book.</p>
            <p>The volume deals with certain phases of immigration and the settlement of Britons in the colonies and
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, but it is devoted primarily to emigration and the unusual importance which it assumed
                    from the late Georgian through the early Victorian periods. During the nineteenth century almost
                    seventeen million persons emigrated from the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-uk">United Kingdom</country>
                    </placeName>; approximately 80 per cent of them went to North America. The views of the British
                    people as well as the government attitude on the controversial subject of emigration are discussed
                    at considerable length.</p>
            <p>According to the author, one of the objects of the work was to illustrate the place emigration
                    occupied in the minds of the people. While it is primarily a narrative of events, it is also devoted
                    to the development of ideas. Attempt is made at interpretation and explanation, but the major space
                    is given over to a recording of information.</p>
            <p>The first part of the book gives an account of the emigration movement as approached by farmers,
                    agricultural workers, and the landed aristocracy; labor unions, Chartists, and unorganized
                    industrial workers; philanthropic agencies, self-help societies, and religious bodies. The second
                    part deals with the reaction to the emigration movement, and depicts the views of commercial men,
                    financiers, and industrialists on the subject of the exodus of laborers and skilled workers. <pb n="470" id="VAA4025-053-4-120"/> Much attention is given to governmental reaction to emigration
                    as the movement impinged on domestic, colonial, and foreign issues.</p>
            <p>The author has collected and assimilated a tremendous amount of factual data on the subject.
                    Voluminous footnote references appear at the end of each of the seven chapters, as well as an
                    excellent summation. The bibliography of 27 pages lists the references used, mostly from the British
                    Museum, although the Public Records Office and other English libraries were used extensively.</p>
            <p>The frontispiece carries a painting by the pre-Raphaelite artist, Ford Madox Brown, in which he
                    portrays his impressions of a young couple seeing their homeland for the last time. It is entitled

                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>

                    more to the research student than to the average reader.</p>

            <p>This biography reviews the life of a pioneer business editor who was one of the first Americans
                    systematically to collect and publish reliable business information. Born in 1812 in a frontier
                    village in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName>, Henry Varnum Poor had a long and varied career as lawyer, railroad promoter,
                    cartographer, reformer, business editor, congressional lobbyist, and finally publisher of the <hi rend="i">Manual of the Railroads of the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName>.</hi> But this book properly concentrates on Poor's work as editor of the
                        <hi rend="i">American Railroad Journal</hi> in the dozen years prior to the Civil War.</p>
            <p>In 1849 when Poor became editor of the important but not too successful <hi rend="i">Journal,</hi>
                    the nation was on the threshold of a decade of significant railroad expansion and development. What
                    had been but a scattering of short lines from <placeName>

                    adequately all the <pb n="471" id="VAA4025-053-4-121"/> states east of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. As the only "big business" then on the American scene, the railroads
                    participated fully in the business prosperity and optimism that appeared with the discovery of gold
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. No other industrial institution did business on so vast a scale, financed itself from
                    such a variety of sources, or employed such numbers of men of varied skills.</p>
            <p>After the young lawyer had given up his modest practice in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName>, and moved to <placeName>

                    </placeName> City to edit the Journal, he found a paper with a subscription list of twelve hundred
                    which had been a major spokesman for the railroad industry for seventeen years. His predecessors had
                    made the publication meet the widely felt need for technical engineering information, with articles
                    upon the building of the permanent way, rolling stock, braking, lubrication, and operating costs.
                    Henry Poor at first continued this emphasis upon the technical content, even adding a department for
                    "mining and metallurgy." But soon he began to stress the collection and analysis
                    of essential financial and operational information. As his paper became more of a financial journal
                    it prospered and by 1854 had a weekly circulation of nearly five thousand. Most of the new readers
                    were railroad managers or investors. The new prosperity permitted Poor and his family to afford a
                    substantial home, several servants, summer vacations away from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, and private schooling for the children.</p>
            <p>Over half the chapters of Alfred Chandler's book trace the shifting editorial policies of
                    the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> as they reflected the needs of the railroad industry and also the
                    general business or financial climate. From the fall of 1850 until December, 1852, Poor considered
                    that the primary function of his paper was to represent the railroads on Wall Street. In his desire
                    to encourage railroad construction in the West in the early 1850's, Henry Poor found a
                    staunch ally in James F. D. Lanier, an Indiana banker who had recently founded his own banking house
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> City. Lanier was one of the first bankers in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> with confidence in western railroads. As the rail construction boom picked up speed in
                    the early 1850's, Poor shifted his editorials to a plea for restraint. In 1853 and 1854 he
                    stressed the need for retrenchment and warned against the dangers of overconstruction. <pb n="472" id="VAA4025-053-4-122"/> From 1854 until the depression following the crisis of 1857 Henry Poor
                    emphasized the need for financial reform in the industry. After 1857 his editorials continued to
                    deal with the varied problems of railroad management. Long before his retirement from the editorship
                    in 1861, Henry Varnum Poor had become a major spokesman for the railroads of America.</p>
            <p>Two final chapters describe Poor's career after he left the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> for a
                    variety of projects in railroad and government finance. His major undertaking began in 1867 when his
                    son William suggested that his father publish and edit a <hi rend="i">Manual of the Railroads of the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName>.</hi> Published annually after 1868, the Manual was an immediate success and had a
                    monopoly of the field until 1900. Much of the success was due to the willingness of the railroad
                    officials to give Poor the information he requested each spring. They trusted Poor and also were
                    aware that they could hardly afford the bad publicity of refusal. The statistics which Poor
                    collected remain the single most useful source of information available on the railroads of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> prior to the statistical studies of the Interstate Commerce Commission starting in
                    1888.</p>
            <p>Written by a great-grandson of Henry Poor, this study is of greatest value for its thorough and
                    painstaking survey of the growing pains and financial problems of American railroads in their decade
                    of rapid growth prior to the Civil War. Mr. Chandler describes with a sure touch several new facets
                    of the business life of the decade. Especially interesting is his description of the shifting
                    financial leadership of eastern cities in the mid-nineteenth century. A single map clearly indicates
                    the extensive rail expansion in the period 1849–1854. This volume is based largely upon
                    the several collections of Poor papers, his numerous writings, and of course appropriate volumes of
                    the <hi rend="i">American Railroad Journal.</hi> The book is fully documented, with the notes,
                    unfortunately, in the back of the volume. Mr. Chandler has given us an illuminating biography of a
                    pioneer American business editor and analyst.</p>

            <p>The settlement of the West has been a peculiarly important factor in American history, and the
                    opening of the Old Northwest was a significant part of this movement. Professor Havighurst has
                    proposed the story of the latter as his goal for this volume in the "American
                    Procession" series. The book's subtitle refers to the "first"
                    land rush; the setting is primarily that area which is now <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, although references are made to territories beyond.</p>
            <p>The general outline of the opening of the Old Northwest is faithfully reproduced in the book. Indian
                    claims were acquired and other native claimants pacified or weakened. The mechanics of federal land
                    policy were put into operation. The ever-present squatter did not wait for land legislation and such
                    legislation did not immediately meet the needs of the immigrant. Consequently the Land Act of 1800
                    was passed and settlement increased. Pioneers crossed the Alleghenies and descended the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River, eventually creating a new western society. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> settlements from Gallipolis and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName> Reserve to North Bend are discussed; cultural aspects are sampled and evidences of
                    growth of this part of the Old Northwest are noted.</p>
            <p>The treatment of the material is literary and episodic rather than empirical. The book is divided
                    into five parts entitled "Twilight of the Tribes," "Tomahawk Rights and
                    Land Warrants," " `What Part of the World Do You Come From?',"
                    "Cabin in the Clearing," and "Once a Wilderness." Its content is
                    noticeably popular in style. Mr. Havighurst relies heavily on biographical sketches, some of which
                    are pertinent, some spread throughout the book (William Henry Harrison was at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Greene</region>
                    </placeName> Ville on page 6 and was buried on the next to last page), while others are unduly
                    emphasized. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> figures from Platt Benedict to Zalmon Wildman are presented; yet such men as Winthrop
                    Sargent, Francis Menard, Jonathan Jennings, Jesse B. Thomas, and many others have been omitted.
                    Similarly some episodes are described in detail while others are barely mentioned or are omitted.
                    Such matters as the Gallipolis settlement, the Burr-Blennerhassett intrigue, Johnny Appleseed, and
                    "Mad Ann" Bailey are unduly <pb n="474" id="VAA4025-053-4-124"/> emphasized; the
                    contributions of Albert Gallatin and Jared Mansfield, the weaknesses of the credit system, and
                    midwestern states other than <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> are slighted.</p>
            <p>The book shows signs of acknowledging too casually the details of midwestern history. Is the author
                    aware of the colonial precedents to our federal land system? Much of his description of this phase
                    is anchored in long quotations from the works of Silas Deane and Pelatiah Webster rather than at
                    least a mention of the ideas of Amelia Ford, Clarence Alvord, and Lawrence Gipson. Sections
                    concerning the Confederation period show confusion as to whether Merrill Jensen's works
                    were accepted or rejected by Mr. Havighurst. Little effort is made to assess the role of Alexander
                    Hamilton in the formulation of the federal land program. The author is too often inaccurate in the
                    citation of specific facts. He has persisted in noting that Indiana became a state in 1817. He

            <p>About five years ago the Institute of Early American History and Culture began a series of
                    conferences in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Williamsburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> to consider possibilities of research into relatively little explored fields and to
                    encourage investigation into areas which need a critical re-examination. This volume, the second in
                    the Institute's "Needs and Opportunities for Study" series, is a result
                    of a conference in 1953 which was devoted <pb n="475" id="VAA4025-053-4-125"/> to early American
                    Indian and white relations. It is composed of an essay and an extended bibliography.</p>
            <p>The basis of discussion for this seminar was a paper by William N. Fenton. Revised, it is now
                    presented as "Indian and White Relations in Eastern North America: A Common Ground for
                    History and Ethnology." The essay is concerned with the problem of charting the twilight
                    zone between the two disciplines by definition and suggestion. Beyond a few suggestions which he
                    labels as "an agenda for mutual assistance," <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fenton</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s appeal for an ethnohistorical approach is primarily bibliographical in
                    nature. Under the titles of "Indian ethnography for historians," "the
                    literature of the council fire," "upstreaming, the method of
                    ethnohistory," and "condolence and calumet, the drama of forest
                    diplomacy," the author weaves his ideas into a bibliographical essay or commentary which
                    serves as a helpful introduction to the formal bibliography which follows.</p>
            <p>More than two-thirds of this volume is the collaborative bibliography prepared by Lyman H.
                    Butterfield, Wilcomb E. Washburn, and Fenton. It is annotated and presented under the following
                    headings: reference and bibliographical aids, ethnological literature, historical literature,
                    serials, manuscript sources, documentary publications, and special topics. The last is subdivided
                    into portraiture, literature, songs, art, biography and autobiography, captivities, missions and
                    education, government policy, and the Indian in literature and thought. The most valuable
                    contribution is the thirteen-page section on manuscript sources which is broken down by geographic
                    areas. Aside from the over 1700 entry volume, <hi rend="i">An Essay Towards an Indian
                    Bibliography,</hi> by Thomas W. Field, there is nothing that approaches an adequate bibliography on
                    this general subject. The literature is vast indeed and it would require a shelf full of books like
                    Field to list it all. The purpose of the present work is to be selective and suggestive. Within
                    these defined limits, Butterfield, Washburn, and Fenton have done a commendable job of providing
                    "for the student of history … a guide to important ethnological
                    literature," and "for the student of ethnology … a guide to important
                    historical literature."</p>
            <p>Some important developments of a pioneering nature have occurred in the last few years that are
                    defining and publicizing ethnohistory as a field of research and study. <pb n="476" id="VAA4025-053-4-126"/> Among these are the Newberry Library Conference on Indian Studies and

                    Governor's Circle because the Governor's Mansion was to be erected there. A large,
                    square, two story, yellow brick building surrounded by a rail fence was the Governor's
                    Mansion, but in name only, for no governor ever lived there.</p>
            <p>One chapter, "Round and Round the Circle to 1870," includes a plat and descriptions
                    of many of the early buildings. Among these were residences of early citizens, five churches, three
                    schools, two newspapers, a fire station, and a livery stable. Another chapter is devoted to the
                    Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument which was erected to honor the heroes of the Civil
                    War and which is described as the heart of the Circle as well as the trademark of <placeName>

            <p>American economic history has been greatly advanced in the last half dozen years by the willingness
                    of certain oil companies to open their records and have their histories written. Notable among these
                    are the first volume of the Standard Oil (<placeName>

                    </placeName>) history by the Hidys and the more recent history of Standard Oil (Indiana) by Paul H.
                    Giddens. The volume of Kendall Beaton on the Shell Oil Company and its predecessors may not be quite
                    of the same class, but it is well written, carefully done, and full of information, although it is
                    sometimes bogged down with detail which, for the general reader, could be skipped without loss.</p>
            <p>The Shell operations in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> have certain elements of interest different from those of the domestic companies. Not
                    only is Shell Oil the only foreign oil company operating extensively in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, but doubtless it is the largest foreign industrial interest in this country. By 1951
                    it was the sixth largest oil company in sales and by 1954 had assets of over a billion dollars.
                    Always dominated by an unusually able group of Dutch-British financiers and oil men who headed the
                    Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch-Shell group companies), it nevertheless employed many
                    American executives in its subsidiaries here, financed these companies in part with American money,
                    and opened one-third of the stock of Shell Oil to purchase on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> stock market.</p>
            <p>The Royal Dutch Petroleum Company has one of the most complicated structures in business history.
                    Both it and the Shell Transport and Trading Company (British) had for years attempted to exploit oil
                    in the Far East. There the market had been dominated by Standard Oil, and to meet <pb n="478" id="VAA4025-053-4-128"/> this competition these two companies and the Rothschilds combined in
                    1902. Shell Transport and Trading Company began to buy American oil in 1901 and in 1912 the Royal
                    Dutch-Shell group entered <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> as a competitor to the local companies.</p>
            <p>Between 1912 and 1920 Shell moved from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> into the Middle West and in the 1920's into the eastern seaboard. During the
                    twenties expansion was rapid and by the end of the decade it operated in every state of the union.
                    The period of the thirties was a different story; it was one of retreat, consolidation, and
                    retirement from marketing in most of the area between the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> and the Rockies. As a result of the war, business was good in the forties and Shell did
                    notable work in its technical and scientific research. In the fifties Shell enjoyed a new era of
                    expansion and prosperity.</p>
            <p>Entering a country already well supplied with numerous oil companies, always faced by bitter
                    competition, and sometimes opposition because of its foreign background, the Shell group in
                    forty-five years has risen to an important position. Mr. Beaton has told the story in great detail;
                    the text runs to almost seven hundred pages. His account is a straight and apparently accurate
                    record; it tells of failures and mistakes as well as successes, and is often enriched by the
                    reminiscences of small as well as important executives. While he covers virtually all phases of
                    Shell's history in America, the reviewer was particularly impressed by the clear and
                    detailed account of the technical and scientific contributions made by what is now called the Shell
                    Oil Company.</p>

            <p>This centennial volume on the National Education Association is largely a topical review of its part
                    in the educational movements of the past century. The work is a stimulating commentary not only on
                    the elevation of teaching to the status of a profession but also on the rise of the high schools;
                    the development of normal schools, teachers' colleges, and other elements of higher
                    education; successive currents of thought on the purposes and methods of education in the <pb n="479" id="VAA4025-053-4-129"/> lower schools; and much else, including the supply of the tools
                    of education as a business. This is a mine of information about an extremely intricate feature of
                    American life; it is also a guide through much of the confusion which conies with intricacy.</p>
            <p>Occasionally, however, the book fails to do full justice to the complexity of the subject at hand,
                    e.g. the work of the Committee of Ten on the high school curriculum. But the appearance of one-sided
                    judgments is less disconcerting than the author's deliberate omission of a narrative
                    account of the inward life of the NEA as distinct from its outward activity. By focusing on
                    movements in which the NEA participated, the book succeeds completely in reminding the reader that
                    educational institutions do not live in a vacuum but comes perilously close to being Hamlet without
                    the soliloquies. The NEA <hi rend="i">Proceedings</hi> were, the author remarks, his most important
                    single source: what do unpublished papers have to offer? Something is actually said about the inner
                    story of the NEA—enough to suggest that its public role cannot be understood without full
                    knowledge of its private life, enough to call simplistic judgments upon the NEA into serious
                    question, but not enough to give more than glimpses of the NEA as a product of its history as an
                    association of mortal beings. The historical study of American education can suffer as truly, if not
                    as seriously, from a violent reaction against parochialism as from that preoccupation with
                    intramural trivialities which the author obviously sought to avoid. His intention is praiseworthy,
                    the result disappointing.</p>

                    non-technical language that any high school student or adult can understand" (p. viii). It
                    is his belief that the work will be helpful "as a supplemental text or reference reading
                    for introductory business courses, economic history, industrial history, and courses dealing with
                    business organization and business ethics, business leaders and business leadership" (p.
                    ix) as well as to the general reader and to anyone engaged in business.</p>
            <p>The sources used in the preparation of these sketches have been published books, articles, and
                    newspapers, recent and contemporary, but manuscript materials such as the personal or business
                    papers of the men concerned were not included. Each sketch is offered in a chronological narrative,
                    and woven into each narrative is an assessment of the contribution of each man to business and
                    economic development.</p>
