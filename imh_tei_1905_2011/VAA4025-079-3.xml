            <p>Almost from its earliest days the automobile has been an object of both special American affection
                    and controversy.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Profoundly affecting nearly all segments of society and
                    changing lifestyles in so many ways, the system that combined private cars and public roads has
                    raised important and still unresolved questions. Are private cars preferable to other forms of
                    transportation, such as railroads and streetcars? If Americans are to rely on cars rather than mass
                    transit, are the cars properly designed and built? What kinds of governmental policies can best
                    protect the public interest? These are no idle questions, especially for automakers.</p>
            <p>During the early twentieth century, mounting traffic congestion and accidents led local and state
                    governments to act. In addition to considering the kinds of streets and highways that could
                    accommodate the automobile, governments imposed maximum speed limits and other restrictions aimed at
                    improving traffic safety. At the same time, some critics charged that manufacturers were responsible
                    for the accident toll because they produced unsafe cars. Automakers feared that such talk would
                    cause consumer resistance and harmful governmental interference. Nevertheless, until the depression
                    of the 1930s, car ownership within the <placeName>

                    the automotive industry.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the advent of the Great Depression, however, the industry faced renewed threats. Economic
                    failure lowered the reputation of business and made Americans more willing to scrutinize their
                    economic system. Some critics charged that the oligopolistic nature of the automotive industry, with
                    its lack of meaningful competition, produced among manufacturers similar policies regarding car
                    designs and prices. Others blamed the presence of competition for irrational marketing policies,
                    including annual model changes.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The emerging consumer movement, while largely
                    ignoring the broadest political and philosophical issues, focused critical perspective on the cars
                    themselves. Evaluating car designs, prices, and operating costs, consumer advocates asked why
                    America did not have safer, cheaper, and more fuel efficient cars.</p>
            <p>Within the consumer movement during the 1930s, the chief critic of the automotive industry, Dewey
                    Palmer, charged that automobile manufacturers' policies abused the buying public and the
                    national economy. According to Palmer, the technical supervisor at Consumers Union, the industry
                    exploited the average man's desire for status by providing a delusion of grandeur.
                    Automotive advertising and planned obsolescence conditioned Americans to desire excessive power and
                    speed, flashy eye appeal, and conspicuous display. The industry did virtually nothing to improve the
                    safety of its products or the economy of operation. Instead of safe and economical transportation,
                    the automotive industry contributed to the "inevitable depletion of our crude oil
                    supply" and left large portions of the population unable to afford new cars.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Automakers, of course, attempted to defend themselves from such criticism. Even before World War I

                    accidents. They started, for example, what they called a balanced traffic safety program. Under the
                    slogan of the "Three E's"—education, enforcement, and
                    engineering—automakers focused on driver behavior and road conditions. After the war they
                    claimed that greater safety could be achieved through a uniform vehicle code, safe driving classes,
                    and standard licensing of drivers, as well as more and better-planned streets and highways.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> By their organized efforts automakers helped to win endorsement for such
                    policies from the federal government and in the process undoubtedly helped to divert public
                    criticism from their own policies.</p>
            <p>When automakers did discuss basic policies regarding car designs and prices, they usually emphasized
                    their commitment both to high quality and to consumer sovereignty. According to that argument,
                    success came to those who offered, within commercial limitations, what consumers really wanted.
                    Prices increased because manufacturers responded to demand by improving their products and thus car
                    values. Even Nash, a small independent manufacturer, operated according to the slogan
                    "Build up to a standard, not down to a price."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> At General
                    Motors, which had been built during the 1920s upon the strategy of multiple models and annual
                    changes, one executive blandly confessed that the "automobile industry recognizes the
                    obsolescence factor in business and incorporates it in its every day practice.<hi rend="sup">"7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By employing the strategy of obsolescence some automakers, most notably General Motors, enjoyed
                    continuing profits despite the Depression, but economic conditions during the 1930s suggested to
                    others within the industry the need for change.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Manufacturers who did not do
                    well when new car sales fell had strong incentives to innovate. Thus, during the Depression decade
                    and up to the end of World War II, crisis within the industry created the opportunity and the
                    impetus, perhaps the last for some time, to alter marketing strategies. In any case this was a
                    period when the car culture underwent a severe test.</p>

            <p>One industry leader especially sensitive to the complex issues involved in success for the automotive
                    business was Paul G. Hoffman. The son of George Delos Hoffman, a prosperous and prominent inventor,
                    corporate executive, and entrepreneur from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Paul Hoffman attended the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> for one year before beginning to sell cars in 1909. Highly successful as a salesman and
                    sales manager, he started his own Studebaker dealership in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>
                    </placeName> ten years later. By 1925, when he became Studebaker's vice-president in charge
                    of sales, he was a thirty-four-year-old millionaire. He had also established a local reputation in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a businessman with broad vision and a strong sense of civic responsibility. Later,
                    as president of Studebaker and especially as administrator of the Marshall Plan following World War
                    II, Paul Hoffman won acclaim for statesmanship of the first rank. After 1950 he put his ability to
                    good use as the first president of the Ford Foundation and after 1958 as the director of the United
                    Nations Special Fund for economic development. For about half a century, until his retirement in
                    1972 at the age of eighty, Hoffman stood as a champion of technological progress, economic growth,
                    and democratic freedoms.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever his higher motives, Hoffman never pretended that his involvement in civic affairs was
                    exclusively altruistic. Starting in the 1930s he forcefully preached, by word and deed, a managerial
                    philosophy of enlightened self-interest. He always assumed that the profit motive and corporate
                    pursuit of economic gain, when properly informed, were compatible with the public welfare.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> His own involvement in civic affairs in part grew out of his desire to create
                    a healthy economic climate in which car sales thrived, and through that involvement he enhanced the
                    visibility of Studebaker, which was struggling to survive bankruptcy after 1933, as well as his own
                    reputation.</p>
            <p>Neither typical of the industry nor a complete maverick, Hoffman stood well within the mainstream of

                    1929 that the car was and would always remain "America's greatest plaything and
                    greatest necessity." As a top automotive executive and, almost by default, the
                    industry's "apostle of safety," he addressed the major questions raised
                    about "America's great personal transportation system."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> In two areas Hoffman played a major role in the automotive industry's effort to
                    shape the car culture. He promoted what he called sound urban development based on highway
                    construction, and he provided the managerial leadership that determined Studebaker's
                    innovative approach to car design. His experience in both areas indicates that even with a
                    philosophy of enlightened self-interest he could not resolve the complex issues surrounding the
                    automobile.</p>
            <p>For car sales to thrive, Hoffman realized, motorists needed adequate roads. During the early 1920s,
                    while he was a car dealer in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>
                    </placeName>, booming sales created chaotic traffic congestion. The increasing number of automobiles
                    on city streets raised public concern about safety and briefly led city officials to ban downtown
                    parking. Hoffman quickly recognized the threat to car sales. In an effort to combat the problem he
                    became chairman of the road committee of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>

                    </placeName>, a nongovernmental body on which he served as president. Hoffman insisted that sound
                    policies had to be based on scientific study of the facts; therefore, the Traffic Commission hired
                    the well-known firm of planning experts headed by Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. According to the
                    resulting report, which Hoffman delivered to city officials, traffic safety in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>
                    </placeName> could be improved by properly planned streets. Olmsted's firm urged the city
                    to widen existing streets, separate some intersections by grade, and expand construction into
                    outlying areas for future needs.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Such policies of course stood to boost car

            <p>When Hoffman became a vice-president of Studebaker in 1925, he expanded his effort to promote
                    scientific study of traffic problems. He knew that public statements of good intent did not improve
                    safety or win public approval; so, in 1926, he persuaded <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> to establish the Bureau for Street Traffic Research, financed with $10,000 a
                    year from the Studebaker Corporation and named for Studebaker's president, Albert Russel
                    Erskine. Free from direct interference by Hoffman or other automakers, the bureau conducted serious
                    research on accidents and provided a year's academic instruction in traffic control for
                    respresentatives from city and state engineering departments.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Such activity,
                    of course, also helped to forge an alliance of vested interests among government highway
                    departments, academic safety experts, and the automotive industry. Hoffman himself participated in
                    the national conferences on street and highway safety called by secretaries of commerce Herbert
                    Hoover and Robert Lamont.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Like other industry spokesmen, Hoffman emphasized driver behavior as a key to safety. Vigorous law
                    enforcement aimed at the minority of reckless, drunk, or other accident-prone drivers could, he
                    claimed, substantially lower the accident rate. With this quite sensible approach he hoped to head
                    off controls that could retard car sales. The intent of such enforcement, according to Hoffman,
                    should be to educate drivers about safety, not to punish violators or to raise revenues. Hoffman
                    also did not want states to impose absolute speed limits or to require speed governors on cars.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ironically, the apostle of safety was also an apostle of speed. During the late 1920s and early
                    1930s, while Hoffman was Studebaker's vice-president in charge of sales, the
                    company's advertising emphasized speed performance, including the success of its engines in
                    racing cars.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Hoffman personally insisted that the American public demanded
                    speed as well as safety and that reliable capability for speed and acceleration actually contributed
                    to safety. In any case, he suggested, speed was one measure of civilization. Dr. Louis I. Dublin, a

                    "outrageous" Hoffman's comment concerning the relationship between speed
                    and civilization. The Studebaker vice-president retaliated by ridiculing <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dublin</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s outlandish notion of an absolute speed limit of 35 miles per hour. Such a
                    proposal, he pointed out, would merely generate news without anyone taking it seriously,
                    particularly in a country of vast distances with people always in a hurry.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
                    During the early 1930s, however, automakers decided to eliminate references to top speed from their
                        advertising.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By 1930 the Depression had created other obstacles for Hoffman's safety program. Street and
                    highway construction, though supported by some as public works projects to provide jobs, became more
                    difficult to finance. States greatly increased taxes on gasoline, making driving costs much higher,
                    and many states diverted those revenues to nonhighway uses.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Within the
                    automotive industry support for traffic safety fell as sales fell. Hoffman realized that Studebaker
                    could not afford, virtually alone, to support the Bureau for Street Traffic Research. As a director
                    of the Automobile Manufacturers Association and chairman of its Traffic Safety Committee, he tried
                    unsuccessfully to get other automakers to assume the financial burden.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the automobile manufacturers supported safety research, Hoffman argued, the industry would benefit
                    from the resulting substantial improvement in traffic congestion and would receive favorable
                    publicity as well. According to Hoffman, who still owned a dealership in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>
                    </placeName>, lack of street facilities, parking, and proper traffic regulation created sales
                    resistance. In urban areas many who could afford to own cars did not do so because commuting daily
                    by public transportation was more convenient than driving. He nevertheless rejected the pessimistic
                    conclusions of some industry observers that the car market had reached saturation. He claimed that
                    even during the Depression car sales would increase if traffic conditions improved. The future of
                    the industry depended, Hoffman averred, on proper traffic safeguards and, even more importantly,

            <p>The Automobile Manufacturers Association responded slowly to Hoffman's prodding; even his
                    Traffic Safety Committee approved a few publicity releases without doing much else. Then, in 1935, a
                    sensationalistic article on traffic fatalities appeared in <hi rend="i">Reader's
                    Digest</hi> and generated widespread public discussion when civic organizations distributed millions
                    of reprints. Although the article focused on bad driving as the chief cause of accidents, it did
                    refer to the car as the "deadliest missile," and its gory details gave ammunition
                    to those advocating stiffer governmental restrictions on highway use. Hoffman quickly responded to
                    that threat by asking the Automobile Manufacturers Association to support a major safety program.
                    Fearing the adverse impact of such publicity on legislation and sales, the trade association
                    instructed Hoffman's committee to study the problem.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hoffman conferred with Walter Pyke Johnson, <placeName>

                    </placeName> representative and vice-president of the Automobile Manufacturers Association, and
                    other members of the Traffic Safety Committee. They agreed that action was needed. The entire
                    industry, not just the manufacturers, had to finance a major effort to improve traffic safety.
                    Hoffman recommended that the industry leave the actual operations of the safety program to
                    independent experts and avoid publicity or credit for itself. The return on investment would come
                    when accident rates, and thus adverse comment, declined.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In January, 1936, the Automobile Manufacturers Association launched its first serious highway safety
                    program. Budgeted at $450,000 the experimental project received a large personal

            <p>In his new capacity Hoffman argued that the industry's balanced safety program was
                    succeeding. Industry critics, citing statistics calculated on car registrations, had reported
                    frightfully high accident rates. Hoffman countered with statistics calculated on mileage driven to
                    show that the rates were actually declining.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Further success, according to
                    Hoffman, required an "enlightened and organized public opinion" willing to pay for
                    massive highway construction. At a time when <placeName>

                    100,000 miles of "accident proof highways. Such a system, a challenge for the American
                    spirit of enterprise, by Hoffman's calculation would cost $57 billion, would
                    take twenty-five years to build, and could be financed over forty-three years.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those advocates who linked safety and solution of traffic hazards with highway construction were very
                    persuasive in the late 1930s. State highway departments and local politicians, as well as the
                    automotive industry, agreed that an expanded highway system could help solve traffic problems.
                    Highway construction, particularly of expressways, could create for motorists a traffic utopia.
                    Congestion and safety hazards could be reduced, while employment in the construction industry could
                    be stimulated. The prospect that such a program might receive federal financing made it especially
                        attractive.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>Some urban planners and political reformers saw still another function for highway construction. In
                    the same spirit that built the New Deal's greenbelt towns, they would use highway
                    construction for social and economic regeneration. City slums with their out-moded business
                    sections, deteriorating housing, and inadequate transportation would be replaced by modern low-cost
                    housing and modern facilities. Even the enormously popular General Motors Futurama exhibit at the <placeName>

                        light.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though Hoffman supported highway construction, he criticized some of the schemes for urban
                    regeneration discussed in the late 1930s. The ideal solution to America's housing and
                    transportation needs, he felt, was sound city planning based on what the American people really
                        wanted.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Back in the 1920s Studebaker president Albert Erskine had praised
                    suburbs for strengthening American families.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Hoffman himself appreciated
                    suburban living; he had grown up in a suburb of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and his family had settled in a suburb of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>
                    </placeName>. When the census of 1940 appeared, he pointed to the growth of suburbs as further proof
                    that Americans preferred to live outside overcrowded and expensive cities.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hoffman's notion of sound planning called for city slums to be replaced by safe freeways and
                    parking facilities. Slum residents and workers would be relocated in low-cost housing built in rural
                    areas where land cost less. The proper balance between space and population density could be
                    achieved, he thought, by 1961, the same year that General Motors had envisioned the advent of
                    utopia. Freeways would then allow people to commute safely and efficiently by private cars between
                    where they wanted to live, in suburbs, and where they worked, in cities.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

                    even national unity. Not incidently, an expanded highway system would also revitalize the car
                    market, which had sagged during the Depression, for suburbs had begun to depend more upon
                    automobiles than upon streetcars for transportation.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Depression, when Americans began to buy more cars, Hoffman returned to his emphasis on
                    highway construction as a solution to traffic congestion. The connection between the automotive
                    industry's traffic safety program and its promotion of highway construction, present from
                    the creation of the Automobile Safety Foundation, had become clearer in 1942. In that year the ASF
                    broadened its charter to include support for "development on a sound financial and
                    engineering basis of modern street and highway facilities." Hoffman, the
                    industry's "guiding spirit" of traffic safety, remained as chairman of
                    the ASF, but he passed the presidency to Pyke Johnson, a longtime highway booster.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> By 1944 officials of the Automobile Safety Foundation were alerting Hoffman that accidents
                    and congestion were pushing traffic safety back into the limelight. Johnson, of course, hoped to
                    avoid governmental restrictions that could hurt the industry; accordingly, the ASF suggested that
                    highway construction could solve the traffic problem and also give a boost to the postwar
                        economy.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the postwar era Hoffman promoted his ideas in public forums. At President Harry S.
                    Truman's Highway Safety Conference, for example, he emphasized driver education and highway
                    construction as solutions to traffic problems. Rising congestion and accidents, he declared,
                    resulted from traffic volume and density beyond road capacity. What America still needed was a
                    system of modern expressways. Never losing sight of the profit incentive, Hoffman told car dealers
                    that they had to back such a program or lose customers. If congestion and <list type="footnotes">

                    people would stop commuting to work by car. So much did Hoffman believe in the benefits of highway
                    construction that during the mid–1950s, when no longer active in the automotive industry,
                    he personally lobbied on behalf of the federal interstate system.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite the automotive industry's success in diverting public concern over safety into
                    support for highway construction, questions about car design and economy could not be entirely
                    avoided. Hoffman personally addressed such issues within the management of Studebaker. During the
                    mid–1920s, while a vice-president of the corporation, he fought against annual model
                    changes as illogical, costly, "artificial obsoletion" and argued for cars that
                    were practical and economical.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> During the Depression Studebaker made a serious
                    effort to use economy of operation as a sales argument; thus, the company pioneered in and
                    advertised new technology to reduce fuel consumption and frequency of lubrication. Hoffman himself
                    believed that the nation needed smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, perhaps even four-seaters, as
                    families became smaller.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hoffman realized, however, that commercial realities required compromises. As did other industry
                    spokesmen, he claimed that consumer sovereignty dictated what the market offered. In a modern
                    society of abundance and "discretionary spending power," the public could stop
                    buying when products lacked appeal; therefore, business had to adopt policies that constantly
                    induced people to spend. Market research, which Studebaker employed by the mid-1980s, provided
                    manufacturers with clues about public preferences. With those clues automobile companies could use

            <p>According to Hoffman, American automakers met their responsibilities, within commercial limitations,
                    by offering the safest cars possible. Ignoring the failure to adopt European improvements, such as
                    monocoque—all-welded single-unit—body construction, Hoffman pointed to
                    American improvements of the 1920s and 1930s. All-steel closed bodies, lower centers of gravity,
                    four-wheel hydraulic brakes, wider tires, easier shifting and steering, safety glass, better
                    mirrors, and windshield wipers proved that manufacturers cared about safety.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
                    Studebaker's chief engineer, Delmar G. "Barney" Roos, who led in the
                    development of more rigid bodies in 1934 models, urged the entire industry to cooperate with
                    agencies of state governments to make cars safer.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> When, in 1937, Chrysler
                    redesigned car interiors, including dashboards, to reduce hazards, Studebaker and a few other
                    manufacturers quickly followed that example. As president of Studebaker, Hoffman operated on the
                    assumption that safety features actually helped sell cars.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 1939 Studebaker Champion best demonstrated how Hoffman's concerns about safety and
                    economy blended with his sense of commercial realities. Of conventional size and price, the Champion
                    demonstrated improved fuel efficiency through weight reduction. The entire car was designed around
                    the passenger compartment to provide greater safety, and it featured a more rigid frame and lower
                    body to increase stability and ease of handling. One promotional film even showed the Champion being
                    driven off a ramp over the hood of another car with no resulting damage.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

            <p>Industry observers immediately praised the Champion's design. <hi rend="i">Fortune</hi>
                    speculated that it might start a trend back to a real American "people's
                    car," something that disappeared in the 1920s with the Model T. Consumers Union rated the
                    Champion with overdrive a "best buy" and praised the simple design that <list type="footnotes">

                    the industry, reported that the Champion had the best all-around characteristics in the low-priced
                    field. He singled out in particular its ability to provide both adequate performance and economy.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although it received critical acclaim and market success, the Champion did not set a trend toward
                    significantly cheaper cars. In fact, when sales lagged briefly in 1940, Studebaker followed a policy
                    common in the industry. The company increased the car's power and weight and freshened the
                    line with deluxe two-toned bodies and harmonized two-toned upholstery. Prices, of course, also
                    increased. The strategy apparently succeeded, for overall sales during 1940 were even better than in
                    the previous year.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Attempts by other automakers to offer low-priced and more fuel-efficient cars during the late 1930s
                    confirmed the judgments of Studebaker's market research. The Bantam and the Crosley,
                    inexpensive "midget" models built by new companies, failed to sell and suggested
                    that Americans would not buy the kind of small cars sold in Europe. Nor, apparently, would the
                    American consumer buy conventional-sized models that were stripped down to provide more fuel economy
                    at a cheaper price. In 1937 both Ford and Willys Overland introduced such cars, which were
                    underpowered and lacked even hydraulic brakes. Both failed. Nevertheless, Willys's chief
                    engineer, Barney Roos, who had left Studebaker in 1936 and who later designed the Jeep, continued to
                    believe in the commercial feasibility of a car designed for cheap transportation with reasonable
                    comfort and safety.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>George Mason, president of Nash after 1936, had a similar vision. A motorcycle enthusiast, <placeName>

                    </placeName> believed that a small, light-weight car with a low retail price and low operating costs

                    Nash, in 1940, followed Studebaker's strategy of offering greater fuel economy in a
                    conventionally priced car. While Studebaker achieved economy mainly by reducing the weight of the
                    engine and transmission, Nash introduced monocoque construction. Used in Europe since the late
                    1920s, the all-welded single-unit body provided greater strength and durability with lighter weight
                    than did conventional bolted-together body and chassis. With that change Nash increased its sales to
                    second among independents, behind only Studebaker.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

            <p>The modest gains made by Studebaker and Nash, while not based on radical departures, did reveal the
                    potential for innovation within the automotive industry. Even with the end of the recession in the
                    late 1930s, manufacturers still faced a depressed economy and limited market. Many Americans simply
                    could not afford to buy the kinds of new cars available in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Some observers felt that, for the market to expand significantly, manufacturers would
                    have to introduce a substantially different kind of car. As a result, during the late 1930s and
                    early 1940s, speculation grew as to the possibility of a new car for the common man. The biggest
                    obstacle to the creation of a safe, streamlined, fuel-efficient car that would sell for
                    $400 instead of $600 to $800 appeared to be the high production
                    costs associated with all-steel bodies. A few industrialists, notably Henry Ford and Henry J.
                    Kaiser, supported experiments with new technologies and new materials. Aluminum, magnesium, plywood,
                    plastics, and fiberglass all proved inacceptable because of high costs and technical
                        difficulties.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Then World War II interrupted car production and the efforts
                    to produce a radically new kind of car.</p>
            <p>Had American family incomes remained depressed and had fuel costs remained high after the war,
                    efforts to produce a safe, cheap car for the common man might have persisted. Economic conditions

            <p>Led by Hoffman, Studebaker did, nevertheless, offer the public a boldly innovative low-priced car

                    this truly distinctive car by fighting the big enemy, weight. At the time, Exner claimed that the
                    average motorist did not want bulky, bulbous, ponderous, elephantine cars that were costly to buy
                    and to operate. For heavy city traffic, where most driving was done, motorists preferred ease of
                    handling and economy achieved by lighter and sleeker cars.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> If sales volume

            <p>For all Hoffman's energy and intelligence in running Studebaker, however, he never entirely
                    resolved major questions about the American automotive industry and the transportation system that
                    it fostered. On one hand he claimed that the competitive market, even within the oligopolistic
                    automotive industry, reflected the genuine preferences of consumers.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> The
                    buyers' judgment was supposed to be the final measure of the public good. On the other hand
                    he often disapproved of what consumers chose. Hoffman argued, for example, that Americans needed
                    both better highways and smaller, less powerful, and safer cars. Under his management Studebaker

                    to thoughtful consumers, but during the 1950s cheap gasoline permitted monstrous waste. Thus Exner,
                    the Studebaker designer who had promoted light, sleek, and economical cars during the 1940s, changed
                    his mind; moving to Chrysler, he created the oversized and successful "forward
                    look." Hoffman held true to his convictions. Even in 1956, when Americans were buying
                    larger and more powerful cars, he wrote: "The day is surely coming when a more sensible
                    type of motor car than those now offered will be in great demand."<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The postwar boom in which Studebaker for a time participated also brought with it worse traffic
                    congestion and more accidents. At least until the 1960s the automotive industry managed to escape
                    the kind of scrutiny to which it was subjected during the 1930s. By the 1970s, however, the
                    significant questions that Hoffman and his contemporaries addressed but failed to answer reemerged
                    to plague automakers. Critics blamed the oligopolistic nature of the industry for uneconomical and
                    unsafe cars. Some cited too much competition, others too little, as a cause for high prices, annual
                    model changes, too few safety devices, and other undesirable features.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> In many
                    ways such criticism indicted broader aspects of American culture as well as the automotive industry.
                    General affluence, mass markets, and American democratic values had, after all, made not only
                    conspicuous consumption and wastefulness but also love of technology and mobility prominent social
                    traits long before the advent of cars and car advertisements. The automotive industry, including
                    Hoffman, shrewdly exploited attitudes already widespread in America; it undoubtedly reinforced and
                    expanded such attitudes, but it did not create them. The automobile has without question contributed
                    to metropolitan sprawl, suburban growth, and high energy costs, but only the worst sort of tunnel
                    vision can overlook the American preference for privacy as exemplified by the single-family home and
                    privately owned car. Similarly, the decline of mass transit systems was due primarily to the
                    American commuters' desire for privacy and greater freedom of movement, not to nefarious
                    schemes on the part of automakers to deprive the public of alternative means of transportation.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

            <p>Hoffman understood very well the popular preferences of the American public. He also always believed
                    that with adequate roads and the right cars on the market Americans would choose what others later
                    called automobility, and he did his best to see that the automotive industry provided the public
                    with the opportunity to make that choice. Whether or not the public's preference for
                    private automobiles is compatible with the best interests of society in the long run, however,

                            even helped arrange interviews that otherwise might have been declined. Principal among

                    through Solsberry and involved one major problem—the crossing of a spacious valley three
                    miles west of town at the confluence of Richland and Beech creeks. At this point trains would have
                    to "take to the air" for almost a half-mile of track, a record span for an
                    American railroad and surpassed only by the Gerabit viaduct in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, through Solsberry, to the east end. It was a convenient separation, and altogether
                    necessary in view of the animosity which immediately erupted between the two groups.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

                    entertainment they spent their evenings gambling, fighting, and drinking quantities of wine
                    concocted at the campsites. No one can say how many were killed one way or another, but the local
                    inhabitants still speak darkly of the roadbed's having been built on the bones of Italians.</p>

            <p>The community viewed these exotic visitors with detachment, amused by their strange ways but
                    otherwise unconcerned. As the deadline for completion neared, gangs on both sides of the trestle
                    worked around the clock, Sundays included. When asked if this aroused any disapproval among the good
                    churchgoers of the township, one Solsberry resident replied: "No… I
                    don't think there was ever a word said. They didn't complain about that, because
                    it wasn't our people."27 Local residents were equally tolerant of the drinking.
                    For that matter, homemade whiskey ("darned good booze") had always been a dietary
                    staple around Solsberry.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Once back in 1854 the Reverend George Richey had

            <p>In due course, through narrow cuts and over steep-sided fills, the rails came to the valley that was
                    to be crossed by the viaduct. From old photographs it appears that the steel web was assembled from
                    above, piece by piece, by a rail crane advancing over each section as it was completed.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Never before had there been such a grand spectacle around Solsberry. People
                    came from miles away, by wagon and surrey, on horseback, and on foot, to see the giant structure
                    take shape. Many came from log-hewn farmsteads deep in the forest, over roads little better than the
                    Indian trails they traced. Whole families would bring Sunday dinner and spend the day gossiping,
                    visiting the concession stands in the meadow below, watching the workmen, fascinated by the din and
                        danger.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Rumor tells of many accidents, but only one fatality was actually
                        reported.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Even that incident was converted (through the light-hearted
                    disrespect for fact that still characterizes Solsberry humor) into the story of a man wearing gum

                    a logyard, now dominated the town. The entire populace came to greet the first train, filled with
                    dignitaries. School was let out, and small boys drunk with excitement held their ears to the rails
                    to detect the approaching vibrations and were the first to swarm over the locomotive and cars on
                    arrival. The dignitaries are long gone, but in the memories of a few of those children now grown old

                    roadbed, insert new ties, and spike all in place "whangedy-whang" between
                        trains.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> The railroad also employed stationmasters, telegraph operators,

            <p>Almost overnight Solsberry became a railroad town, a shipping point for produce and livestock and for
                    the great saw-logs from trees that would otherwise have aged, died, fallen, and rotted in the forest
                    as in eons past. Showers Brothers furniture factory in <placeName>

                    and tulip tree—and in summertime and fall loaded wagons drawn by "the prettiest
                    horses you ever saw" converged on the town, usually helped up that last hill by a
                    "snap team" of two or four additional horses.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> During good
                    weather the quantity of logs brought in far surpassed the number which could be loaded onto flatcars
                    by the "gin-pole" operator, and the excess piled up everywhere—even in
                    the churchyard—for shipment during the winter. Second-grade logs usually went to the
                    steam-powered sawmill operated by the Jenkins brothers, to be cut into mine
                    timbers—props, caps, and narrow-gauge ties—and shipped in the opposite

                    crew were on hand—a congenial night's rest. The railroaders made pets of the
                    children, taught them how to hop a train properly, and even slowed the <placeName>

                    all the way through town. "I used to have to cut up tree-tops to keep our stove
                    going," says Bernard Glover, "but after the train came through I never chopped
                    wood again. The whole town burned coal!"<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

                    Charley Barnes, who was brought in for the express purpose of subduing Carl

            <p>These and other changes cultural, economic, and political tumbled in on Solsberry as if to make
                    restitution for the long years of inactivity. The town basked in sudden ascendancy over neighboring
                    communities bypassed by the rails, such as Hendricksville, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newark</settlement>

                    two miles north of their town.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> More than anything else, the
                    community's love affair with the railroad arose from the simple comparison between its
                    earlier stagnant condition and the benefits of a brand-new export economy. To a youngster growing
                    up, the newly thriving town was a paradise of excitement, and by young and old alike the railroad
                    was deemed a benefactor, free of the charges of oppression and exploitation of which great railroads
                    in the West stood accused. For one thing, before there was time to consolidate any kind of monopoly,
                    other forces were stirring. Already roads were being improved, foreshadowing the age of motor
                    transport. Even as the first trains began rolling, the first automobile clattered into town.</p>
            <p>The arrival of the first car was not altogether a happy event. It seems that the Beard brothers, who

                    new contraptions, and everyone turned out to see it arrive. Those who came from a distance hitched
                    their horses to a long iron rack outside the Beards' store while they waited and swapped
                    stories. "We heard that car coming," says Bernard Glover. "Oh, you could
                    hear it! It made a racket like nothing ever heard before. And here he come over the hill, and
                    everybody just standing and waiting. We never any of us seen a car before. And it made this terrific
                    noise and the horses broke and pulled that big hitching rack out of the ground. They ran and just
                    piled up at the bottom of the hill, rigs and all. Killed two or three of them."<hi rend="sup">44</hi> The episode soured the citizenry on automobiles (and on the Beards) for a

            <p>Considering the absence of much contemporary comment by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> citizens and in light of the general acceptance of the Lynds' opinions by
                    America's educated elite, Straton's counter-views are worth considering. Straton
                    was a next-door neighbor of William H. Ball, one of the sons of the brothers who founded the Ball
                    glass industry and a person mentioned by the Lynds. Alice Aven Straton, Hillyer's wife, has
                    stated that during the eight years she and her husband spent in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> they mixed frequently with what the Lynds considered the ruling elite of the town.
                    Straton's ministerial work, however, took him into all types of homes in all parts of the
                    city. Straton's vocation and education prepared him to be a better-than-average observer of
                    society; and although he possessed biases common to his time, place, and position, he does appear to
                    be a sincere critic of the Lynds. To some extent time has given his views support, since several
                    modern scholars tend to agree with his evaluation that the Lynds brought their conclusions with them
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> and believed they had found proof to support their biases there. As the following

               <hi rend="sup">5</hi> It is quite generally felt that Robert

                    hypotheses rather than to prove his values. If he is honest and self-critical he does not seek to

            <p>Both books have been hailed by critics far and wide as the last word in sociological accuracy. Stuart
                    Chase says that the latest book is "a great study, careful, <hi rend="i">fair,</hi> charged
                    with the long view."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> How he knows is a puzzle for he has never been
                    here. There is a general consensus of opinion in this city that where the Lynds deal with
                    statistical matters such as government census records, they are accurate and do present a true
                    picture of the community such as in the fine chapter on Getting A Living. Our outstanding local
                        editor<hi rend="sup">8</hi> sums up this attitude when he says, "Eliminate from it all
                    the old wives' tales which the Lynds evidently absorbed and then printed as truth and give
                    both sides of controversial subjects which was not always done, and <placeName>

            <p>When dealing with matters of philosophy, especially regarding political and economic theories,
                    preconceived views color the work so drastically that anything but a true picture is presented. A
                    local columnist said, "They came here with a preconceived notion of what <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>
                    </placeName> should be, and merely looked for a hook on which to hang their prefabricated coat of
                    drab colors. Blind to everything else, they found certain things they were seeking, quickly

            <p>This is nowhere more glaring than in Lynd's development of his hypothesis of the
                    X's as a "reigning royal family… who dominated the town, are the town
                    in fact.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Scientific accuracy is thrown overboard in order to present the
                    X's as an octopus with its benevolent tenacles in everything, squeezing the life out of us
                    poor devils who have to dance to their tune.</p>
            <p>A small but typical illustration of inexcusable inaccuracy is the reference to the "two new
                    X subdivisions in the West end… where the X's live. Since 1925 the X family has
                    literally moved the residential heart of the city… This shift has been carefully
                    engineered by members of the X family."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The facts are, and Lynd had
                    access to them had he asked, that credit should go to a leading real estate dealer. This man was
                    close enough to the Lynds to provide the map for the recent volume and to receive an autographed
                    copy of the book from Robert Lynd. Never once was he asked regarding the two subdivisions or the
                    move to the west part of the city. One of the younger X's<hi rend="sup">12</hi> did put up
                    a fourth interest in the first development, two other young men supplying a fourth each and the
                    realtor his fourth. As for the newer subdivision, it is owned and was developed completely by the
                    realtor in question.</p>
            <p>The shift to the west end was inevitable because of its freedom from industry and railroad tracks.
                    The college was located there and another family of wealth had built or planned large estates in
                    that section. The X's had no more to do with the shift than any other of a half a dozen
                    citizens who wished to live there.</p>
            <p>Lynd states, "Through the early 1920's when the normal school was quickening into
                    life, the X real estate agents were quietly buying up parcel after parcel of residential property in
                    the then socially nondescript Normal School section of town."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> This
                    becomes positively vicious in its untruth when he adds, "These houses have subsequently
                    been removed or improved and these extensive operations must have involved a tidy profit to the X
                    family as promoters <hi rend="i">offsetting their benevolences to the hospital and

            <p>Again what are the facts? Property due west of the hospital was purchased for future expansion of the
                    hospital units and to provide adequate rental property for laboratory technicians and other
                    professional people. A full 1925–1930 market value was paid for this property the owner
                    setting the sale price in each instance. The bulk of it today would bring considerably less than its
                    purchase price. The X's own only 5% of residential property in this section much of it
                    undeveloped. The scientific value of the statement that the X benevolences to the hospital and
                    college are offset by the unearned increment of their real estate holdings can be judged when you
                    know that these gifts are nearly twice as large as the total assessed value of <hi rend="i">all</hi>

                    divided into the average 75 foot city lot, each would have to sell for over $75,000.00 to
                    equal the X gifts to the college and hospital. Such rabid economy with the truth in order to develop
                    a hypothesis is quite unbecoming one who considers himself a "scientific social
                    investigator."</p>
            <p>Because of their large gifts to X State Teachers College, it is natural to expect the X's to
                    have a voice in its management, but they have been liberal in their policies and have shown complete
                    willingness to have speakers come to the campus with views possibly divergent from their own. Lynd
                    leaves the general impression that the college and its faculty is as subservient to the X's
                    as he contends are the bankers, business men and preachers. In one place he says, "the
                    local college is said to be X controlled both in its larger policies and in occasional smaller
                        details."<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Yet the National Secretary of the Socialist Party has

            <p>What sort of people are the X's anyway? They are not perfect, they have their share of
                    faults, but by and large it would be hard to find a higher type of American citizen. To an unusual
                    degree, they recognize their wealth as a public trust. Simple in their taste and unostentatious in
                    their manner of life they almost lean over backwards in the democracy of their attitudes. [When the

                    questioning other of his conclusions. For purposes of invidious comparison, wage scales of 1935,

                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>

                    were up over 100%, employed? Because Lynd wants to draw a picture of the business leaders of <placeName>

                    </placeName> consciously holding down the standard of living of the working class.</p>
            <p>The facts are that today the hourly rate in most industries here is over 25% more than in 1929 and
                    the <hi rend="i">actual</hi> income is above that of 1929, with the men working forty instead of
                    fifty and sixty hours. If the rates are somewhat less than in metropolitan centers, the cost of
                    living is likewise less. <placeName>

                    small farms and are thereby able to produce much of their own food products.</p>
            <p>[Constant reference is made to the low X wage scale. This too is open to debate and there are
                    compensating factors such as the]. In the X plant for instance there is a group life insurance
                    policy for each employee paid wholly by the company. They warehouse products in off seasons to
                    insure continuance of employment. An X job often means one for life. At present there are 18
                    employees who have been there over 40 years, 62 employees over 30 years and 152 over 20 years. Over
                    ten percent of the employees have been with the company longer than 20 years.</p>
            <p>Lynd's propensity for anything that is radical, "new-dealish", or liberal
                    is exhibited time and again. According to Lynd, there is only one church, "that of a small

            <p>This radical attitude is probably the genesis of one of the most uncalled-for and inaccurate
                    statements in the entire book. The president of the local college<hi rend="sup">24</hi> is referred
                    to as "‘just one more small-time politician’ irrelevantly put in
                    charge of a state educational institution to divert him from running for Congress."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> All of this is ostensibly maneuvered by the X's. If the X's
                    wanted to keep such a man from Congress why in the name of sanity did they put him in charge of the
                    school in which they have such a large monetary interest? Likewise why did they appoint him as an
                    outside director of a new Foundation they have just established?</p>
            <p>The facts are that this man is unusually statesman-like. He has constantly stood for forward-looking

                    of the conservative thinkers in our nation and so he is maligned just because he refuses to stumble
                    after every will-o-the-wisp of "planned economy." Were a vote taken to discover
                    the most useful and the best loved man in this community, apart from the X's, this man
                    would unquestionably be chosen.</p>

                    </placeName> people is their small-town delight in gossip. This is true in churches, clubs, business
                    offices and around lamp posts. Lynd is justly criticized for using this "flannel mouthed
                    gossip" as a prominent business man put it, as the basis for so many of his assertions.</p>
            <p>However, after having said this, if <placeName>

                    </placeName> is typical in any way of the best of American culture it is in its people. A leading
                    citizen well said that the Lynds applied to this community every device known to the investigator
                    except the stethoscope and thereby they missed its heart, its most vital organ. There is a
                    comraderie about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> people that is heartening. There are differences in physical possessions but the
                    democratic tradition is hale and hearty here. A man is respected for what he is and not for what he
                    has. In our churches, lodges, and community affairs those in high station and low work shoulder to
                    shoulder for the common good, totally devoid thank God, of the poison of class consciousness. The
                    sons of the rich and the sons of the poor sit side by side in the same school, go to the same camp
                    and play in the homes of one another. When the time comes to make the greatest decision in life the
                    sons and daughters of the rich marry those in moderate and even poor circumstances and are
                    themselves strengthened thereby.</p>
            <p>The American frontier of opportunity to rise is not closed to the people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the Lynds to the contrary. We have a splendid group of younger self-made men. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> youth with ambition finds a hundred helping hands and a thousand cheering voices urging
                    him on. If there is not the chance to rise from the factory floor there once was there are double
                    and triple the chances to get specialized training and come back into responsible positions in the
                    plant.</p>
            <p>There have been numbers of instances in which factory managers have arranged working schedules so
                    that a young man can work six hours at night and take a full course in the local college. There is a
                    boy here that comes definitely to mind. He is from a home of the most limited advantages. His father
                    is paralyzed from the hips down, his mother works in a local factory. Clean, upstanding and hard
                    working his ambition is to be a lawyer. There is only one way for him to attain his goal and that is
                    to work in a local plant and go to college at the same time. This he is doing and some day he will
                    arrive for he has it in him.</p>
            <p>Muncie has its faults, its failures, and its shortcomings, but its people have an abundance of
                    character, that quality that <pb n="264" id="VAA4025-079-3-062"/> has made our country great and
                    good. There is much to make our hearts ache, there is much that we need to improve. There is much
                    that we will change for the better. We are on our way and if "we are walking into the
                    future with our faces turned toward the past", we are at least marching forward and the
                    backward look is only to preserve the best in the culture that we have known.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Indiana Newspaper Bibliography</hi> is a significant contribution to historical
                    scholarship. A bibliography of Hoosier newspapers from the time Elihu Stout commenced the <hi rend="i">Indiana Gazette</hi> at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1804, as the state's initial paper, to 1980, the volume includes about
                    eight thousand titles. To the extent that information was found, data are given concerning
                    variations in titles, mergers, political or other affiliations, and names of editors and publishers.
                    The bibliography also notes where newspapers were published and when they began and ended.
                    Especially helpful to researchers are the listings of newspaper holdings in numerous depositories
                    within Indiana and selected ones elsewhere. This reviewer has already found these listings useful
                    even in locating particular issues of newspapers.</p>
            <p>Much labor over several years was required to compile this comprehensive bibliography. John W.
                    Miller, whose doctoral thesis at Purdue University concerned "The Pioneer Newspapers of
                    Indiana, 1804–1850," was appropriately chosen to head the project. As Miller
                    notes in the preface, "this bibliography should encourage increased interest in Indiana
                    newspapers"; promote the discovery of "‘lost’ issues of
                    newspapers"; and stimulate additional preservation of newspaper files (p. vii). The
                    information from which the bibliography was prepared has been recorded on computer tapes; hence, as
                    more data are obtained, they "can easily be entered on the tapes, and updated printouts of
                    holdings information can be produced quickly and inexpensively" (p. viii). Individuals
                    having further information should share it with the Indiana Historical Society.</p>
            <p>As the title suggests, <hi rend="i">Indiana Newspaper Bibliography</hi> is a <hi rend="i">bibliography</hi> and not a <hi rend="i">history</hi> of the Hoosier press. The compiler wisely
                    forewarns that the "bibliography undoubtedly contains errors…." It
                    could not be otherwise because discrepancies "among sources are common"; however,
                    an effort was made "to rely on actual copies of the newspapers for information,
                    supplemented by the most reliable secondary sources available" (p. vii). Though
                    indispensable as an aid to scholarly <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-079-3-064"/> studies of the Hoosier
                    press, additional research in actual newspaper files remains a prerequisite for such studies.
                    Commendation is due Miller and the Indiana Historical Society for this welcome publication, but
                    acknowledgment is also due the late Eli Lilly, whose foresight and benevolence made its compilation
                    and publication possible. If his benevolence is used with a devotion and wisdom even approximating
                    that which he exhibited regarding historical study, his unusually important contributions will be
                    enlarged from decade to decade.</p>

            <p>Author George Barr McCutcheon is best known for his fiction. His novels, for the most part written in
                    the genre of romantic realism, sold in the millions. Particularly popular was his Graustark series,
                    which chronicled life in a mythical Balkan country. McCutcheon's output was
                    tremendous—he wrote a total of more than forty novels—and his readership was
                    varied. According to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Times</hi> (October 24, 1928, p. 24), "college boys, kitchen maids, and
                    daughters of millionaires" found pleasure in his books.</p>
            <p>In contrast to his popularity as a novelist was McCutcheon's reputation as a playwright. He
                    published only two plays during his lifetime, each in limited editions of fewer than one hundred
                    copies. While doing research on another subject A.L. Lazarus discovered a collection of
                    McCutcheon's unpublished play manuscripts in the Purdue University Library. Other such
                    manuscripts were located in the Beinecke Library at Yale University and in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Public Library. <hi rend="i">Beyond Graustark</hi> includes a synopsis and discussion
                    of each of these plays; the authors' main purpose, however, was to evaluate
                    McCutcheon's work as a playwright. The book is also a biographical and literary study, in
                    which the authors relate McCutcheon's life to his writing and evaluate his popularity as a
                    novelist and his apparent failure as a dramatist. They indicate that writing plays was one of his
                    top priorities and that his "heart and best work were in the theater, but the theater was
                    not ready for him or his satires of Victorian mores" (p. xiv).</p>
            <p>For the most part, McCutcheon's plays dealt with social issues such as activist feminism,
                    unnecessary killing of wild <pb n="267" id="VAA4025-079-3-065"/> animals, male dominance in family
                    relations, abandoned children, snobbery, and euthanasia. McCutcheon tried again and again to get his
                    plays produced on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName> and other places but was not successful. Many of his novels were adapted for the
                    screen, but the legitimate theater continually eluded him. Lazarus and Jones indicate that it was
                    difficult for McCutcheon to accept that "undistinguished plays… by [George] Ade
                    and [Booth] Tarkington achieved successful production on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName> while GBMc's plays met with rejection by the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> theaters" (p. xiv). This rejection was due largely to the fact that the
                    Frohman syndicate owned or controlled most of the theaters in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and the management did not like the controversial subjects of the plays.</p>
            <p>This study of a well-known Indiana author is well written and presents new information. Because of
                    McCutcheon's prominence as a writer, because this is the first biography, and because of
                    the subject, <hi rend="i">Beyond Graustark</hi> is an important book.</p>

                    $14.50.)</head>
            <p>This is an exemplary monograph. Its topic is substantial but limited, its organization and argument
                    absolutely clear, and its documentation thorough. Certainly nobody could want more statistics about
                    meat packing in the Midwest from the 1840s to the 1870s than can be found here. Even historians who
                    prefer words—which are few in this little book—to numbers—which are
                    plentiful—should get a sober pleasure from observing something modest done thoroughly and
                    well.</p>
            <p>The author's argument for the significance of her topic begins with the observation that the
                    history of manufacturing has been studied primarily in mid-Atlantic and <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> settings, while midwestern economic development has been considered mainly in
                    agricultural terms. Those emphases correspond roughly to the actual experiences of the three
                    regions, but understanding the entire history of manufacturing requires at least some attention to
                    its development in the Midwest. Particular attention must be paid to the processing industries, such
                    as meat packing, which led the growth of manufacturing in the middle western region of the country.
                    Processing "disseminated an industrial experience and a modern technology" <pb n="268" id="VAA4025-079-3-066"/> (p. 6) that influenced the Midwest long after the early period
                    described here.</p>
            <p>The book focuses on how meat packing changed from a seasonal business, conducted by merchants who had
                    other interests to engage them when the weather was too warm for killing hogs, to a year-round
                    industry dominated by specialized manufacturers. The merchants survived at the end of the process,
                    which came in the 1870s, but they played a limited role in the national market that had emerged by
                    that time.</p>
            <p>The changes in the meat packing industry resulted from new technologies. Railroads extended the areas
                    in which packers could buy animals and sell meat. Some packing centers, such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, were encouraged to expand but then found themselves competing with larger
                    places, such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which in turn had to compete with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Railroads, therefore, furthered concentration in the industry, most notably in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Ice packing also shaped the meat packing industry and fostered concentration. In the early 1870s
                    packers began to use natural ice to cool meat, thus removing the industry's old seasonal
                    limitation. Entrepreneurs could afford to invest heavily in facilities that were used throughout the
                    year. Ice packing was superceded by mechanical refrigeration in the 1880s, but "the shape
                    of modern enterprise was visible" (p. 87) in the ice houses of the previous decade.</p>
            <p>Indiana historians should be interested in this study not only because the Hoosier state is within
                    the book's regional scope but also because it contains particular references to the
                    business histories of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The volume also illuminates the economics of hog raising, which should interest the
                    state's agricultural historians. The book merits an extensive audience among students and
                    teachers of Indiana history.</p>

            <p>For the most part John A. Logan has not fared well with historians. Union general, congressman,
                    senator, vice-presidential candidate, and founder of the Grand Army of the Republic, the Illinoisan
                    has been depicted as a Democrat who, <pb n="269" id="VAA4025-079-3-067"/> in a spirit of political
                    opportunism, turned Radical Republican and became intimately linked with the corruption of the
                    Ulysses S. Grant administration. In this second half of a two-volume biography of the colorful
                    Logan, James Pickett Jones has substantially altered his subject's unfortunate
                    historiographical image.</p>
            <p>Jones's goal is not to absolve "Black Jack" Logan of his sins but to write
                    a balanced account of his postwar career, a career which "defies the neat classifications
                    sometimes accorded him" (p. 227). The author accomplishes this aim. The Logan who emerges
                    in these pages is indeed a patronage boss and machine politician, but he is also a champion of Negro
                    rights and women's suffrage, a fighter for equality despite the fact that such a stand was
                    not politically profitable.</p>
            <p>Since Black Jack was an influential legislative activist, Jones's account touches upon most
                    of the major issues of Gilded Age politics. An antebellum member of Congress, Logan rejoined that
                    body as it approached its zenith of power during Reconstruction. His years on the Hill, during which
                    he "waved the bloody shirt" and became a leader of the Stalwart faction of the
                    GOP, were marked by his opposition to civil service reform, a measure which threatened his efforts
                    "to build a state machine out of the fabric of patronage" (p. 34). The former
                    volunteer general also opposed the professionally dominated regular army, using his position as
                    chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Committee to slash its appropriations.</p>
            <p>Jones is at his best when discussing election politics. He properly stresses the crucial role of
                    state political organizations during the postwar years, and his examination of Logan's
                    construction of a power base in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and development of a new style of campaigning is penetrating. Students of Indiana
                    politics will especially appreciate glimpses of Hoosiers George W. Julian, Walter Q. Gresham, and
                    particularly Oliver P. Morton, Logan's teammate in the "paper money
                    trinity" of 1874.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the volume is not without faults. The writing occasionally lacks clarity and is often
                    uneven, as Jones sacrifices flow in an allegiance to chronology. Moreover, given Logan's
                    central role in the GAR and his use of it for political purposes, one wishes there was more detailed
                    information on this unofficial arm of Republicanism. Still, Jones's work is valuable, for
                    it constitutes a much-needed revisionary portrayal of a flamboyant and powerful Gilded Age figure.</p>

                        </placeName> History of the United</hi> States are formidable indeed. According to general
                    editor C. Vann Woodward each historian's purpose is twofold: he is to strive for
                    "a readable text that will be readily accessible to the educated general public"
                    and to "provide students at various levels an interpretative synthesis of the findings of
                    recent scholarship as well as the essentials of narrative history in the period or subject being
                    treated" (p. xvi).</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">The Glorious Cause</hi> Robert Middlekauff has achieved the first of these
                    objectives. Despite its length, the narrative is absorbing. Middlekauff describes the disintegration
                    of imperial ties and the military history of the resulting war (to which subjects he devotes the
                    bulk of his book) in colorful detail. He successfully communicates a sense of the profound passion
                    with which Americans took up arms in the service of "the glorious cause."
                    Middlekauff is especially adept in his sympathetic portrait of George Washington as a resourceful
                    man making the best of near-impossible situations. <hi rend="i">The Glorious Cause</hi> is at the
                    very least a lively introduction to the events of the war for independence.</p>
            <p>The book fails, however, to attain the second objective of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> series: to provide (in Woodward's words) "an interpretative synthesis
                    of recent scholarship" (p. xvi) so that the "modern citizen" will not
                    have to "confront the present and the future with outdated misconceptions of the
                    past" (p. xv). Middlekauff's concentration on British politics and military
                    maneuvers is understandable; they were important. They are not, however, the major subjects with
                    which historians of the Revolution have been concerned in the last twenty years. In focusing upon
                    Parliament and battles Middlekauff has largely ignored the findings and hypotheses of recent
                    historians such as Gary Nash, Eric Foner, and Robert Gross. The concern of these and other
                    scholars—sometimes explicitly, but always implicitly—with Carl
                    Becker's familiar assertion that the Revolution was not just a question of "home
                    rule" but of "who should rule at home" has no place in
                    Middlekauff's book. Instead, he offers a consensual interpretation told from the point of
                    view of political and military leaders.</p>
            <pb n="271" id="VAA4025-079-3-069"/>
            <p>"To conceive of a republic and to fight for it in a world dominated by monarchy"
                    did, as Middlekauff notes, take "daring and imagination" (p. viii). But the
                    Revolution involved far more than winning independence; it involved defining the specifics of that
                    cause. The history of America from 1763 to 1789 is a story of conflict, conflict with Great Britain
                    and conflict among various groups of Americans with dramatically different notions about the nature
                    and viability of a republic.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, this book is troubling because its story is so familiar. It does little to close the
                    ever-widening gap between the findings and arguments of academic historians and the general American
                    perception of the Revolution as a thoroughly harmonious and successful, almost benign, affair.
                    Although general readers will enjoy The Glorious Cause, they will be neither surprised nor
                    challenged by it.</p>

                    </placeName> State University Press, 1983. Pp. xii, 163. Illustrations, maps, notes, index.
                    Paperbound, $11.95.)</head>
            <p>Americans have always prided themselves on being an inventive and self-reliant people. The puttering
                    mechanic who stumbles upon a major discovery, the "can-do" small business man who
                    creates from a corner store a major company—these are but a few of the stock cliches of
                    our culture. H. Roger Grant's book examines this cultural image but does so within the
                    pointed context of the major depression of the 1890s. Such an approach is of historical interest
                    and, as Grant argues in his conclusion, is of considerable interest for contemporary Americans as
                    well.</p>
            <p>Grant examines five types of self-help during the 1890s: the establishment of community gardens in
                    America's cities to provide food for the unemployed; the creation of labor exchanges and
                    cooperative stores; the attempts to build farmer-owned railroads; and the efforts by a number of
                    Americans to live in cooperative communities. Considered as a descriptive vignette, the book is
                    frequently interesting and informative. The chapter on labor exchanges, for example, is in the main
                    a discussion of the career of Giovanni Battista De Bernardi, an obscure but interesting reformer. An
                    Italian immigrant who lived in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> and was influenced by the Granger movement and by Edward Bellamy, De Bernardi saw in
                    the labor exchange <pb n="272" id="VAA4025-079-3-070"/> both a source of short-term help for the
                    unemployed as well as a model for the potential restructuring of American society in general. A
                    similar point might be made of Grant's description of the career of Charles W. Caryl, a
                    businessman, inventor, and social worker who tried to establish a Utopian community in the last
                    years of the depression. In these and a few other sketches Grant's writing is direct; and,
                    within the confines of the limited documentation, he resuscitates examples of some of the
                    lesser-known reform efforts.</p>
            <p>Taken as a whole, however, the book is not very convincing. The social meaning of these experiments
                    and the interrelationship between them and other, better-known protest efforts is not clearly
                    presented. Throughout the book, for example, Grant argues that the various attempts at self-help
                    faltered with the return of prosperity; but he also argues (p. 86), following Lawrence Goodwyn, that
                    such efforts were the result not of "hard times" but rather of "insurgent
                    cultures." What then, one asks, happened to that insurgency with the ending of
                    "hard times"? What makes this interpretative confusion even odder is that Grant
                    recognizes that the only successful "farmer-owned railroad" he discovered was, in
                    reality, a <hi rend="i">de facto</hi> subsidiary of James J. Hill's Great Northern empire.
                    This realization, however, does not temper his conclusion where, against the background of the near
                    total failure of these self-help experiments, he asserts that his evidence suggests that
                    "there truly exists a way to combat powerlessness, that nameless dread" (p. 140).
                    That may well be true, but there is little evidence for such an assumption in the book.</p>

            <p>Inaugurating a new series, <hi rend="i">U.S.A. 20/21: Studies in Recent American History,</hi> this
                    volume is concerned with change, continuity, and complexity during the first decade and a half after
                    World War II. In stimulating essays fourteen historians point out that in various ways the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1960 differed <pb n="273" id="VAA4025-079-3-071"/> significantly from what it had
                    been in 1945. The demographic changes appear especially large.</p>
            <p>The range of topics illustrates how complex the American historical profession has become. There is
                    much here on social history, a major interest of contemporary historians. Thus, Robert H. Bremner
                    writes on families and children during a "familistic" period; Leila J. Rupp shows
                    that feminism survived but only as a weak movement; William H. Chafe probes the burgeoning civil
                    rights movement; and Thomas E. Williams explores the shrinking differences between rural and urban
                    life.</p>
            <p>The book also demonstrates that political history still flourishes—and in some new ways.
                    James T. Patterson's essay on poverty and welfare and Mark I. Gelfand's on cities
                    and suburbs, to cite two illustrations, are concerned with public policy. The contributions of
                    Eugene J. Watts and Kenneth M. Jones reveal historians' rising interests in "Cops
                    and Crooks" and "The Government-Science Complex." Gary W.
                    Reichard's chapter reflects the influence of <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName>, Watergate, and new views of Dwight D. Eisenhower by expressing concern about the
                    growth of presidential power during Eisenhower's and Harry S. Truman's
                    presidencies; and Bernard Sternsher, in a discussion of parties and voters, testifies to the
                    influence of political science on the present generation of political historians.</p>
            <p>Although the book does not contain an essay on foreign policy, it includes much on the Cold
                    War's large impact on American life. This impact is, in fact, one of the major themes.
                    Thus, Roland Marchand concludes: "Beset by cold war fears and organizational complexities,
                    Americans found solace in a popular culture that provided hopeful visions of an emerging
                    classlessness and vicarious compensations for a hedged-in, manipulated feeling" (p. 182),
                    and Ronald Lora writes: "Of the various factors causally significant in effecting
                    curriculum change, the cold war was the preeminent catalyst" (p. 253). John Barnard
                    presents the international conflict as a giant factor in the lives of workers and the labor
                    movement, and Arthur M. Johnson ends his positive appraisal of business in the period with a
                    suggestion that a major event in the Cold War—the launching of
                    Sputnik—"marked the end of a business-dominated era…. the partnership
                    between government and business, forged during World War II and continued at a reduced level through
                    the 1950s, tilted increasingly toward government as the senior partner, making it a major <pb n="274" id="VAA4025-079-3-072"/> source of demand and funding for private enterprise"
                    (p. 112). The book presents many similarly exciting ideas.</p>

            <p>America's Founding Fathers talked and wrote of their world mission to spread republicanism.
                    By the 1850s a new generation of American leaders was less concerned with the liberation of other
                    peoples by the spreading of republicanism than with the limitless expansion of an allegedly superior
                    American race over supposedly inferior ones. Historian Reginald Horsman's <hi rend="i">Race
                        and Manifest Destiny</hi> probes the origins of pre-Civil War American racialism and its impact
                    on the course of American expansion.</p>
            <p>In Part I Horsman demonstrates that colonial Americans inherited the myth of a free Anglo-Saxon past
                    that had been nurtured by English clergymen to justify their break with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In struggling to separate themselves from the government of Great Britain, American
                    revolutionaries generally believed that they were contending for principles of liberty introduced
                    into <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> more than a thousand years earlier by Anglo-Saxons from <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Horsman reveals in Part II how the belief that Americans were the most distinguished descendants of
                    the Anglo-Saxons grew in the decades after the Revolution and how the belief that expansion was an
                    integral part of American destiny permeated American thinking. Between 1815 and 1850 American
                    writers found the guiding principle in their nation's history in the love of liberty
                    supposedly characteristic of Germanic peoples and in the alleged innate ability of Anglo-Saxons to
                    enshrine liberty in free institutions. Outside of <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> and areas in the Old Northwest where its influence was strong, theories of
                    Teutonic-Anglo-Saxon greatness, which developed as part of the Romantic movement and the new
                    "scientific" theories of race espoused by such scholars as Samuel G. Morton,
                    provided a convenient rationale for holding blacks in bondage and mistreating Indians. Even New
                    Englanders such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, who shunned extreme racial arguments, believed in
                    "the moral peculiarity of the Saxon race" (p. 178).</p>
            <p>Part III focuses on the American Anglo-Saxon political <pb n="275" id="VAA4025-079-3-073"/> ideology
                    that rigorously excluded nonwhite races from equal participation in the American republic. Horsman
                    argues that the remarkable expansion, development, and rise to power of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> during the three quarters of a century following the American Revolution had turned the
                    republican optimism of the Founding Fathers into arrogance. Racial Anglo-Saxonism provided a
                    convenient justification for America's internal and external subjugation of
                    "inferior" peoples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Race and Manifest Destiny</hi> is a well-documented, in-depth study of antebellum racial
                    thought which challenges the older view of historians that racial Anglo-Saxonism was not
                    intellectually ascendant in American thought before the Civil War. Although Horsman acknowledges the
                    presence of "a confused minority" who did not believe "the bombast, the
                    arrogance, the shallow thought" (p. 269) of the antebellum Anglo-Saxonists, more attention
                    needs to be paid to those who refused to condemn other races to permanent inferiority. Nevertheless,
                    Horsman has made a very important contribution to the understanding of antebellum racial thought.</p>

            <p>This brief economic history of black Americans is a work of synthesis. The author relies largely on
                    relevant secondary works and government publications to chronicle the struggles of black workers.
                    The survey is leavened, however, by materials and insights drawn from the author's research
                    on A. Philip Randolph and the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.</p>
            <p>William H. Harris states that his book "is about the racism that has made it impossible for
                    blacks to participate fully in American society" (pp. 3–4). He takes his title
                    from the first half of the lament, "The harder we run, the farther we fall
                    behind." Harris demonstrates the appropriateness of both parts of this saying in describing
                    the economic experiences of black Americans since emancipation. His analysis focuses on employment
                    trends, the relationship of black workers to the trade union movement, and organized efforts by
                    blacks to change employment patterns and to fight discrimination by trade unions.</p>
            <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-079-3-074"/>
            <p>Harris begins his survey with an analysis of the efforts of the former slaves to enter the labor
                    force as free workers and of the beginning of their continuing struggle to keep from being relegated
                    to the status of a reserve labor supply. The struggle has been against employers who have exploited
                    black workers and against fellow white workers who refused to close ranks with black workers. There
                    have been periods that brought hope for improvement. Black workers achieved an actual and a symbolic
                    victory in 1925 with the organization of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Jobs in northern
                    and southern industries opened during both world wars, and black Americans shared the prosperity of
                    the Korean War years. There were also gains made in the struggle to develop class solidarity among
                    black and white workers. These advances came, in part, through the work of such organizations as the
                    NAACP and the National Urban League, through organized groups of black workers within the labor
                    movement, and through changes in governmental policies, beginning with the New Deal.</p>
            <p>Even so, as the author warns, "this is not an optimistic book" (p. 6). He finds
                    that by 1980 the "future prospects for most workers were about as bleak as they had been
                    when Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation" and that "after more than a
                    century of struggle little had been done to limit the impact of race on employment and
                    income" (pp. 188–89). Harris tells a story that is familiar to students of
                    Afro-American history, but he tells it cogently and succinctly.</p>

            <p>This anthology analyzes the careers of fifteen nationally prominent twentieth-century black leaders.
                    Although the contributors to this volume each studied a different individual, all of them, as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Meier write in their introduction, were asked "to examine the kind of role
                    played by his or her subject in the struggle for black advancement," how each
                    "functioned as a leader of blacks and—where relevant—as a mobilizer
                    of white support" (p. x). The result is a useful, but ultimately disappointing, compendium
                    of current knowledge about black leadership in the <placeName>

            <p>The essays in <hi rend="i">Black Leaders of the Twentieth Century</hi> treat <pb n="277" id="VAA4025-079-3-075"/> a variety of leaders, leadership styles, programs, and
                    strategies—individuals whose influence emanated from their organizational affiliation;
                    accommodationists, nationalists, and integrationists; persons who inspired and manipulated others
                    through their charismatic appeal; politicians, ministers, and journalists; and persons who rose to
                    prominence through business, labor, and the professions. This collection of essays is also diverse
                    in method. Most of the authors employ traditional biographical techniques, but a few use social
                    science concepts and models to illuminate the major achievements of their subjects.</p>
            <p>Inevitably, the quality of the essays varies. Among the best are Emma Lou Thornbrough's
                    "T. Thomas Fortune," Darlene Hine's contribution on the little-known
                    nurse and civil rights activist Mable K. Staupers, Genna Rae McNeil's study of lawyer and
                    legal strategist Charles H. Houston, and B. Joyce Ross's insightful "Mary McLeod
                    Bethune and the National Youth Administration." Other authors discuss the activities of
                    Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. DuBois, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Charles C. Spaulding, Marcus Garvey,
                    Whitney M. Young, Jr., A. Philip Randolph, James Weldon Johnson, Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X,
                    and Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. All the essays are well written and provide useful bibliographical
                    information for readers wanting additional information about the black leaders discussed in the
                    book.</p>
            <p>The major disappointment with this anthology is its inadequate unifying conceptual framework. In
                    their introduction <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Meier do identify some common themes, but, provocative as those few pages are, they
                    leave the reader unsatisfied. The volume needs, either at the beginning or end, a synthetic essay in
                    which the disparate contributions are put into a general context and the results of the research are
                    assessed in terms of both method and substance. If that final essay were written, it might be
                    possible to make a case for a research strategy into the history of black leadership that would
                    result in a theoretical paradigm for examining this important subject.</p>
            <p>This criticism aside, <hi rend="i">Black Leaders</hi> is a book that should be read by historians and
                    nonhistorians alike. The analysis of black leadership will be undertaken best in the way charted in
                    this collection; that is, through the compilation of case studies. Nonetheless, surely not too far
                    in the future, a systematic synthesis of existing studies should be written, if only as a framework
                    for future research.</p>

            <p>Folklorist Bruce A. Rosenberg declares that the chief purpose of his book is "to give
                    structure, order, hierarchy, and purpose to several events, individuals, and institutions of the
                    American West" (p. 1). He candidly admits that his book will offer no major new
                    understanding of the frontier experience, but by interpreting several famous western symbols he
                    hopes to explain their continuing popularity.</p>
            <p>Rosenberg's eleven chapters explore the exploits of mountain men, the dreams of prospectors,
                    the narratives of overlanders, the endurance of Mormons, the courage of George Armstrong Custer, the
                    speed of the Pony Express, the race of two <placeName>

                    </placeName> steamboats, the accomplishments of the railroaders, the infamy of the gunfighters, the
                    dream of the sensual native maiden, and the myth of the white stallion of the prairies. There is
                    often little to connect these chapters so that the book is really a collection of disparate essays.
                    Any of them could stand alone, and in fact three have been previously published in journals, while
                    the Custer chapter presents nothing not said better in Rosenberg's excellent <hi rend="i">Custer and the Epic of Defeat</hi> (1975). The chapter on the race between the steamboats <hi rend="i">Natchez</hi> and <hi rend="i">Robert E. Lee</hi> has little, if anything, to do with
                    the West at all, belonging more to southern folklore. This disjointed narrative makes it impossible
                    for the author to achieve his goal of giving order and structure to the past.</p>
            <p>The notes are quite brief, reflecting the use of a limited number of materials. The sources that are
                    used are often a strange mixture of folklore, popular culture, and academic and pop history. The
                    consistent misspelling of the names of well-known historians Sandra Myres and Robert Athearn in the
                    text and notes makes the reader wonder about how familiar the author is with these materials. The
                    depth of his research is further clouded because either he or his publisher decided against
                    including a bibliography. That is too bad, as was the decision not to include an index.</p>
            <p>Although an attractively produced book on a worthy topic by a noted scholar, <hi rend="i">Code of the
                        West</hi> ultimately promises more than it can deliver in under two hundred pages of text.
                    Rosenberg never seems to have enough space to develop his arguments. While several of his chapters
                    are interesting, even engaging, the book ultimately fails to live up to its potential.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Shadows of the Indian</hi> by Raymond William Stedman deals with an important subject.
                    In <hi rend="i">The Pretend Indians</hi> (1980), edited by Gretchen M. Bataille and Charles L.P.
                    Silet, Vine Deloria points out: "The whites are sincere but they are only sincere about
                    what they are interested in, not about Indians about whom they know very little. They get
                    exceedingly angry if you try to tell them the truth and will only reject you and keep searching
                    until they find the Indian of their fantasies" (p. xv). Stedman's <hi rend="i">Shadows of the Indian</hi> is about these fantasies.</p>
            <p>Similar to such studies as Roy Harvey Pearce's <hi rend="i">Savagism and Civilization: A
                        Study of the Indian and the American Mind</hi> (1965) and Robert F. Berkhofer's <hi rend="i">The White Man's Indian</hi> (1979), <hi rend="i">Shadows of the Indian</hi>
                    searches for white stereotypes of Indians in paintings, sermons, literature, and plays from the
                    fifteenth and sixteenth centuries to the present. Unlike Pearce and Berkhofer, however, Stedman goes
                    beyond a survey of these sources to examine contemporary modes of popular expression: movies,
                    advertisements, cartoons, paperback novels, radio, and television. The chapters—each
                    following a trajectory of images from contact to today—are divided according to theme or
                    stereotype. For example, "La Belle Sauvage" and "Men Friday" are
                    devoted to views of Indian women and men; "Indian Talk" examines linguistic
                    stereotypes; and "Lust Between the Bookends" and "You Know What They Do
                    To White Women" explore sexual images.</p>
            <p>This study of racial and cultural stereotyping of the Indian in American culture is recounted with
                    both wit and irony and makes delightful reading. Unfortunately, there is little trenchant analysis
                    of how the stereotypes functioned in the dominant culture or even how they affected Native
                    Americans. Despite this criticism, however, Stedman has in lucid prose and with excellent
                    illustrations provided an extensive catalog of Indian stereotypes, especially as perpetuated in the
                    various media over the last three decades. As an aid to the student of Indian-white relations,
                    Stedman also includes a chronology of literary and historical works on Native Americans in a brief
                    appendix. <hi rend="i">Shadows of the Indian</hi> is a useful contribution to the study of American
                    culture and to American perceptions of <hi rend="i">the Indian.</hi>

            <p>Historians have long been bewildered by or opposed to the use of objects as evidence through which to
                    interpret the past. Trained to employ documents which provide verbal descriptions, historians
                    generally have believed physical artifacts to be ambiguous and uncertain sources of information. In
                    the past two decades, however, as their attention has turned from leadership elites to the mass of
                    ordinary people, historians have begun to realize that artifacts can provide valuable insights into
                    social practices and patterns. Furthermore, objects—such as tools, toys, and buildings,
                    as well as photographs of them— are often available where written documents were never
                    created or have been lost. The historian's problem remains, however: how to extract
                    reliable information about the past from an inanimate, inarticulate object.</p>
            <p>Earlier, in a collection of his own innovative, stimulating essays, <hi rend="i">Artifacts and the
                        American Past</hi> (1980), Thomas J. Schlereth, professor of American Studies at Notre Dame
                    University, encouraged historians to use the material remains of past cultures in their research and
                    teaching. Now he has gathered together, from scattered and often obscure locations, some of the best
                    writing of the past quarter century by historians, museum curators, and others interested in
                    artifacts. This anthology, which begins with Schlereth's own essay deftly summarizing the
                    history of material culture studies over the last century, offers instructive and thought-provoking
                    discussions of the philosophy, methodology, and specific applications of artifactual study. Included
                    are pioneering and still valuable statements of theory by John Kouwenhoven, E. McClung Fleming, and
                    others and a variety of outstanding examples of artifactual analysis. Craig Gilborn's study
                    of the Coca-Cola bottle, Kenneth Ames's discussion of Victorian hall furnishings, Ruth
                    Schwartz Cowan's analysis of the advent of modern household technology and the consequences
                    for women's domestic roles, and Bruce Lohof's consideration of gas station
                    architecture are particularly rewarding.</p>
            <p>Schlereth has assembled the first real textbook for material culture studies. He has rescued from
                    obscurity fine, instructive essays such as Glen Holt's "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> through a Camera Lens: An Essay on Photography as History."
                    Schlereth's splendid introduction <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-079-3-079"/> to each of the
                    twenty-three essays provide coherence and add depth to the anthology. His helpful bibliography
                    suggests where to turn next. Unfortunately, the illustrations which would seem essential to
                    accompany discussions of artifacts are notably absent. Despite that rather serious deficiency, this
                    is the best available starting place for anyone interested in learning how to use the material past.
                    It will not erase all historians' doubts about the ambiguity and uncertainty of
                    artifactually derived information, but it effectively demonstrates the potential for material
                    culture study to complement other historical inquiry.</p>

            <p>Local history, once the exclusive domain of the amateur, has become in the last twenty years a field
                    of interest for professional historians seeking a manageable area in which to test interdisciplinary
                    hypotheses and to study non-elites. More recently, historians have begun to author "how
                    to" volumes directed at teachers, amateurs, and colleagues. <hi rend="i">Nearby
                    History</hi> is the most recent entry in this new market. Authored by knowledgeable and experienced
                    professionals who have previously collaborated, the book aims "to bring together historical
                    studies of the family, the community, and material culture" (p. ix). Instead of organizing
                    the book thematically, Kyvig and Marty emphasize the types of evidence available for research and
                    the ways in which they can be used through separate chapters on published documents, unpublished
                    sources, oral records, visual material, artifacts, and landscapes and buildings. An excellent
                    introductory chapter includes a useful list and arrangement of questions about family,
                    organizations, and community and provides a valuable source for beginning research.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, in so brief a survey, it is difficult to cover each topic thoroughly; thus, the
                    authors are forced to alternate between an introduction to the subject and a recitation of practical
                    suggestions for the novice. Such an approach might have worked better had the supporting
                    material—captioned illustrations and excerpts from different sources—been more
                    closely tied to the text. Captions frequently raise but do not answer a <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-079-3-080"/> number of questions of interpretation and analysis. The text introduces
                    the reader to various materials, their origins and preservation, but it does not provide the
                    direction most needed by the developing historian—guidance in using the materials
                    profitably. The novice is not shown how to apply deductive skills or to evaluate inferential clues
                    to reach historical insights, nor is the person who has moved beyond the elementary given sufficient
                    guidance for acquiring deeper understanding. Fewer examples, elaborated in more detail, of just how
                    historians evaluate different kinds of evidence would have given the reader a better appreciation of
                    the possibilities and limitations of nearby history.</p>
            <p>Readers of this volume should also consult other complementary publications of the American
                    Association for State and Local History, such as Thomas E. Felt's <hi rend="i">Researching,
                        Writing, and Publishing Local History</hi> (1981), H.G. Jones's <hi rend="i">Local

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Ordinary Americans</hi> is Charles Cole's own family history. The first
                    ancestor he can locate is his great-grandfather, Jacob Kohl of <placeName>

                    </placeName> (1795–1871), but the person who did more to shape later generations was
                    Kohl's son, Jacob Cole (1835–1908), who moved from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> to northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1882. The author himself was born and raised in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>. The book is filled with detailed information about collateral descendants of Jacob
                    Kohl as well as the author's own line. One sometimes loses one's way in the tangle
                    of <hi rend="i">Kinnomen;</hi> but photographs, genealogical charts, and attempts to capture
                    something of the individuality of many family members make this family history more readable than
                    most. Cole uses letters and diaries from the nineteenth century as well as oral-history
                    interviewing. When <pb n="283" id="VAA4025-079-3-081"/> short on information about his ancestors, he
                    employs secondary sources to suggest what life might have been like for them.</p>
            <p>Two things struck this reviewer. First, how brief is American history! Charles Cole's <hi rend="i">grandfather</hi> was the pioneer who began in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and crossed the plains to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>. The great events of our past are encompassed in about three or four lifetimes! Second,
                    how fragile are family bonds. Migration could easily break parent-child ties for good. Cole reprints
                    a letter from Jacob Cole's mother to Jacob after he had moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. She lists for him his various nieces and nephews; apparently he is unaware of their
                    existence back in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. Jacob "burned his bridges," as author Cole points out; frontier
                    individualism and rejection of the past often implied rejection of the family.</p>
            <p>Charles Cole's own attitude is not particularly reverential toward his family history; he
                    has the scholar's detachment. That attitude seems thoroughly in keeping with contemporary
                    culture and with the history of the Coles.</p>

                    $15.00; paperbound, $7.95.) In his preface, editor Donald C. Manlove sets
                    forth the criteria he used in choosing the pieces to be published in this book: "the poems
                    most frequently anthologized, Mr. Riley's particular favorites, and the favorites of the
                    editor" were selected with a view to producing a "balanced picture of the whole
                    range of Riley's work" (p. ix). The resulting volume admirably reflects this
                    intention. The poems which constitute the bulk of the volume are published in chronological order,
                    and they are well chosen to show the range of techniques and subjects that Riley employed during his
                    career. The last section of the book comprises three prose selections. Also included is a brief
                    biographical sketch of Riley. <hi rend="i">Gary L. Bailey, Indiana University, <placeName>
