            <p>The earliest land claims about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> rested on a reputed grant by the Indians. According to a memorial
                    to congress, filed by the inhabitants of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the Indians of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, at a council in 1742, ceded to them all the land from Point Coupes
                    to the mouth of <geogName>White river</geogName>. The record of the treaty long
                    remained with the recorder of deeds at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but at the beginning of the French and Indian War an absconding
                    officer is said to have taken the deed away with him. The petitioners claimed
                    that the Indians had often ratified this gift, afterward extending it forty
                    leagues west and thirty leagues east of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. The congressional committee rejected the claim, on the ground that
                    if there were such a grant, it had been made to the French government, and in
                    time, had passed to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

            </p>
            <p>This claim was, in a measure, at least, recognized when the deed to the Wabash
                    Land Company was made, for in that deed the land was excepted. The lines and
                    corners of this grant are known as the "Freeman Lines and
                    Corners."</p>
            <p>The "Freeman Lines and Corners" have been subjects of a great
                    deal of comment recently. They are lines run, and corners established by Thomas
                    Freeman, a surveyor, in 1802-3, when Indiana was a territory. He surveyed a
                    tract of land that was <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Companies of men who promoted enterprises, settlements, etc., were formed in the

            <p>On March 21, 1775, Governor Dunmore, of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, issued a proclamation ordering that all vacant land of His Majesty

            <p>In the year 1775, after the expedition of Lord Dunmore against the Shawnees,

                        <region type="county">Illinois Country</region>
                    </placeName>, commenced a negotiation with the Piankeshaw Indians for the
                    purchase of two large districts of country lying upon the borders of the
                        <geogName>river Wabash</geogName>. Viviat acted as agent of an association

            <p>This deed, which conveyed to the purchasers about 37,497,600 acres, was signed by
                    the Indians, attested by a number of the inhabitants at <placeName>

                    and progress of the Revolutionary War frustrated the schemes of the Wabash Land
                    Company, and prevented it from planting English settlements in the territory to
                    the possession of which they had acquired only an imperfect claim.</p>
            <p>The agents of the company applied to the American Congress <pb n="7" id="VAA4025-012-1-009"/> for a confirmation of a part of the claim, in the
                    years 1781, 1791, 1797, 1804 and 1810; but all of these applications were
                        rejected.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>That part excepted by this Indian deed and admitted to have a French, or white
                    title, has become known as the "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> Tract." It contained about 1,600,000 acres. That part of
                    it which was in Indiana had its northeast corner near Orleans. The north line of
                    this old Indian land started at Point Coupee, on the <geogName>Wabash
                    river</geogName>, about six miles below Merom, Indiana, and about 39 degrees
                    north latitude. It ran at a right angle to the main trend of the
                        <geogName>Wabash river</geogName> between Point Coupee and the mouth of
                        <geogName>White river</geogName>. That is, it ran south 78 degrees east,
                    passed near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Odon</settlement>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, and ended in Section 19, near Orleans, at what is locally
                    known as "Freeman's Corner." (This north boundary
                    line was so surveyed as to place the French settlement, at <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> Tract," in 1802-3, and placed a post at the corner not far
                    from the center of Section 19. From this corner the line ran south 12 degrees
                    west, 40 miles, through <placeName>

                    </placeName> about 7½ miles due south of the southeast corner of

                    </placeName>. In going south 12 degrees west, 40 miles, the line ran nearly
                    12½ miles west of a due south line.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> The south
                    line ran from this point, through <placeName>

                    passed near the St. Meinrad Monastery. Freeman ran both lines from the river
                    eastward. The east line he ran by going southward from the Orleans corner. He
                    turned the Orleans corner at a right angle, (90 degrees) and passed through what
                    is now Orleans, and between Paoli and Abydel, and near Eckerty, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Crawford county</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In making his survey he was required to cut out some of the underbrush, and in
                    that way opened up forest paths, which, in some places, in time, became trails
                    and finally public roads.</p>
            <p>In the Indian treaty the standard of the measurement used was the league. A

                    </placeName> and America is 18,240 feet, or almost 3½ miles. Perhaps
                    a water measurement was used because the description was based on the

                    Indians this measurement may have been employed. A land league is sometimes said
                    to be three, statute miles. It seems each country has its own length for a
                    league, and frequently one league for water, another for land, and still another
                    for mail routes, etc., so it appears very indefinite. A league is an itinerary
                    unit not in much use now. It was once used in making treaties with water courses
                    as boundaries, before surveys had been made.</p>

            <p>The American government did not recognize the title, as held by the French and
                    the Wabash Land Company, as sufficient, and proceeded to recognize the claims of
                    the Indians. The government proceeded to buy the land from the Indians direct,

                    consideration at an early date. Here is where Surveyor Freeman and the Orleans

                    concerning the corner, "very rich level land, timber very large, black
                    oak, hickory, sugar," etc." In making the survey many
                    notations were made; for example, in the survey of the south line he says he
                    started from the mouth of <geogName>White river</geogName> on Sunday. In his

                    </placeName> Tract." If the territory through which it passed were

                    severally, by their chiefs and head-men, of the other part.</p>
            <p>"Art. I. Whereas, by the fourth article of a treaty made between the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> tribe, on August 18, 1804, the said <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> engaged to consider the said Delawares as the proprietors of all
                    that tract of country which is bounded by the <geogName>White river</geogName>
                    on the north, the <placeName>

                    southwest. And whereas the Miami tribe, from whom the Delawares derived their
                    claim, contend that, in their cession of said tract to the Delawares, it was
                    never their intention to convey to them the right of the soil, but to suffer
                    them to occupy it as long as they thought proper, the said Delawares have, for
                    the sake of peace and good neighborhood, determined to relinquish their claim to
                    the said tract, and do, by these presents, release the <placeName>

            <p>"Art. III. In consideration of the cession made in the preceding
                    article, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    no longer; which, together with the sum of four thousand dollars, which is now

                    December 10, 1809, he wrote:</p>
            <p>"This small tract (of about twenty miles square) is one of the most
                    beautiful that can be conceived, and is, moreover, believed to contain a very
                    rich copper mine. I have myself, frequently seen specimens of the copper, one of
                    which I sent to Mr. Jefferson, in 1802. The Indians were so extremely jealous of
                    any search being made for this mine that the traders were always cautioned not
                    to approach the hills, which are supposed to contain the mine."<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears that the Indians had large road belts to guide them in the making of
                    these treaties, and in showing the treaty lines.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The student of the foregoing treaties will observe that the Indians received
                    better pay for the land they ceded in the treaty of September 30, 1809, than
                    they did for any other sale while Indiana was a territory. He will also observe
                    that there was a tendency of each tribe to recognize the right of some other
                    tribe to a quasi title to the land ceded. He will further observe that General
                    Harrison usually stipulated that a compensation would be paid the Indians who
                    signed, when the other tribes agreed to the treaty, etc</p>
            <p>The Indians began to see themselves losing the land, and the tribes in the
                    central and northern part of Indiana began to see white men to the south of
                    them, where once roamed warriors of their own color. The government surveyor,
                    who immediately entered the land after the treaties were signed, began to divide
                    the forests into sections ready for the land offices and settlers. Two hundred
                    and fifty thousand forest trees bearing the marks of the surveyors, tokens of
                    advancing civilization, told the Indians, in a manner not to be misunderstood,
                    that the days of the forest were numbered, and that their possessions were
                    passing away.</p>
            <p>Tecumseh was an Indian statesman, in addition to being a warrior. He contended
                    that the Indians held their land in common, and that no one tribe or family
                    could properly convey a part of the Indian territory to the whites. He
                    endeavored to have the Indians unite and to consider their lands as the common
                    property of the whole. He accused General Harrison of taking tribes aside, and
                    advising them not to unite or enter into Tecumseh's Confederacy.

                    </placeName> Tract." The treaty line is known as the Freeman Line. It
                    enters Dubois county about two and one-fourth miles north of the southwest
                    corner of the county, runs south 78 degrees east [1802], and leaves the county a
                    mile west of the southeast corner of Cass township. The line runs through Dubois
                    county a distance of 7.35 miles, and covers a meridian distance of seven miles.
                    The land north of this line is said to have been sold by Indians at a council at <placeName>

            <p>The candidates on the State ticket filled long schedules of joint poltical
                    meetings in all parts of the State and from early in the spring until a short
                    time before the election. Messrs. Wright and McCarty, candidates for governor,
                    and Messrs. Willard and Williams, candidates for lieutenant-governor, and others
                    of the leading office-seekers had extended itineraries during most of the
                    campaign. The newspapers seldom reported in full any of the speeches, but always
                    commented on them. A great part was taken in the campaign by the editors who
                    waged an incessant warfare against their political opponents, always seeking to
                    embroil in the general conflict any man who showed signs of fight. One side
                    endeavored to put the other in a hole by digging up some particularly unsavory
                    act in a candidate's past record.</p>
            <p>In the campaign of 1852, as in nearly every State campaign since, the candidates
                    pleaded the "farmer" story, pretending a great love and
                    affection for and interest in that body of the citizenship, in order to get the
                    farmers' votes. The leading newspapers of each party engaged, during
                    the campaign, in a controversy as to the early life of their candidates for
                    governor, each trying to make out the strongest case for its own man that he was
                    or had been a farmer, and thus making him eminently qualified to represent the
                    interests of the farmers. This was a necessary qualification for a good
                    candidate for governor. The truth in this case was that neither Wright nor
                    McCarty had ever been a farmer long enough to get the name. McCarty had worked a
                    few months when a young man, while Wright's only claim lay in the
                    fact that he had been a mechanic who worked on farming implements. The fact that
                    while he was governor, he had spoken at several agricultural meetings and at
                    various county fairs, appeared to give the governor the strongest case.</p>

                    Daily from March 1 until election day, it gave prominence in its columns to the
                    following words, which Governor Wright had uttered at the time of the State
                    Convention:</p>
            <p>"Whigs! Remember that Joseph A. Wright emphatically twice
                    declared, on accepting the nomination of the Democratic Convention, that
                    'he had rather fall with his political friends than rise with the aid
                    of his political opponents.' "<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Democratic press answered this by saying that the <hi rend="i">State
                    Journal</hi> inserted the words "the aid of," that Governor
                    Wright did not say them; and further, that what he meant was that "he
                    would rather fall fighting with his friends for his cherished principles, than
                    rise with his opponents, by the sacrifice of any of those
                        principles."<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Whig papers were not in the least averse to going into Governor
                    Wright's past record to gather utterances of his which might be
                    converted to useful campaign ammunition. The <hi rend="i">State Journal</hi> and

                    </placeName> in 1851, during the heat of the slavery agitation, in which he had
                    said that "all the members of Congress from Indiana, who supported the
                    compromise measures, had misrepresented their constituents and would be defeated
                    if they were candidates for re-election" and "that Indiana
                    would never execute the fugitive slave law." At this time, in 1852,
                    Governor Wright and his party stood for that measure, and now the Whig press was
                    calling upon him to explain the inconsistency of his attitude. Governor Wright
                    was never strong pro-slavery, rather he was more of a Free Soiler. His views as
                    he expressed them on that occasion, are explainable when it is remembered that
                    he expressed the real sentiments of most Indianians at that time when the free
                    men's passions were inflamed by the slavery agitation. The governor
                    was no more inconsistent than many of the Whigs.</p>
            <p>The Democratic press refrained from attacking Mr. McCarty to any extent. It may
                    have been because he was commonly recognized as a weak candidate. His career as

            <p>The death of Henry Clay on June 29, 1852, gave the Whig press cause for another
                    sally against Governor Wright's record. This time an attempt was made

                    of villification in the following words:</p>
            <p>"Among all the lean, gaunt, and vindictive blood-hounds, that were ever
                    unleashed from the kennel of Locofocoism, and for years pursued Mr. Olay with
                    slander and detraction, Joseph A. Wright was among the foremost. In 1844, he
                    denounced Mr. Olay as a blackleg, a Sabbath-breaker, and a murderer, declaring
                    with most sanctimonious face, and with up-turned eyes, that the
                    'blood of poor Cilley (killed in a duel) was upon his
                    hands.' "<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

            <p>The <hi rend="i">State Sentinel</hi> replied that the above article in its length
                    and breadth, was wilfully and maliciously false, and that John D. De-frees, the
                    author, knew it was false when he uttered and published it; that the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> men were soulless villifiers, by whose policy of
                    blackguardism it would never allow itself to be driven from position. These
                    editorials were mere newspaper squabble and had little influence on the voters.
                    The editor of the <hi rend="i">State Journal</hi> was more eager to break down
                    the Democrats than to work for the election of General Scott and the Whig

                    student at Indiana University, where, during his attendance, he acted as janitor
                    and doorkeeper at that institution, earning, by chopping wood and other services

                    that the President of the Board of Trustees of Indiana University was the
                    authority for the statement about Wright.</p>
            <p>Governor Wright entered the campaign early in April. He usually spoke on some
                    phase of State finances, occasionally changing<hi rend="sup">1</hi> to the
                    tariff and the subtreasury system when he wished to speak on national issues. He
                    claimed for the Democrats the credit for the redemption of the State from Whig
                    indebtedness and he never failed to extol the wisdom of the sale of the
                    State's interest in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

                    </placeName> Railway, a deal which seems to have been engineered by politicians
                    in both parties. The reduction of the State debt which in 1843, following the
                    financial stringency, amounted to near $15,000,000, which he had
                    reduced by one-half– by repudiation, some said–was one of
                    Governor Wright's main sources of campaign argument. In a speech made
                    on one of the joint tours with McCarty, he said: "What is now the
                    condition of the State ? About one-half of the State debt discharged, and the
                    interest on the balance promptly paid. The credit of the State is good at home
                    and abroad; and the sun rises this day upon a million of her children prosperous
                    and happy. Are not these things so? And by whose policy has this change been
                    produced? There is no man in Indiana, who knows her history but that will, in
                    the honest conviction of his heart, say it was the Democratic policy that has
                    redeemed our fallen State."<hi rend="sup">44</hi> About one-half of the
                    State debt was cancelled by the Butler Bill of 1846 and its amendment of 1847,
                    according to which the old canal was given to the bondholders for one-half of
                    the bonds.</p>
            <p>Nicholas McCarty had been a merchant most of his life and therefore was not very
                    well versed in the arts and tricks of the political campaigning. He was a plain,
                    unassuming man, so plain, in fact, that he never made a hit with his audience by
                    displaying his oratorical powers. McCarty's lack of experience in the
                    art of stump-speaking was well-known to most people, including the Democratic
                    press. The statement issued by McCarty after the Whig State Convention that he

                    paper said:</p>
            <p>"It is understood that Mr. McCarty will remain at home throughout the
                    entire campaign, being a little timorous about meeting Wright on the stump.
                    That's a sensible arrangement on his part. For him to canvass the
                    State in opposition to Jo. Wright would be only time and money thrown away, and
                    it seems he knows it."<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Expressions of this kind by the opposition served to draw Mr. McCarty from his

                    portions of the State, renders it necessary for him to resign."</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Indiana State Journal,</hi> throughout the campaign, manifested
                    great confidence that the elections would result favorably to the Whigs. Soon
                    after the opening of the State campaign, it expressed its confidence in the
                    following words:</p>
            <p>"There never has been a time in Indiana, since 1840, that the Whigs felt
                    more confident of success than now. Since the news of the nominations made by
                    the Whig Convention has reached the various parts of the State, we have received
                    many letters of the most encouraging character. In every neighborhood the right
                    kind of spirit to secure victory seems to pervade the Whig ranks."<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Whigs tried to make their prospects look a little more rosy by putting out
                    rumors to the effect that many Democrats of Northern Indiana were so much
                    displeased with the ticket composed mostly of Democrats from Southern Indiana
                    that they would refuse to support it. The threat, if it was made, does not seem
                    to have been carried out.</p>
            <p>The Whigs and Democrats in many places in the State held jollification meetings
                    following the news of their Presidential nominations, and at other times during
                    the campaign. The press, in the period from April to November, carried an almost
                    daily account of a ratification meeting or pole-raising somewhere in the State.
                    Guns, bonfires, cannon and fire works were a few of the means to which the

                    newspapers of one party, in reporting an account of the meetings of the other
                    party, always emphasized the poor attendance and conduct. On the other hand,
                    when their own party held a meeting, the newspaper account dwells long on the
                    enormous crowds that swarmed to hear the speaker, the number always taxing the
                    capacity of the halls or grounds, and the great enthusiasm of everyone. A
                    Democratic political meeting at Edin-burg, on September 9, which was addressed
                    by Thomas A. Hendricks, candidate for Congress, was reported by the Whig papers
                    as having been postponed once because of the small audience, and when it did
                    take place, there were only thirteen men and boys present. "About
                    fifteen men and boys" was a favorite number with the Whig press when
                    reporting Democratic meetings. The Democratic press was equally guilty of this
                    practice. The papers frequently gave the speeches bitter and sarcastic
                        criticisms.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In many instances, there were attempts, sometimes successful, made by rowdies of
                    one party to disturb and to break up the political meetings of the other party.
                    The practice was general and there were several cases of it in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    the accusation, probably because he considered it as one of the legitimate
                    tricks of the game. A great many voters of both parties had little interest in

            <p>The national campaign may be said to have opened soon after the national

                    deficiency, the <hi rend="i">State Journal</hi> continued:</p>
            <p>"The great lack of enthusiasm among the Democrats for their candidates
                    is occasioned by their obscurity in public life. Few people anywhere, including

            <p>The Whig newspapers of the State took great delight in the many mistakes which
                    the Democrats made in reporting the name of their Presidential candidate. Lists
                    of these errors were run in the Whig papers. Many of the names were given by the
                    editors of the country newspapers who, not knowing the real name, made one of
                    their own. Also, the Whigs invented some of the names for their own use. The <hi rend="i">State Journal</hi> conducted an unrelenting editorial attack
                    against General Pierce up until the very day of the election. It did almost
                    everything possible to belittle and heap ridicule upon the Democratic candidate.
                    It made light of Pierce's war record, saying that:</p>
            <p>"Next to making a 'whistle out of a pig's
                    ear' the attempt at manufacturing Franklin Pierce, Attorney and
                    Counselor at Law and Solicitor in Chancery, into a military hero, is the most
                    provoking."</p>
            <p>The Whigs worked hard to make capital of the fact that the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nhu">New Hampshire</region>
                    </placeName> constitution excluded Catholics from holding office and General
                    Pierce was a member of the convention that drafted the constitution. They
                    contended that the Democrats controlled the state and made the law; therefore
                    that in the convention they were against the Catholics. General Pierce was in
                    the convention, but there was plenty of proof to show that he opposed the
                    provision relating to Catholic exclusion. In their turn, the Democrats often
                    accused Scott of being a Catholic and a Catholic sympathizer, therefore the
                    Native Whigs could not support him, nor could the Know-Nothings. This accusation
                    was not well founded, as General Scott was an Episcopalian.</p>
            <p>The Indiana Whigs began the national campaign by organizing Chippewa Clubs all
                    over the State. The <hi rend="i">Indiana State Journal</hi> endorsed the idea of
                    closer organization. These clubs usually conducted the Whig rallies and
                    pole-raisings.</p>
            <p>On July 1st, the Whigs of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> had a great ratification meeting to endorse the nomination of the
                    Whig National Convention. Resolutions were adopted which gave approval for the
                    Scott and Graham nominations; for Fillmore's conduct in office and
                    his good service; and expressing sorrow at the death of Henry Clay, an event
                    which the <hi rend="i">Indiana State Journal</hi> called "a great
                    national calamity, as creating a void in the councils of our country that can
                    not be filled." Col. Henry S. Lane, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery county</region>
                    </placeName>, made the main address. The Whigs declared that they had flourished
                        <pb n="42" id="VAA4025-012-1-044"/> in 1840 on Hard Cider; in 1852 they
                    would meet with equal success on Scott Soup and Graham Bread. On this occasion
                    they raised a tall, thin pole bearing a Scott banner, but the pole soon broke,
                    the event causing much amusement for the <hi rend="i">State Sentinel.</hi> The
                        <hi rend="i">State-Journal</hi> retorted that "any sapling will
                    bear up the Pierce flag, for it is a name of no weight; but it takes something
                    of a pole to float the great name of General Scott. Common timber
                    won't do it." Music for the ratification meeting was
                    furnished by the Chippewa Glee Club of the city.</p>
            <p>The Whigs worked hard to make the tariff the leading issue of the campaign. While
                    the Democrats were busy telling the voters the beneficent effects which the
                    country was enjoying under the equitable Walker Tariff of 1846, they were
                    engaged in reciting the iniquities of such half-hearted protection and loudly
                    declared that the ruination of American industries was speedily being brought
                    about. The <hi rend="i">Indiana State Journal</hi> carried a series of articles
                    on tariff and protection which were intended to show the ill-effects of the
                    Walker Tariff for revenue of 1846. They laid great emphasis on the decrease in
                    foreign exportation and attendant increase in the amount of imports and the bad
                    business conditions. They deplored the large shipments of specie sent from this
                    country to Europe. This series of articles was signed by Americus of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, but the author was most likely O. H. Smith.</p>
            <p>In the tariff controversy carried on during the campaign, the Whigs, in order to
                    cite Democratic authority in the justification of protection, resurrected the
                    old "Coleman letter," which General Jackson had written to
                    Governor Ray, of Indiana, during his first administration. In this letter
                    General Jackson had said that he favored a "judicious
                    protection." The <hi rend="i">State Journal</hi> professed to believe
                    and labored vigorously to make the voters believe that the Democrats, by free
                    trade or low tariff, were sacrificing the American manufactures to the English
                    merchants. It went so far as to declare that there was an alliance between the
                    Locofoco party in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and the English merchants, to break down American manufactures and
                    thus secure the market for <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. The <hi rend="i">State Journal</hi> published items from three <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> papers purporting to show English preference for
                    Pierce's success, though the truth was those papers expressed general
                    indifference to the American election and stated that in event of General
                    Pierce's success, the Democrats would continue to conduct commercial
                    relations on the principle of <pb n="43" id="VAA4025-012-1-045"/> trade
                    co-operation. The Whigs used this as another ruse to arouse opposition to the
                    Democrats among the Irish by declaring that the Democracy was allied with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> through free trade, which would not be for the welfare of Irishmen.</p>
            <p>As the campaign was drawing to a close, the papers of both parties began to
                    publish long lists of the names of voters who were not going to support their
                    party nominees. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> was the most notorious offender along this line. Many
                    days its lists of "come-outers" from the Democratic party
                    became so extensive that they were obliged to shorten the number for lack of
                    space to print the names and frequently the <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> editor
                    would insert a statement to the effect that certain news items were postponed
                    until the following day in order that in the issue at hand there might be space
                    to publish the names of the Democrats who were flocking to support General
                    Scott. The Democratic press was also guilty of using this method."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Those voters who went from one party to the other were
                    generally known as "backfirers,"
                    "come-outers," and their act was called "firing in
                    the rear."</p>
            <p>On September 11, the Democrats of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> had a grand rally with Judge Stephen A. Douglas, U. S. Senator from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, as the chief orator of the day. Previous to the meeting, the
                    Granite Clubs of the city, with most of the Democrats, had a procession which
                    the <hi rend="i">Indiana State Journal</hi> reported as consisting of two
                    carriages, and one buggy, the military company and just thirty-nine other
                    persons, all told. The <hi rend="i">State Journal</hi> severely criticized Judge
                    Douglas's speech and thereby aroused the ire of William J. Brown, the
                    editor of the <hi rend="i">Sentinel.</hi> A few days later he flung a hot shot
                    of the following calibre into the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> camp:</p>
            <p>"The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> persists in its scurrilous abuse of Judge

                    perfectly self-satisfactory, we are much mistaken if the correct taste and. good
                    sense of the decent portion of the Whig party is not outraged by such

            <p>Both parties made use to the fullest advantage of the war records of their
                    candidates. The Democrats attacked General Scott for what they called his
                    unjustifiable conduct in both the War of 1812 and the Mexican War. They even
                    figured up the total amount of his salary which he had drawn from the government
                    during forty years of service, and then they raised the howl for economy. The
                    Whigs made light of Pierce's military record in Mexico, declaring
                    that he fainted in battle at the sight of blood from a wound inflicted by
                    falling from his horse. The Whigs thought that General Scott's long
                    faithful and patriotic services to his country were in themselves, sufficient
                    qualifications to fit him for the Presidency. His dealings with foreign-born
                    citizens had been so extensive and varied, and his attitude on the period of
                    naturalization required of immigrants had been so changeable that he was obliged
                    to explain his position on the subject of naturalization in order to prevent the
                    Democrats from making effective appeals to the foreign-born vote by circulating
                    false stories as to his belief. Webster had few if any supporters in Indiana, or
                    even the West; his strength was in the East. The defection of the Webster
                    faction from the Whig regular ticket was denied by the Whig press of Indiana,
                    but the papers from time to time, contained bitter expressions regarding
                    Webster's attitude. His seventh of March speech had cost him the
                    respect of most Northern Whigs.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> Webster at no time was out
                    of harmony with the <placeName>

                    </placeName> platform, but Whig leaders would not be reconciled because of his
                    past acts and his refusal to participate in the campaign now. Even when news of
                    Webster's death, on October 24, reached this State, the leading Whig
                    papers of Indiana failed to show his memory the usual respect by wearing
                    mourning, and they gave very little notice concerning his death. In contrast,
                    the Democratic press accorded the noted statesman the customary respect of an
                    opposition press, and the <placeName>

                    betray the true state of affairs within the Whig party.</p>

            <p>The returns for the election came in very slowly from the outlying parts of the
                    State. By October 14, sufficient news as to the general trend had been received
                    by the <hi rend="i">Indiana State Journal</hi> to bring it to the point of
                    reluctantly admitting defeat. The <hi rend="i">State Journal</hi> had never had
                    any great hopes that McCarty would be elected, as it admitted a few weeks before
                    the election that it hardly expected McCarty to win, but was counting strongly
                    on Scott to triumph. In the eleven congressional districts of the State, only
                    one Whig was elected, the others being Democrats. These men were to take office
                    in the first session of Congress in 1853. The last congressional election had
                    been held in August, 1851, the men elected serving until the first session of
                    1853. This election was held according to the regulations of the old State
                    constitution which became ineffective after 1851. The successful candidates in
                    October, 1852, were as follows:</p>
            <p>First District, Smith Miller; Second District, W. H. English; Third District,
                    Cyrus L. Dunham; Fourth District, James H. Lane; Fifth District, Samuel W.
                    Parker (Whig); Sixth District, Thomas A. Hendricks; Seventh District, John G.
                    Davis; Eighth District, Daniel Mace; Ninth District, Norman Eddy; Tenth
                    District, E. M. Chamberlain; Eleventh District, Andrew J. Harlan.
                    Total–Democrats, 10; Whigs, 1.</p>
            <p>The other State election returns are included in the same table with those of the
                    National election. The <hi rend="i">Indiana State Journal</hi> ascribed this
                    decisive defeat of its State ticket to the large numbers of foreigners in
                    Indiana who voted the Democratic ticket, having been let in under the new
                    Democratic State constitution of 1851.</p>

                        in place of the regular candidate. Tickets so altered and distributed
                        indiscriminately without notice might carry the intent to defraud, but

                    of knowing that all the better portion of our citizens voted the Whig ticket. If
                    this view of the case affords him consolation, it would be cruel to disturb him

            <p>The State election had scarcely passed by and the returns were not all in when
                    the day of the National election approached. It was November 2. Indiana and even
                    the whole Union appeared to have lost interest in the outcome. The voters were
                    aware that an election was at hand, but they failed to manifest much
                    understanding of the significance of the event. The political horizon was dimmed
                    by few signs of an approaching tempest, few traces of the terrible breakers.
                    There seemed nothing but a clear sky with all signs propitious to an era of
                    peace and industrial development. There was scarcely a breath of political
                    agitation, of any importance, stirring; everywhere was the calm, so quiet and
                    oppressive that, only to the more discerning eye, it was evident that it could
                    not long continue. Voters acquiesced with sullen silence in the conditions then
                    existing and voted to continue such conditions. The Democrats solemnly declared
                    the accomplishment of peace and prosperity to depend on the universal
                    acquiescence in and recognition of the "finality"; for the
                    Whigs, it all depended on the success of their party at the polls. The following

            <p>There is no doubt that the issue of "finality" did not
                    influence some sections of the country, but it is true that there was somewhat
                    of a scramble for office. The <hi rend="i">State Journal,</hi> on election day,
                    recounted at considerable length the dire disasters which would befall the
                    nation, in event of their opponents' triumph. It said:</p>
            <p>"The result of the election today is of vast consequence to the future
                    of this country. The triumph of the Democracy would see the destruction of the
                    little protection now existing. Then would the spirit of conquest and
                    lawlessness be fostered and encouraged until our country would be involved in

            <p>When the result was commonly known as a Democratic triumph, the Whig papers began
                    their work as "calamity howlers," each for its own community
                    predicting great evils to come upon the nation during the next administration.
                    The <hi rend="i">Indiana State Journal</hi> started out two days after the
                    election with the following:</p>
            <p>"The forcible extension of slavery and the formation of a batch of slave
                    States will again unchain the spirit of disunion and civil war. Such will be the
                    legitimate result of the late election, and we say–let it
                    come! We want to see the writhing of those who will have thus brought
                    upon the country so terrible a scourge."</p>
            <p>The editor was partly correct in his prediction.</p>
            <p>The Democrats celebrated their victory in such a half-hearted manner that the
                    Whigs expressed disappointment. The Democrats were neither surprised nor
                    gratified at their success. They expected to carry the elections but probably
                    never dreamed of the magnitude of their victory, which, great as it was, failed
                    to arouse the old-time enthusiasm.</p>
            <pb n="51" id="VAA4025-012-1-053"/>
            <p>The election had resulted in a sweeping defeat of the Whig <hi rend="i">forces.
                        The seriousness of the disaster was not immediately apparent,</hi> although
                    some of the wise men in the party, like Greeley, and a few Democratic editors
                    pretended to see the total dissolutiton of the Whig party at hand. The <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Daily Ledger</hi> was one of the Democratic papers which firmly
                    believed that the Whig party had been killed and now would be superseded by a
                    new party, the Seward-Abolition party. On November 16, the <hi rend="i">Daily
                        Ledger</hi> carried the following article on the future of the Whig party,

            <p>"General Scott is overwhelmingly defeated, and the Whig party not merely
                    discomfited but annihilated. We have no prophetic ken, and make no pretensions
                    to reading the future; but we do not see how the Whig party as such can ever be
                    rallied again. Defeat is but accidental, to which any party may be subjected;
                    but a defeat based on comprehensive, systematic treachery, like that just
                    experienced (through Fillmore and Webster), can hardly be other than
                    conclusive."</p>
            <p>After considering the effect which the election did have on the Whig party, the
                    only conclusion is that Horace Greeley was right in his belief.</p>

            <p>Democracy's triumph in 1852 was nothing more than a barren victory.
                    The battle in Indiana had been fought listlessly and with little popular
                    interest. Although there had been occasions when enthusiasm was displayed, yet
                    the political meetings had lacked the life and spirit of the preceding
                    campaigns. The spirit of a political campaign depends almost wholly upon the
                    interest aroused in the issues. In this campaign the issues no longer deserved
                    the name; they were dead, notwithstanding the efforts of the politicians to
                    inject life into the "finality" question. The politicians
                    fought over the carrion of extinct political questions; they fought for the
                    offices, for there was little else at stake. Office was the real issue, and its
                    cause was championed by Democrats and Whigs alike. Victory meant no triumph of
                    political principles; instead, it carried with it this time only jobs for so
                    many hungry aspirants. Voters went to the polls because they had to discharge a
                    citizens' duty, not with the belief that their vote was needed to
                    help onward some all-important issue.</p>
            <p>The result of the elections this year, favorable as they were to the Democrats,
                    was not an indication or proof that the Democrats <pb n="52" id="VAA4025-012-1-054"/> had made a glorious, aggressive fight against a
                    worthy and valian foe. The Democrats appeared to be united, but the Free Soil
                    element of the party stayed away from the polls. The Whigs had hat to fight
                    disunion and sedition within their own ranks during the campaign, so they were
                    in no condition to win from the Democrats hosts already strongly intrenched in
                    the State offices and backed be well-organized party machinery. Occasionally
                    there were heard, ir those days, the complaints of the party masses against the
                    bad practices of the machine politicians who were the men that forced the
                    compromise legislation upon the people. The Democratic leaders were very
                    successful in bringing their followers to believe that
                    "finality" of the compromise legislation was absolutely
                    necessary to the continued existence of the Union. Many Democrats considered
                    that they were performing a patriotic service by voting to keep in office the
                    political leaders who had enacted the compromise measures two years before.
                    Others in this party were uninfluenced by the plea of the politicians. It is
                    impossible to know what might have happened if there had been no general
                    acquiescence in the finality; civil war then, instead of a decade later, might
                    have resulted.</p>
            <p>The campaign and election of 1852 marked the last important contest by the Whigs.
                    The Jacksonian Democracy, likewise, made its final stand at this same time.
                    Hereafter the Free Soil men, the Conscience Whigs and the Jacksonian Democrats
                    were to be found fighting together for a common cause. Two short years
                    intervened until a new political organization arose from the ashes of the old
                    Whig party, a new organization which included almost all the leading Democratic
                    editors of Indiana in its ranks. That element of Indiana Democracy, in the
                    Northern part of the State, which complained because they were accorded such
                    slight recognition in the selection of the Democratic State ticket, was ready to
                    shift its support to any party that would treat it fairly. And that element of
                    the Whig party which believed that its rights had been violated and its protests
                    stifled by the Whig politicians during the Slavery controversy, gladly welcomed
                    the opportunity for the political freedom offered by the new party. By the time
                    another National election was at hand, these various elements were fighting side
                    by side under the common banner of Republicanism. The most significant result of
                    the election of 1852 was that it laid the foundations of a new political
                    organization, the Republican party.</p>

                    entirely on his own resources; which, however, were sufficient. By farming and
                    lumbering he acquired a handsome property. He joined the Revolutionary army

            <p>The following paragraph from a private letter written by a granddaughter of

            <p>
                    <text>
                  <body>
                     <div type="letter">
                        <p>"Our grandfather was a man of a good deal of energy and
                                    independence of character, with great firmness and tenacity of
                                    purpose. Of course, this made an enterprising man. Such he was.
                                    His business extended over much of <placeName>

                                    a most genial companion, and not wanting in the little comities
                                    of life. Now, if you have known in any of his descendants, a
                                    something of the severe (not sour or morose, hardly indeed
                                    severe) with an apparent determination not to be driven to talk,
                                    and an ability to confer with one's self,
                                    notwithstanding surroundings, added to all a sarcasm seldom
                                    used, but always ready and keen as 'Damascene
                                    blade,' making the flesh to quiver at the thought of
                                    it, I say when you find these traits, it is their inheritance
                                    from Abigail Eaton, the wife of Samuel Merrill, a woman of great
                                    excellence of character and propriety of manner, of whom all the
                                    world were ready to aver that she never uttered a wrong or
                                    useless word. <pb n="54" id="VAA4025-012-1-056"/> Is it to be

            <p>These nine rugged sons were accustomed to steady labor, and were sometimes
                    subjected to severe hardships in rafting and boating wood and ship timber on the
                        <geogName>Merrimack river</geogName>. None of them formed bad habits. The
                    oldest children, Jesse was the second, received but a limited education. Jesse
                    Merrill married Priscilla Kimball, and took her immediately to a new farm he had
                    begun making in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Peacham</settlement>

                    held at different times numerous town offices, and was four years a member of
                    the <placeName>

                    </placeName> legislature. Both he and his wife took great pains to supply their
                    want of early education, and to gratify in their children a stronger than
                    ordinary love of knowledge. Mrs. Merrill was in all the relations of life noble
                    and excellent. In their love and admiration of her, her children were
                    enthusiasts. When in after life they instructed their own daughters, they
                    illustrated their idea of womanhood by the tender, generous and just character
                    of their mother.</p>
            <p>For forty years Peacham was happy in one minister, and that one a good and great
                    man, the Rev. Leonard Worcester. The town was fortunate also in its academy,
                    celebrated for many years among the good schools of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New England</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Under the influence of Mr. Worcester, whose preaching everybody
                    attended, and of the excellent teachers in the academy, seven Merrill children,
                    six boys and one girl, grew to maturity. James was the eldest son, Samuel the
                    second. The two brothers went to school together, read the same books, and
                    continually talked over together what they heard and read. The encouragement
                    they thus gave each other was such that when rewards for excelling at school
                    were proposed, neither of them ever failed. When the boys were respectively ten
                    and seven years old, it was proposed that all the scholars in the academy, who
                    by a particular day could not be caught in Webster's spelling book,
                    should be entitled to a picture book. On the arrival of the day, the boys and
                    girls, about one hundred in number, were placed on the outside seats of a large
                    room to change their places to the center of the room as they missed. Among
                    seven, who held out to the last, the two youngest were James and Samuel. The
                    influences of the prizes they then won were not lost on either <pb n="55" id="VAA4025-012-1-057"/> of them. Confidence that they could succeed enabled
                    them to succeed,</p>
            <p>At the beginning of 1800 the attention of the whole. civilized world was fixed
                    upon the career of Napoleon. "Peacham corner" had an interest
                    scarcely less keen and vivid than that of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>. News came from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> once a week, the stage arriving at eight or nine in the evening. On
                    mail day the two boys, after the farm work, which was no light matter, would
                    plod through the darkness, nearly two miles to the postoffice, feeling
                    themselves amply rewarded as they carried home the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>

                    acquired an accurate knowledge of Josephus and other books of like character
                    that formed their father's small library.</p>
            <p>From the academy, James and Samuel entered Dartmouth College. After graduating,
                    the elder left to teach school and study law in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">York</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the younger joining him the next year, 1813. The school employed
                    besides the two brothers, Thaddeus Stevens and John Blanchard, also from Peacham
                    and from Dartmouth, and also students of law. The friendship of these young men,
                    formed in boyhood, continued through life. A year or two before the death of
                    Thaddeus Stevens, in that memorable winter, when the feeble but fierce old man
                    seemd to cling to life but to denounce dishonest and half-hearted measures and
                    cut right and left with the double-edged sword of his satire, a visitor to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> referred in his presence to the friend of his youth, Samuel
                    Merrill. The old man in a breaking voice, but still mindful of the present,
                    exclaimed, "Ah, why is it that he is dead! Why should
                    heaven, already thronged with the pure and noble, rob us of one so needed
                    here!"</p>
            <p>After three years in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">York</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Mr. Merrill came to Indiana, and, looking first at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, determined to settle in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He found it impossible to get a conveyance from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and he bought a boat, and putting in it his trunk and a number of
                    law books, he rowed himself seventy miles up the river to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was then twenty-four years old. To the last week of his life he
                    retained this vigorous self-reliance. When he was fifty-seven he rowed an equal
                    distance with one assistant, in an open boat on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, carrying the drowned and coffined body of a little <pb n="56" id="VAA4025-012-1-058"/> grandson from the woods near <placeName>

                    </placeName>, where it had been buried by strangers.</p>
            <p>Within a year from the time he began to practice law, Mr. Merrill married Lydia
                    Jane Anderson, the daughter of a widow in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>It is not a little singular in the history of Samuel Merrill, of the two brothers
                    next younger than he, and of his elder brother, that none of them for near ten
                    years after they commenced professional life did anything more than to pave the
                    way for future operations. If they had used spirits even moderately it is not
                    unlikely that the small sums required for this would have interfered materially
                    with their ultimate success, and Mr. Merrill was confident that if he had used
                    tobacco, the seed of future prosperity would either never have been planted or
                    would have failed to come to perfection. Mr. Merrill represented <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland county</region>
                    </placeName> two years in the legislature, then in session at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Corydon</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Iti 1825 he became state treasurer and removed to Corydon. The
                    intelligence of his son's election to the office of treasurer
                    prompted the following paragraph in one of his father's letters:
                    "If you don't honor the office, it will not honor you.
                    Remember that he that rises must fall. While you are going up, prepare for
                    retreat, not as the unjust steward did, but by being honest to your trust. He
                    that depends on the flatteries of the world must know that the flatterer will
                    turn against him when it suits his turn." The old Yankee farmer was
                    most concerned that his son should be honest. And the son was honest. It was
                    said of him, thirty years after the date of this letter, that "red hot
                    balls would have been as tolerable to his palms as the smallest coin that he
                    believed another's."</p>
            <p>In November, 1824, Mr. Merrill removed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He held the office of treasurer until in 1834 he was elected
                    president of the State Bank of Indiana. In this office he remained until in 1844
                    he was made president of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> &amp; <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Railroad Company, which position he held four years. In the period
                    of comparative leisure which followed, he compiled with great industry and
                    research the <hi rend="i">Indiana Gazetteer</hi>, a third edition of ten
                    thousand copies of which was published in 1850.</p>
            <p>His beloved wife died in 1847. His second wife was Elizabeth D. Young, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, previously of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chambersburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>

            <pb n="57" id="VAA4025-012-1-059"/>
            <p>In 1850 he bought out Hood &amp; Noble's book store, and united
                    with it the business of publisher. Not feeling satisfied with the <hi rend="i">Gazetteer</hi>, he meditated a thorough revision of the work. But, after a
                    week's illness, in the midst of his activity, he died. He had but a
                    short time before in conversation expressed the wish that if it accorded with
                    the will of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> he might die before old age sapped his energies.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Merrill was a man of superior abilities and attainments. His
                    judgment was sound, his perceptions clear, and his memory retentive. Probably no
                    man could tell so many incidents and anecdotes illustrative of the early history
                    of the state, or could have woven his knowledge into a more interesting or
                    instructive narrative. Though never eminent as a speaker, his clearness and
                    decision made him a valuable councillor and useful officer."</p>
            <p>His life was exceedingly laborious. While president of the State Bank, he visited
                    twice a year, never once omitting the duty, every bank in the state, giving
                    careful personal examinations to accounts and ledgers. (He could run over
                    columns of figures with a machine-like rapidity and accuracy.) He usually made
                    his journeys on horseback, often through roads indescribably bad, and though a
                    most humane man to animals, several horses were sacrificed to the terrible roads
                    and the necessity of speed. When he travelled in the stage his good humor, his
                    fund of anecdote, the flow of thought, playful or serious, furnished by his
                    richly stored mind, shortened to his fellow passengers the hours of dreary
                    dragging through swampy woods. Not only his powers of conversation were at the
                    service of strangers. He used to declare that nobody knew how to travel in this
                    country who could not walk and carry a rail; and his rail often served a whole
                    company. Once he walked all night long, nineteen miles, carrying a lantern
                    before the stage, on the horrible old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> road, reaching home just at daylight.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Merrill took up the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Railroad when it was languishing near Vernon, and accomplished more
                    in track laying in two years than had been done in ten years before, bringing
                    the road into <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and starting in its career of railroad importance the city that he
                    had named when a legislator in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Corydon</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and to which he had brought the archives and given its original
                    importance when treasurer of state."</p>
            <p>His careful attention to details may be illustrated by his action <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-012-1-060"/> during one of those spring floods that sometimes
                    sweep everything before them. He sat all night in a terrible storm, fending the
                    drift from the abutments of a bridge which but for this care would have been
                    swept away.</p>
            <p>A sudden rise in Pleasant Run at one time excited his solicitude in regard to the
                    regular <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> train, and unwilling to trust a messenger, he hurried himself to
                    the spot, two miles south of town. The train was approaching. He made vehement
                    gestures for it to stop. The engineer misunderstanding his signals, rushed on
                    and across. Mr. Merrill was prostrated by the agony of mind he endured for about
                    one minute. Good humored, cheerful and patient as he was, with a tenderness that
                    made his eye fill, and his lips quiver at the sight of another's woe,
                    a hand open as the day to melting charity, and ever a deferential respect for
                    man as man in any rank or class of society, he was utterly intolerant of
                    meanness, of hardness, and even of thoughtlessness. His anger was quick, flaming
                    and fierce like lightning. One said of him, and said well, "He
                    maintained in sublime combination the sternest ideas of justice with the most
                    beautiful simplicity and childlike sweetness of manners."</p>
            <p>"He was impulsive, and may sometimes have been imprudent," said
                    one of his old friends, "but he was made of heroic stuff and more like
                    our revolutionary fathers than any man I ever met."</p>
            <p>For years, during the early history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a band of rowdies in and about the town, persecuted negroes, threw
                    rotten eggs at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Abolitionists</settlement>
                    </placeName>, disturbed religious meetings, and waged war generally against
                    peace and order. Mr. Merrill was outspoken in denunciation of these rascals,
                    threatening them with the severities of the law. The ringleader of the gang came
                    into the bank one day prepared for fight. Mr. Merrill laughingly looked up from
                    his desk as the rowdy, with coat off and sleeves rolled up, dared any man to lay
                    hands on him, and said, "Mr. B., you brag too much."
                    "Come out," roared the bully, "and try me."
                    Out stepped the banker in his neat broadcloth and floored the bully three times
                    in succession. The fellow picked himself up without a word, sneaked off, and
                    never again took an active part in public disturbances. Years after, one bitter
                    cold night, Mr. Merrill was roused from sleep by the voice of a drunkard in what
                    was then a lane back of his house. He hurried on his clothes and went some

                    Bringing him in, making a fire and preparing a bed for him, he discovered that
                    the helpless creature was his old antagonist. If not the first, Mr. Merrill was
                    one of the first presidents of the Temperance Society of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and of the State Colonization Society. He took an active part in
                    educational movements, taught school several times, was a trustee of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College, superintendent of the First Methodist Sabbath school, and
                    of the Second and Fourth Presbyterian. He was an elder in both the latter
                    churches. His love of books never waned. The delight with which in his youth he
                    read the <hi rend="i">Woverly Novels</hi> as they came from the hand of the
                    "Great Magician" was scarcely greater than that with which in
                    his later years he pondered over Neander, Ranke, Macaulay, or Carlyle. If at
                    sixteen his enjoyment in literature was more intense, at sixty it was more
                    profound. As his humanity comprehended men of all classes and character, so his
                    taste in literature, while pure and refined, was universal. With all his ardor
                    and activity, Mr. Merrill was modest even to timidity. Much of the good that he
                    did was never known to others, and was not remembered by himself. But

            <p>The region which now embraces <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, was once the home of the Piankeshaw Indians, a tribe
                    which belonged to the Miami federation. In about the year 1767 the Piankeshaws
                    made a treaty with the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> Indians who thereby gained certain privileges, although actual
                    possession was not relinquished by the former tribe.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of the nineteenth century the fertile lands of this region
                    began to attract the white man. Prior to that time the only pale faces who had
                    visited this region were explorers and trappers who passed up and down
                        <geogName>White river</geogName> in canoes at intervals. Among these first
                    visitors were the Jesuit missionaries, who were always well received among the
                    Indians.</p>
            <p>It was about the year 1805 or 1806 that the first white men began to visit this
                    territory with a view of forming settlements. They came from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> which had been established about 100 years and was known as the
                    "Old Post."</p>
            <p>The exploring parties from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> had carried home favorable reports of the fertility of the lands
                    lying along <geogName>White river</geogName> and our own meandering
                        <geogName>Eel river</geogName>. These explorers came in pirogues or canoes,
                    by the river route, that being the only line of travel except the Indian trails
                    through the forests. Consequently the first settlements were formed along the
                    rivers. Much of the adjacent territory being wet and marshy, elevated localities
                    were chosen as sites for settlements.</p>
            <p>The bold bluff, later known as Point Commerce, had long attracted the eye of the
                    voyagers and explorers, and as a result one of the first settlements in what is
                    now <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene county</region>
                    </placeName> was formed on that elevation. It is known that a settlement was
                    formed there as early as 1812. In a few years considerable of a settlement <pb n="61" id="VAA4025-012-1-063"/> had been established and clearings cut in
                    the forest in that locality.</p>
            <p>Among the first settlers were Edmond Jean, Edward Dyer, Samuel Dyer, Richard Wall
                    and Thomas Smith. Later there came George Griffith, John Sanders, Caleb Jessup,
                    James Stalcup, Thomas Stalcup, John Jessup, Jonathan Osborn, Eli Dickson, Thomas
                    Clark, William Winters, Hiram Hicks, John Craig, John Stanley, Benjamin
                    Shoemaker, William Lemons, Joab Wilsher, Henry Littlejohn and others. Some of
                    these pioneers have descendants who are among the leading families of today.
                    They entered land and acquired titles which have passed down to their posterity.
                    Cabins were built, fields were cleared and homes were made in the forests. These
                    settlers were hardy backwoodsmen, long accustomed to the hardships and
                    privations of a life in the forests. In a few years the settlement at Point
                    Commerce had spread over the adjacent territory.</p>
            <p>Their cabins grew in number, their clearings broadened into fields and conditions
                    improved each year. Corn was the principal crop, but soon wheat was sown and
                    orchards were planted. Samuel Dyer and Richard Wall' raised the first
                    wheat. It was threshed, or beaten out, with flails on quilts in the door yards
                    of the raisers.</p>
            <p>Richard Wall, who had brought a quart of apple seed from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, divided with his neighbors and in time each settler had a small
                    orchard. Cotton was raised, spun and woven. Some raised sheep and wool was
                    carded, spun and woven into cloth. Everybody wore home-spun and hand-made
                    garments in those days.</p>
            <p>By the resistless encroachment of the pale faces the Red Men had been pushed back
                    before a settlement was ever formed in this region; consequently the pioneers
                    were in no danger of Indian massacre. The war-whoop, the tomahawk and the
                    scalping knife had lost their terror and the block house was not a necessity in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene county</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Yet the pioneers remembered the sufferings and the dangers of what they called
                    "early days" in other places. From such dangers the first
                    settlers of this region were exempt. Yet their hardships and privations were
                    great. They were the advance guard which blazed the way for the civilization
                    which we enjoy and to them we owe a debt of gratitude we can never pay. Let us
                    perpetuate their memory.</p>
            <p>This is one of our purposes in publishing this brief history.</p>
            <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-012-1-064"/>
            <p>An absorbing interest, which excels the most thrilling romance, permeates the
                    story of the pioneers who first hewed homes out of the forests.</p>
            <p>Volumes have been written about the adventures, dangers and hardships of the
                    forerunners of civilization, who enacted the first chapter in the wonderful
                    drama which transformed a wilderness into a populous land of culture and
                    advancement, yet the most facile pen, the most gifted tongue and the deepest
                    research fail to exhaust the subject or to do full justice to the brave men and
                    women who were the links in the chain of history which transformed the
                    wilderness.</p>
            <p>Before the old town of Point Commerce, at the rivers' junction, was
                    started, a settlement had been formed in that locality and was slowly spreading
                    over the adjacent territory. The cabins had steadily increased in number and
                    grown in dimensions, year by year. Log houses were the only homes outside the
                    village, for a full generation.</p>
            <p>The people were happy and contented amid their primitive surroundings. The first
                    settlers had each "entered" a large tract of land, and,
                    consequently, the cabins and clearings were widely separated. One's
                    nearest neighbor often lived three miles away. Yet they visited and mingled in a
                    very neighborly way.</p>
            <p>Neighbors exchanged visits in cordial hospitality. Often the whole family went
                    and spent a day with a neighbor, perhaps several miles away. "Come,
                    bring your knitting and the children and stay all day," was the common
                    form of invitation for the women; while "our latch-string hangs
                    out" meant that a hospitable welcome awaited the guest.</p>
            <p>Ox teams did all heavy hauling and sleds were used instead of wagons. A carriage
                    was seldom seen in those days. To possess a family carriage would have been
                    considered positive evidence of great wealth. The wagons had wooden axles and
                    linchpins.</p>
            <p>Social gatherings were not overlooked in early days. The neighbors held
                    corn-huskings, apple-cuttings, and frolics, at which both old and young
                    assembled. While the young folks danced, to the stirring strains of the fiddle,
                    the old folks looked on in admiration and talked their homely matters over, in
                    mutual exchange.</p>
            <p>People rode horseback, or walked to church, parties or other <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-012-1-065"/> places. To own a horse, saddle and bridle was the
                    ambition of every young man. When a beau desired to accompany his sweetheart
                    home from church, or to escort her to a dance, she rode behind him on horseback.
                    Often jolly crowds of young folks enjoyed a ride on big bob-sleds in winter when
                    the snow was deep.</p>

                    </placeName> was organized in 1821. Prior to that time it had been a part of
                    Sullivan county, and the county seat was at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Carlisle</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Those who had official business to transact had to ride to that
                    town. Previously both had been a part of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox county</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> being the county seat. All official business was transacted there.
                    Those who had county business to transact went to that town, which had been
                    settled in October, 1702.1 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Carlisle</settlement>
                    </placeName> is the next oldest town in the state, it is claimed.</p>
            <p>The first county election was held at the home of Thomas Bradford. The following
                    officers were elected: Norman W. Pearce and John L. Buskirk, associate judges;
                    John Seaman, county sheriff; Thomas Warnick, county clerk; Thomas Bradford,
                    collector; John Owen, county treasurer; George Shroyer, county recorder. All
                    were required to swear that they had not engaged in duels, either as principals
                    or as seconds, and had not challenged any man to fight a duel.</p>
            <p>The first county seat was at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Burlington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, that being the exact geographical center of the county. It was on
                    the east bank of <geogName>White river</geogName>, directly opposite the pioneer
                    town of Fairplay. A city was laid off in the woods, a public square was located
                    and a courthouse erected at a cost of $250. The county officials had
                    their offices there and court was held there, from May, 1822, to May, 1823. A
                    well was dug, but no water could be obtained. The old well still is located on
                    the original public square, which is now a part of the farm of Nicholas Flater,
                    of Richland township.</p>
            <p>Two roads were surveyed, one running north and south and the other east and west,
                    to the county lines. No town, it appears, was ever established there, although <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Burlington</settlement>
                    </placeName> was laid off for a city. A ferry was operated across
                        <geogName>White river</geogName> to Fairphy, where there were a few stores
                    and several homes.</p>
            <p>On finding that water was not obtainable at the site selected, <list type="footnotes">

               </list>
                    <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-012-1-066"/> a petition was submitted to the legislature
                    praying to have the county seat relocated. The prayer of the petitioners was
                    granted and a commission appointed to choose another site for the county seat.
                    This commission consisted of Amos Rogers, William White, Charles Polk and
                    Abraham Case.</p>
            <p>Owing to the fact that Fairplay was so near the center of the county and being a
                    town, and having plenty of good water, all expected that it would be selected as
                    the county seat. Yet the citizens of the village were too confident and offered
                    no inducement. But the citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> showed more enterprise and offered the necessary inducements. A
                    site was offered free and the county seat was located at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in 1823, and still remains there.</p>

                        <region type="county">Greene county</region>
                    </placeName> was first organized it was subdivided into five townships as
                    follows:</p>
            <p>Highland: Which included what are now Jefferson, Smith, Wright and Highland
                    townships; so named on account of the hills along <geogName>White</geogName> and
                        <geogName>Eel rivers</geogName>.</p>
            <p>Richland: Which included what are now Fairplay, Grant, Stockton and Richland
                    townships.</p>
            <p>Burlingame: Which included what are now Beech Creek, Center and Jackson
                    townships.</p>
            <p>Plummer: Which included what are now Taylor and Cass townships.</p>
            <p>Stafford: Which included what are now <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Stafford townships.</p>
            <p>The first settlement in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene county</region>
                    </placeName> was formed at Point Commerce in 1812.</p>
            <p>The second settlement in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene county</region>
                    </placeName> was formed at Fairplay, on <geogName>White river</geogName>, five
                    miles below Point Commerce. It had ISO inhabitants. After a brief existence the
                    old town perished. There was a ford just above the ferry.</p>
            <p>Newberry, on <geogName>White river</geogName>, was the third town in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene county</region>
                    </placeName>. It was settled in 1822, when a store was opened there by John
                    Ritter. Mike Neff erected a grist mill and started a ferry. In canal days
                    Newberry was a place of importance. It is still a prosperous little town.</p>
            <p>The fourth settlement formed in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene county</region>
                    </placeName> was at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This became the county seat in 1823.</p>
            <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-012-1-067"/>
            <p>The fifth settlement in this county was at <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>, on Doan's creek, in 1834. That is now a quiet hamlet.</p>
            <p>The sixth settlement in <placeName>

                    city.</p>
            <p>In 1828 Jefferson and old <geogName>Eel River</geogName> townships were formed.
                    They remained separate townships until 1881 when they were merged into one,
                    under the name of the former, Jefferson. Old <geogName>Eel River</geogName>
                    township lay between <geogName>White</geogName> and <geogName>Eel
                    rivers</geogName> and extended northward to the county line. The first
                    settlement was in that locality, which is still often designated by its orginal
                    name.</p>
            <p>Upon the formation of <geogName>Eel River</geogName> township an election was
                    held at the home of Mr. Dayhuff and the following officers were elected:
                    Election inspector, Henry Little John; fence viewers, Alexander Watson and
                    Jonathan Brashears; overseers of the poor, John Sanders and Caleb Jessup.</p>
            <p>The second election in old <geogName>Eel River</geogName> township was held at
                    the home of Mr. Sanders, when the officers chosen were as follows: Election
                    inspector, Ephriam Owen; road superintendents, Richard Wall and G. W. Haton;
                    overseers of the poor, Caleb Jessup and John Archer; fence viewers, Herbert
                    Sanders and Henry Smith.</p>
            <p>The first elections were held in private homes, later in mills, and afterwards in
                    the school houses.</p>
            <p>The hotel and tavern rates were fixed by law as follows:</p>
            <p>Dinner, 25 cents; breakfast, 20 cents; supper, 20 cents; corn and hay for horse,
                    25 cents; whiskey, ½ pint, 12½ cents; cider, quart,
                    12½ cents; rum, ½ pint, 37½ cents; brandy,
                    ½ pint, 50 cents, board and lodging, week $2.00,
                    horsekeeping, week, $1.25.</p>
            <p>The market prices for country produce and live stock were very low in those days.</p>
            <p>Corn was 10 cents per bushel; wheat, 35 cents; cows, $7.50 per head;
                    chickens, 6 cents each; turkeys, 25 cents each. The subscription for a weekly
                    newspaper was $2.50 per year.</p>
            <p>Officers of the law were permitted to arrest fugitive slaves and recover pay for
                    their keeping, until returned to their owners. John Seaman, one of the first
                    sheriffs of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene county</region>
                    </placeName>, was allowed $14 for arresting and keeping one runaway
                    slave, two weeks. William Lemons, constable, was allowed $8.00 for
                    arresting and keeping a fugitive slave for a few days.</p>
            <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-012-1-068"/>
            <p>The usual fee of a minister or a squire for performing a marriage ceremony in
                    early days was 25 cents. Sometimes, the groom desiring to be especially liberal,
                    the preacher was paid 50 cents.</p>

            <p>The Divine Architect of the Universe built a town site at the junction of
                        <geogName>White</geogName> and <geogName>Eel rivers</geogName>. Owing to its
                    advantageous situation it was named Point Commerce. It grew steadily and became
                    the best town on <geogName>White river</geogName>. Stores were started, ferries
                    established, shops were opened, saw-mills were located, boats were built and the
                    pioneer village continued to thrive.</p>
            <p>The first merchant was J. M. H. Allison, who settled there and opened a general
                    store in 1835. Shortly afterward he was joined by his brother, J. F. Allison,
                    who surveyed and named the village. In addition to a large general store the
                    firm engaged extensively in the pork-packing business and in the purchase of the
                    products of the farms, which they shipped to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Sometimes the Allison, Brothers shipped twenty-five or thirty
                    flatboat loads of pork, furs, lumber and grain to the southern market in one
                    season.</p>
            <p>They built a big pork-house on <geogName>Eel river</geogName>, near where it
                    empties into <geogName>White river</geogName>. The farmers slaughtered their
                    hogs and sold them, dressed, to the pork-packers. They also established a double
                    ferry, where the rivers met.</p>
            <p>Allison &amp; Allison built a large hotel which was called the Junction
                    House. It became a famous hotel among river men. There was an old saying:
                    "The Junction House is good enough for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>." The old hotel was brought to Worthington in later years
                    and now forms a part of the Commercial House.</p>
            <p>J. M. H. Allison also erected a fine two-story brick house, which still stands
                    and is now owned and occupied by Jasper Hutchinson. Mr. Allison was an
                    adventurous speculator. It is said he sank a large fortune at Point Commerce.</p>
            <p>In time more merchants came and other lines of business were established so that
                    Point Commerce gave promise of becoming a great city. There were blacksmiths,
                    wagon makers, tailors, tinners, a turning lathe, a cabinet maker, a tannery, a
                    saloon (then called a "grocery"), a saw-mill, a grist-mill and
                    finally a distillery and a powder mill.</p>
            <p>Goods for the stores were bought in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, shipped to <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-012-1-069"/> Pittsburg, floated
                    down to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> on flatboats and then hauled in wagons to Point Commerce.</p>
            <p>Ferries were established. One ferry across <geogName>White river</geogName> was
                    operated by Thomas Smith, about where the wagon bridge now spans that stream.
                    Another ferry was started north of Point Commerce by Jonathan Osborn. Later, the
                    village having become a thriving business center, a double ferry was started at
                    the junction of the rivers. Another ferry was started across <geogName>Eel
                    river</geogName>, where the wagon bridge now spans that stream.</p>
            <p>Some years later a wagon bridge was built over <geogName>Eel river</geogName>,
                    just above where the I. &amp; V. railroad bridge is now located. The large
                    rocks on the south bank of that stream formed a natural abutment for that end of
                    the old wooden bridge. A wagon road ran along the ridge, now known as
                    Hays' Heights, and descended to the bridge where the orchard of
                    Herman Kautz is located.</p>
            <p>In time a large brick Methodist church was built. Later it was razed and the
                    brick used to build the residence now owned and occupied by Marcus Hays.</p>
            <p>A two-story frame building was erected, the lower story being used as school room
                    and the upper story as a Masonic Hall. Later this building was transferred to
                    Worthington and used as a carpenter shop by Squire Riggs. It still stands, near
                    the Water &amp; Light Plant.</p>
            <p>A grist-mill and saw-mill combined stood on the east Dank of <geogName>Eel
                    river</geogName> at the old "Indian ford." Later, a carding
                    mill and subsequently a weaving department were added. Lumber was sawed, cloth
                    was woven, flour, meal and feed were ground and shipped down the river to the
                    southern market. That important industry was owned and operated, in later years,
                    by Samuel Miller, father of F. N. Miller. There were two saw-mills on
                        <geogName>Eel river</geogName> between the first wagon bridge and
                        <geogName>White river</geogName>.</p>
            <p>Later, another pork house was built on the east bank of <geogName>Eel
                    river</geogName>, just above where the wagon bridge now spans the stream. It.
                    was established by E. H. Sabin, who was a preacher as well as a pork-packer.</p>
            <p>W. C. Andrews, father of W. C. Andrews, the hardware merchant, came in 1839 and
                    opened a general store. Later, the firm became Andrews &amp; Topping. In
                    addition to conducting a large general store they did an extensive shipping
                    business.</p>
            <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-012-1-070"/>
            <p>Among the pioneer business men and firms of Old Point Commerce were the
                    following:</p>
            <p>J. M. H. and J. F. Allison, W. C. Andrews, John Barekman, Andrews &amp;
                    Toppings, Mclntyre &amp; Jaquis, Joseph Miller, general merchants; William
                    Bradshaw, cabinet maker; Wilson Helms, carpenter; T. Messick and J. Stanley,
                    tailors; J. Barekeman, squire; John Beach and James Abbott, shoemakers; Sam and
                    Alf Willy, blacksmiths; William Wooden, wagon maker; Bob Leach, wood workman;
                    Fount Gooley, harness and saddle-maker; Isreal Carroll, coffins and undertaking;
                    Jesse Brazier, brewer and baker; Jesse Brazier, saloon; Sam Miller, saw-mill;
                    Aaron Craigg, woolen mill; John Sanders, distillery; Jonathan Osborn, powder
                    mill; William Bays, squire.</p>
            <p>Mr. W. G. Sanders, of Point Commerce, whose grandparents were among the first
                    settlers, recalled the names of merchants and other pioneers, besides many
                    interesting events in the old flat-boat days, when Point Commerce was in her
                    prime. Mr. Sanders remembers when his father had a distillery and made corn
                    whisky, apple brandy and peach brandy.</p>
            <p>Often he would haul a barrel of whisky to other points, in an ox-cart, and sell
                    it at 12½ cents per gallon.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sanders remembers Rev. Eli Farmer, pioneer circuit rider, who preached at
                    Point Commerce. He was a great exhorter.</p>
            <p>The first school house, which Mr. Sanders recalls was a small brick structure,
                    which stood near where the residence of B. F. Hays is situated.</p>
            <p>"In those days," said Mr. Sanders, "the people made
                    the jeans and woolseys for their clothes which were all home-made. When I was a
                    boy, drunkenness was much more common than it is now. The elections were then
                    held in August. Several rough and tumble fist fights always occurred on every
                    election day, as well as at all horse races or other public
                    gatherings."</p>
            <p>Before the first cabins were built by white men at Point Commerce, the last
                    tepees of the red men had disappeared. But occasionally a roving band of Indians
                    visited the place. They were peaceful and some of them could speak
                    "broken" English. If on foot or on horseback, they traveled
                    single file, and crossed <geogName>Eel river</geogName> at the old Indian ford.
                    But more often they floated leisurely down the streams in canoes, stopping here
                    and there to hunt and to barter with the whites.</p>
            <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-012-1-071"/>
            <p>In September, 1819, a band of redskins visited this region. They numbered 300,
                    and belonged to a single tribe, probably the Piankeshaws. They were on horseback
                    and passed along the old Indian trail and crossed <geogName>Eel river</geogName>
                    at the old Indian ford, a fourth mile north of where the wagon bridge now spans
                    this stream.</p>
            <p>A few days later another band of Indians, numbering 200, floated down
                        <geogName>White river</geogName> in bark canoes and camped at the mouth of
                        <geogName>Eel river</geogName>. That was on Sunday, September 30, 1819.</p>
            <p>The date of this last visit of the Indians is fixed by the fact that a wedding of
                    a pioneer white couple occurred on that day. It was probably the first wedding
                    solemnized in the old Point Commerce settlement. John Fires and Miss Martha
                    Craig were married at noon that day by Alexander Craig, who had a grist-mill at
                    the junction of <geogName>White</geogName> and <geogName>Eel rivers</geogName>.
                    The entire settlement had assembled to celebrate the first wedding.</p>
            <p>Directly after the ceremony the wedding party was greatly surprised and terribly
                    startled by the arrival of the big band of savages. Some feared a massacre. But
                    the Indians were friendly.</p>
            <p>The bride and groom and others of the wedding party walked down to the river to
                    see the Indians. The chief was a young brave who only a few days previously had
                    been married himself to a pretty Indian maiden of his own tribe. But on seeing
                    the blushing young paleface bride, the chief was so pleased with her appearance
                    that he offered to swap wives. The bride was very indignant at. the
                    Indian's presumption. She was but fifteen years old and quite comely.
                    The audacity of the savage was further shown by the fact that he demanded a
                    blanket and a bear skin to boot.</p>
            <p>The next marriages which occurred in the Point Commerce settlement were the
                    following:</p>
            <p>Isaac Jackson and Elizabeth Griffith, by Rev. Hugh Barnes, August 9, 1821; David
                    Smith and Mary Byson, by Squire Edmond Jean, October 25, 1821; Philip Silver and
                    Sarah Lindley, by Squire John B. Kelshaw, January 10, 1822; John Fires and Patsy
                    Craig, by Squire Edmond Jean, May 19, 1822; Eli Duncan and Rebecca Stevenson, by
                    Squire William Clark, July, 1822; Peyton Owen and Rachel Griffith, Richard Wall
                    and Mary Dyer, Herbert Sanders and Jessie Jessup, Samuel Dyer and Celia Arney,
                    Aquilla Walker and Elizabeth Dyer, William Foley and Jane Osborn, Ira Danley and
                    Olive Jessup, Joseph Smith and Sallie Jessup, William Huey <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-012-1-072"/> and Sally Stanley, John Stanley and Mary Ball,
                    Abram Shoemaker and Maria Morris, Obediah Winters and Hanna Duncan, Thomas Huey
                    and Vasta Steward, Joshua Duncan and Maria Shoemaker, William Smith and Mary
                    McKee.</p>
            <p>Before any churches, or "meeting houses" were built, services
                    were held in the cabins, by the circuit riders who rode from place to place on
                    horseback. The services were always well attended and the pioneers were, as a
                    class, religious. The singing was congregational and the hymns were lined-off by
                    the preacher and then sung by the people, often with more force than melody.
                    These services gave the settlers an opportunity to meet and greet each other,
                    which they did in cordial manner. Good old fashioned
                    "handshakes" always followed the meetings in which the
                    exhorters often stirred their hearers into shouting. The religion of that day
                    was more demonstrative than that of the present.</p>
            <p>Spelling schools were another meeting place for the people, and proved both
                    beneficial and enjoyable.</p>
            <p>The first saw-mills were very primitive, slow and laborious. The log had to be
                    elevated. Then two men, with what is usually called a whip saw, cut it into
                    boards. One sawyer stood on the log and the other under it. The lower position
                    was disagreeable, on account of the sawdust falling into the sawyer's
                    eyes, when he looked up to see his work, which was, of course, necessary.</p>
            <p>For a time the nearest grist-mill was at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the settlers had to go there to have their corn and wheat
                    ground. But later horse-mills and water-mills were built.</p>
            <p>Land was cheap in those days and could be bought for from fifty cents to
                    $2.50 per acre. What was known as "congress" land
                    was valued at $1.25 per acre. The swamp lands could not then have
                    been given away. By drainage it has become the most valuable now.</p>
            <p>Wages were low. Farm hands were paid $5.00 and $6.00 per
                    month. They worked hard and long.</p>
            <p>The first settlement, for many years, was the best and always remained a model of
                    thrift and enterprise. And when a town was later established there, it led all
                    others in its progress and its advancement, in commercial activity, in
                    education, in religion and in cleanliness. The place was often called
                    "White Town," a name in which the inhabitants were justly
                    complimented. The houses <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-012-1-073"/> and other buildings
                    and fences were kept neatly dressed in whitewash. To the voyagers, ascending or
                    descending the rivers, to the "movers," ever passing, the
                    little town of gleaming white on the hill, surrounded by the forest of green,
                    was like a beckoning invitation to a haven of rest and comfort.</p>
            <p>In this the village patterned after the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where the mud houses of the pioneer French settlers were kept in
                    spotless white, at all seasons, by a plentiful use of white-wash, made from
                    lime, formed by burning mussel shells. The French women were models of
                    cleanliness, neatness and industry, although so much can hardly be claimed for
                    their husbands, many of whom were prone to idleness and inebriacy, caring more
                    for fiddles and whisky than they did for wealth and education.</p>
            <p>But this was not true of the men in the "White Town" community.
                    They worked and developed the country; established ferries and bridges, mills
                    and stores, schools and churches, more rapidly than their French
                    "neighbors" had done at the "Old Post," on
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The first grist-mills established in the Old Point Commerce settlement were
                    operated by hand and were very primitive. Their product was a coarse
                    "unbolted" meal. Then horse-power mills were started.
                    Subsequently water mills were built. To secure power, dams were built across the
                    streams.</p>
            <p>It is claimed that Alexander Craig built and operated the first mill at Point
                    Commerce. Then Thomas Clark started a "tub"-mill on
                    Clark's creek.</p>
            <p>Later the Junction water mill was established by Daniel and Peter Ingersoll, at
                    the Rock Ford, on <geogName>Eel river</geogName>. It became an important
                    enterprise. People came there with their grists, for many miles
                    around–often remaining two or three days, waiting their turns,
                    fishing meanwhile in the mill-race.</p>
            <p>Above its junction with <geogName>Eel river</geogName>, the
                        "<geogName>White river</geogName> Mills" were established
                    and a dam built, on the latter stream, and operated by Green Tally, Amos Owen
                    and Ira Danley, successively, on the Haxton farm. A part of the old dam remains.</p>
            <p>Game was so plentiful that the pioneers procured their meat with their rifles.
                    Bears and deer were so often killed that their skins became a staple product of
                    the land. Fur-bearing animals were so numerous that trapping was a profitable
                    enterprise in the winter <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-012-1-074"/> season. There being
                    little money, skins and furs became a commodity of such regular barter that they
                    were almost a "legal tender."</p>
            <p>Owing to the ever-shifting habits of men who, even in that day, were moving
                    westward, the travel overland was wonderful. And, as all merchandise was hauled
                    overland, an almost constant stream of wagons were coming and going, when the
                    roads were passable. Four and six-horse teams were the rule. The ferries as a
                    result were busy all the day. Besides, the taverns along the "big
                    roads" or principal thoroughfares were located at intervals and did a
                    profitable business. Owing to the frequent attempts at extortions, the rates
                    were finally fixed by law.</p>
            <p>Near Point Commerce is located the famous "Devil's Tea
                    Table," an interesting geological formation, which has been called the
                    "Plymouth Rock of Point Commerce." It is nearly one hundred
                    feet high, and by its elevation and its location near <geogName>White
                    river</geogName>, it forms a natural "lookout" and was so used
                    by the Indians and by the pioneer whites. It is covered with the names of its
                    visitors, carved upon its surface. Some were carved there nearly a century ago.</p>
            <p>It is believed that this ancient landmark was used by the Mound Builders as a
                    sacrificial altar.</p>
            <p>Just below it, nearer the river, is the "Devil's
                    Chair," a stone formation resembling an immense seat with a back, which
                    has also attracted the attention of the sightseers.</p>
            <p>In those earlier days there was no mail service. Mail routes were not established
                    until about seventy-five years ago. There was a route from Point Commerce to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which brought and received mail weekly. The postage on a letter
                    was twenty-five cents, and was usually paid by the receiver. This was called
                    "lifting" a letter. No envelopes were used. The letters were
                    folded and sealed with wax.</p>
            <p>From the first the settlers in Old <geogName>Eel River</geogName> township showed
                    an interest in the cause of education and maintained the best schools of the
                    county.</p>
            <p>The first school in what was Old <geogName>Eel River</geogName> township was
                    organized in 1821. It was taught by George Baber in a little log house which
                    stood near the home of Caleb Jessup.</p>
            <p>The pioneer teachers, in the order named, were: Henry Sargent, Ephraim Owen, Luke
                    Philbert, William Bray, Joseph Saddle <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-012-1-075"/> and
                    Amos Roark. Each taught a subscription school for a short term in winter.</p>
            <p>Later a school house was built. It stood near the home of Mr. Jessup. Then
                    another school house was erected near the home of Mr. Sanders. In these,
                    successful schools were taught.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fletcher Griffith recalls the names of the following teachers in that
                    community: Rev. Simpson, Carlos Kelsey, Fred Spooner, William Leach, Robert
                    Taylor, Sam Kelshaw, John Curry, William Glover and John Buck.</p>
            <p>In 1830 there were five school houses in <geogName>Jefferson</geogName> and
                        <geogName>Eel River</geogName> townships. The schools grew in number and the
                    course of study was improved year by year.</p>
            <p>Finally the famous Point Commerce Academy was founded in 1869 by Prof. E. E.
                    Henry and Rev. John Laverty, both of whom were able educators. Students came
                    from the surrounding country and from distant towns. The higher branches were
                    taught. Its course of study was similar to the modern high school.</p>
            <p>For a few years Point Commerce Academy flourished. Then Prof. Henry accepted a
                    position elsewhere and the school finally closed. Mr. Laverty later was a clerk
                    in Dr. Squire's drug store in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Worthington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The history of Point Commerce would be incomplete without a sketch
                    of James M. H. Allison. He and his brother, John F. Allison, came from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Point Commerce in the fall of 1836, and opened a store. They
                    bought land and laid off a town and named it Point Commerce.</p>
            <p>In the following summer J. M. H. Allison erected the famous old Junction House,
                    which stood on the corner on the east side of the street about where the little
                    frame school house is now situated. His brother-in-law, Dr. David Shepherd, was
                    the first landlord of the hotel. It was of frame, two stories and was a
                    substantial building. The lumber was sawed by Mr. Allison at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName> and floated down <geogName>White river</geogName>. The old hotel
                    was brought to Worthington in 1880, by Tip Osborn, who started a hotel here.</p>
            <p>A year later, in 1838, Mr. Allison brought his family to Point Commerce. They
                    first occupied a frame cottage, which stood just east of the hotel, then moved
                    into another home. Later, they lived in the hotel, until 1844, when Mr. Allison
                    erected the two-story brick residence overlooking the beautiful prospect where
                    the two rivers meet. The house still stands and is occupied by <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jasper</region>
                    </placeName> Hutchinson.</p>
            <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-012-1-076"/>
            <p>Jas. M. H. Allison was of British ancestry. He was born at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elizabethtown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>, September 11, 1802. He was a large, portly man, weighing over 200
                    pounds, an ardent Whig, a faithful Methodist and a man of wonderful enterprise
                    and generosity.</p>
            <p>Mr. Allison was married twice. His first wife was Julia Ann Payne, who died
                    childless, eighteen months after their marriage. In 1828, Mr. Allison married
                    Julia Ann Applegate, daughter of a wealthy tobacco dealer of
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. To them were born
                    thirteen children, two of whom survive, viz.: Squire Geo. F. Allison of this
                    town and Dr. David E. Allison, dentist, of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">St. Paul</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
               </placeName>. Mr. Allison died at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in 1877.</p>
            <p>The firm of Allison &amp; Allison did an extensive business as general
                    merchants, pork-packers and dealers in produce, which they shipped down the
                    river to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Frequently they would have $40,000 worth of pork and
                    produce in their warehouse and pork house, waiting for the river to reach
                    boating stage. In addition of this the Allisons owned several hundred acres of
                    land. Their possessions included that part of what is now Worthington north of
                    Union street, and extending northward to Johnstown; also west of what is now
                    Worthington.</p>
            <p>James M. H. Allison, the principal owner of the business and real estate,
                    possessed large means and had great wealth at his command; but his generosity
                    helped bring on a financial crash, which occurred in 1852.</p>
            <p>His son, 'Squire George F. Allison, to whom we are indebted for much
                    of the data in this chapter, says:</p>
            <p>"My father was the principal contributor in building the first school
                    house and the first Methodist church at Point Commerce. Without his aid neither
                    would have been built. When any money was needed for church purposes, school
                    expenses, or for some public enterprise, J. M. H. Allison always headed the list
                    of subscribers and made up the balance, after the subscriptions of other
                    citizens had been received. Usually the largest portion of the whole amount was
                    left for father to pay. He paid the preachers and the teachers, the most of what
                    they received. Many times my father paid the taxes for his neighbors and then
                    waited until they brought him their produce. Some of them never paid him. He was
                    too generous for his own good. He donated to everything and assisted his friends
                    in the hour of need. Then, when he lay sick and all thought he was on his
                    death-bed, in the summer of 1852, some men whom he had befriended sent out false
                    and misleading reports about him, which damaged his credit and brought on his
                    financial ruin."</p>
            <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-012-1-077"/>
            <p>"I remember when my father chartered the steamboat 'J. B.
                    Porter' at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and loaded it with goods for his store at Point Commerce.</p>
            <p>"In the spring of 1841 father loaded twenty-one flatboats with pork and
                    other produce and shipped them to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Two of the boats sank and their cargoes were lost, before reaching
                    their destination.".</p>
            <p>'Squire Allison recalls the names of the old flatboat pilots: Anderson
                    Harvey, James Harvey, KyGooden, Tom Archer, Joseph Osborn and William Kesterson.</p>
            <p>Much of the hauling was then done in wagons, from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Point Commerce. Mr. Allison recalls the names of the old
                    wagoners, who used to drive four and six horse teams: Robert Fulton, Howard
                    Crantz, James Buckner, Adam Stroops, Jonathan Peyton, Jerry Buckner, Samuel
                    Chaney, George Rhinehard and Joseph Huey. Pie also remembers the names of some
                    of the men who used to clerk in his father's store: Robert Howe, John
                    Barekman, John Farmer, 'Squire Andrews and his uncle, John F.
                    Allison.</p>
            <p>The names of the preachers, which 'Squire Allison recalls, are as
                    follows: Revs. Eli P. Farmer, John Williams, Abediah Winters, James Lathrop,
                    William Mayson, W. F. Harned, ——— Raven-scoff,
                    ———Sabin and John Hancock.</p>
            <p>He remembers, likewise, when the street which passed in front of the hotel and
                    his father's store, ran down to the wharf at the rivers'
                    junction. Hundreds of heavily loaded wagons, drawn by four and six horse teams,
                    were pulled up that steep incline every season. When he was a boy Point Commerce
                    was a good business town. It was a busy place and there was bustle and action
                    everywhere. Pork houses, grist-mills, cotton gins, carding mills, sawmills,
                    tannery, distillery, ferries, shops, stores, "coffee house,"
                    and all other pioneer enterprises were active. All expected that Point Commerce
                    would one day become a great city. Its founder, J. M.-H. Allison, had proudly
                    spoken of it as the "Pittsburg of the West."</p>
            <p>'Squire Allison rememmbers the times when other crowds assembled
                    besides those who met for worship. He remembers when the voters came from the
                    surrounding country to vote on election days and on Muster day. The spring, or
                    local elections, were held in April, and the county elections in August.</p>
            <p>The use of liquor was more general in early days than it is now. The records show
                    that when public officials met to transact business <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-012-1-078"/> that whisky bills were put into their expense
                    accounts and allowed as necessities.</p>
            <p>But whisky, then as now, was a great curse and finally the better class of people
                    began to oppose its use and to stop drunkenness, which was alarmingly common.
                    Every public gathering was annoyed by whisky-crazed men and often the meeting
                    was broken up and ended in a drunken riot.</p>
            <p>Finally a lodge of Washingtonians, a strong pioneer temperance society, was
                    organized at Old Point Commerce. The members used to sing: <quote rend="blockquote"> "The shouts of Washingtonians, Are heard on
                        every gale, They're chanting now their victory, O'er
                        whiskey, beer and ale." </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Yet another member of that family, who was a man of influence at Point Commerce
                    and surrounding territory, was John F. Allison, a younger brother of J. M. H.
                    Allison.</p>
            <p>John F. Allison was born in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bourbon county</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, July 10, 1814. His father was a man of wealth and the owner of
                    many slaves, which he had inherited, but he did not believe that one man had a
                    right to own another. Consequently he liberated his slaves; yet as Mr. Allison
                    had been a humane master, some of his negroes declined their proffered freedom
                    and remained in the service of their former owner.</p>
            <p>John F. Allison was the youngest of three brothers. Both of the older brothers
                    were engaged in the mercantile business, Noah at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName> and James, with whom the subject of this sketch was associated, at
                    Point Commerce, where they had opened the first store on the 17th day of
                    November, 1835.</p>
            <p>Being a man of education and an experienced civil engineer, John F. Allison
                    surveyed and laid off the town of Point Commerce and took an active part in its
                    affairs. No other man had a wider acquaintance throughout this region than the
                    younger member of the firm of Allison &amp; Allison, of Point Commerce. He
                    had the especial charge of the outdoor branch of their business, made frequent
                    trips to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and occasionally journeyed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and to Pittsburg, besides covering, on horseback, by stage and by
                    boat, the surrounding territory, which broadened his acquaintance until he was
                    the best-known and most popular man in this region during his day.</p>
            <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-012-1-079"/>
            <p>Hon. John F. Allison was an ardent Whig. He served three terms in the State
                    Legisalture, two as Representative and one as Senator. He was first elected to
                    the House of Representatives from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene county</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1839. Two years later he was offered the nomination to a seat
                    in the State Senate, but declined and was soon afterward renominated and elected
                    to a second term as Representative.</p>
            <p>In 1844, Mr. Allison was elected Senator from the district composed of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName> and Owen counties.</p>
            <p>John F. Allison was an orator and recognized as the best political speaker in
                    this section of the State. In 1840 he stumped the State for William Henry
                    Harrison and participated in the great political debates of his day, and was the
                    relentless foe of slavery. His oratorical ability and his strenuous activity
                    made Mr. Allison a leader in both House and Senate. He fought, with
                    characteristic vigor, for the repeal of the law which allowed the imprisonment
                    of men for debt. While in the State Senate he was one of the leading advocates
                    of the great compromise measure, known as the Butler Bill, which became a law
                    and saved the State from bankruptcy.</p>
            <p>But John F. Allison did not confine himself to political and commercial affairs
                    alone. He was a leader in every public enterprise and made tremendous sacrifices
                    of time and money, for the good of the community, and for internal improvements.
                    He advocated the first railroad project, the great "Air Line,"
                    to which he gave twelve hundred acres of land, then valued at $8,000.
                    It would now be worth $80,000.</p>
            <p>Mr. Allison was also active in the first effort to build a railroad from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He served one year, without pay, as secretary of the board of
                    directors, besides making a cash donation of $1,000. Later he
                    assisted in promoting the I. &amp; V. railroad, which was built in 1869 and
                    donated $1,000 to the enterprise.</p>
            <p>Johnstown, which was a place of considerable business in the old canal days, was
                    named after John F. Allison. He opened the first store there. Mr. Allison died
                    in 1885, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>'Squire George F. Allison recalls the names of the teachers who taught
                    at Point Commerce, in the little old brick school house, which stood north of
                    the big brick church. They were: James Freeman, Miss Rowel, Thomas Rowark, Henry
                    Grim, Mary Taylor, Ann Ritter, Hiram Hanshot and William Leach.</p>
            <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-012-1-080"/>
            <p>Before the church was erected religious services were held in the school house.
                    Previous to the building of the school house they used to hold services in the
                    hotel, the famous old Junction House, owned by Allison &amp; Allison. The
                    dining room was used for the meetings and when the crowd was large, the door
                    leading to the barroom was opened. Rev. Farmer, an uncle of J. M. H. Allison,
                    often preached there.</p>
            <p>The old brick church at Point Commerce was called Wesley Chapel. It was erected
                    in 1849. It was 40x80 feet in size and was two stories high. It stood almost
                    directly opposite the one-story brick residence which still stands and is
                    occupied by Clarence Cressy. This cottage was built by Dr. Shepherd, a
                    brother-in-law of J. M. H. Allison, as a residence. It was occupied later by
                    'Squire William S. Bays, who had married the doctor's
                    widow after his death.</p>
            <p>The brick for the old church at Point Commerce were burned across the road from
                    where the residence of B. F. Hays now stands.</p>
            <p>George F. Allison remembers when the first church society was organized at Point
                    Commerce, in the little old brick school house, with the following members:
                    George Helm, Jesse Brazier, James Denton, John Yarnell, Robert Stricklin, George
                    Griffith, Thomas Messick and Cavin Spooner. Mr. Helm and Mr. Griffith were
                    class-leaders.</p>
            <p>The first quarterly meeting at Point Commerce was in 1840. It was conducted by
                    Rev. McGinnis, Presiding Elder. A big revival followed.</p>
            <p>Camp meetings had been held in the old Point Commerce community even before the
                    town was started, and were always well attended.</p>
            <p>The first preacher was Rev. Hugh Barnes, an old Revolutionary soldier. Other old
                    pioneer preachers of that settlement were Rev. James Armstrong, Rev. Obediah
                    Winters and Rev. Eli P. Farmer.</p>
            <p>Old Wesley Chapel, at Point Commerce, was a stately and substantial edifice and
                    was the best known church in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene county</region>
                    </placeName> for many years. Some great revivals were held there and the leading
                    ministers of those early days, who visited this region, preached in the old
                    church. The people for miles around met and worshipped there for a half century.</p>
            <p>The old church outlasted the pioneer town which it had blessed <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-012-1-081"/> by its divine and powerful influence, by many
                    years. Long after Worthington had grown up into a good town and Point Commerce
                    had fallen into decay, the ancient church on the hill was still the meeting
                    place for the Methodists of this locality. Commercially Point Commerce came to
                    Worthington, but spiritually the conditions were reversed.</p>
            <p>Finally a Methodist church was built in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Worthington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and gradually the old pioneer church at Point Commerce was
                    abandoned. Its parishioners had died or moved away; the ministers who had
                    preached there in years agone had been called away, some to other fields of
                    labor and others to their eternal rest. And, with all its hallowed memories, the
                    dear old "meeting house" on the hill top stood silent and
                    deserted until the ancient edifice was razed in 1882, by Marcus Hays, Sr.
                    (father of Ben F., Sam F. and Marcus Hays) who bought the building, tore it down
                    and built a residence with the brick. This house, a substantial two-story
                    building, was erected in 1883, and is now the residence of Marcus Hays, son of
                    the builder. In the front gable of the old church, over the door, was a heavy
                    slab of stone, in which was chiseled these words: "Wesley Chapel M. E.
                    Church, 1849." This fixes the date of its erection. The old stone now
                    forms a top for Mark Hays' cistern.</p>
            <p>The pulpit and pews in old Wesley Chapel were of the finest black walnut. They
                    are now doing service in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mount Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName> Methodist church, three miles northwest of old Point Commerce, and
                    are still in splendid condition.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Josephine Andrews, mother of William C. Andrews, the well known hardware
                    dealer, who went to school at Point Commerce and was well acquainted there,
                    remembers many interesting events and personages of that place. She recalls the
                    name of the first Methodist minister who preached at old Wesley Chapel. He was
                    Reverend Gunsaulus.</p>

            <p>In 1851 the entire country was scourged with an epidemic of cholera, and the four
                    doctors fell victims of the disease within three days of each other, leaving
                    Point Commerce without a physician. This is the way some old residents remember
                    the event. Others say that only two of the doctors died; another says three of
                    the doctors <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-012-1-082"/> died of cholera. However,
                    one-fourth of the people died and others fled from the dreaded pestilence.</p>
            <p>Not only did the ancient village on the hill at the rivers' junction
                    suffer, but other towns and cities, all over the land were visited by the awful
                    scourge. In many a city there were scarcely enough well people to bury the dead.
                    The scourge became so fatal and so prevalent that in some large cities, the dead
                    bodies of its victims were carted to their graves and buried without coffins.
                    Burying squads went from house to house, with wagons. Pausing at the door of the
                    house of mourning the men shouted: "Bring on your
                    dead!" and corpse after corpse was loaded into waiting
                    wagons, to be hauled away to the "silent city of the dead" and
                    interred without the usual funeral formalities.</p>
            <p>The feeble words of men fail to express the fullness of sorrow when every heart
                    is burdened with grief and every home is a house of mourning.</p>
            <p>In its nation-wide devastation the scourge stalked with sorrow-leaving strides,
                    from sea to sea in a season, and no protecting angel had "passed
                    over" in advance, for nowhere had the saving spray of hyssop struck the
                    lintel of any door in the land; nor was the monster satisfied with the
                    first-born, but demanded a deadlier toll, and, pitied not its prey. Neither
                    tears, nor prayers, nor doctors, could stay its ravages.</p>

            <p>One of the leading citizens of Point Commerce was William C. Andrews, who
                    conducted a dry goods store there and was postmaster for many years. The
                    postoffice was kept in his store. In those days the postage on a letter was
                    two-bits. Often Postmaster Andrews was asked by the receiver for a loan of
                    twenty-five cents, in order that the interesting missive might be taken home to
                    the family. Some of these loans were never paid; yet, to the good name of those
                    sturdy pioneers, let it be said that Mr. Andrews lost but a few times through
                    accommodating his neighbors in this way.</p>
            <p>Mr. Andrews was also associated with C. J. Barekman in the pork and grain
                    business. They bought such produce from the farmers, built flatboats and shipped
                    it to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Mr. Andrews made frequent trips to that city, then the commercial
                    emporium for this and all the intervening territory.</p>
            <p>In those days flatboating was an important industry. Boats <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-012-1-083"/> were built at Point Commerce, loaded and sent to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Often twenty-five flatboat loads of pork, grain and other products
                    were shipped to the great southern metropolis in a single season.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Josephine Andrews tells us of an interesting event. Mr. Andrews went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> with an unusually heavy cargo of pork and grain, which he sold and
                    received his pay, several thousand dollars in silver and gold. He put his money
                    into a barrel and, accompanied by a trusted assistant, shipped it by boat to
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, with as little
                    display as possible, not caring to make known the contents of the barrel. But
                    one of them always stood guard, and both slept by the precious collection of
                    coin. On reaching <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the barrel of money was rolled into a wagon and hauled overland to
                    Point Commerce.</p>
            <p>In later years Messrs. Andrews and Barekman located at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Worthington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which fact will be given in a subsequent chapter.</p>
            <p>Though Allison &amp; Allison, merchants, pork-packers and shippers,
                    hotelkeepers and speculators, were the pioneers, other large stores and rival
                    merchants were soon located and all did a good business.</p>
            <p>Hogs and cattle were raised in great number then. They ran at large and it cost
                    little to feed them or to care for them. The cattle fattened on the range and
                    hogs upon the mast. Just before slaughtering them they were taken up and fed a
                    few weeks to make them "corn fed" by which their market value
                    was enhanced.</p>
            <p>Mr. W. G. Sanders' father, who had done a large business in raising
                    hogs, packed his own pork in later years and shipped it to market.</p>
            <p>Subsequently the hogs were driven to market on foot in big droves. Mr. W. G.
                    Sanders remembers when he went with his father who drove 600 to 700 fat hogs to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They were eight days on the way. The drovers were accompanied by
                    teams, ready to haul any fat swine which gave out on the way. When a wagon got a
                    load it went on ahead to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, left its hogs and then returned to meet the drove.</p>
            <p>Cattle were driven to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> or other markets in those early days.</p>
            <p>Drovers were usually men of considerable means and on returning from the cities
                    (where their cattle had been sold), with their money in saddle bags, they were
                    often waylaid and robbed by highwaymen <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-012-1-084"/> on
                    the lonely roads in the forests. Sometimes they put up for the night at some
                    wayside inn whose landlord was the head of a band of robbers and murderers. The
                    returning drover who fell into such hands never reached home and was never heard
                    from again. No Point Commerce drover ever met such a fate.</p>
            <p>However, in those days, before there were any daily or even weekly market
                    reports, many an unfortunate drover lost heavily and was driven into bankruptcy
                    by an unfortunate deal in swine, or through the dishonesty of some swindling
                    speculator in the large cities. Occasionally a local speculator lost heavily
                    upon hogs which he bought here and drove to some large city.</p>
            <p>Jack Newsom, who owned the land known as the "Peters'
                    Farm," now the property of Z. P. East, was among the pioneer
                    speculators who lost all he possessed through the dishonesty of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> packers to whom he sold hogs. Mr. Newsom had raised some of the
                    hogs, but the rest he bought from his neighbors. He paid them but received
                    nothing from the dishonest men to whom he sold. They told him that the
                    "market was down" and that they had suffered heavy losses. If
                    they bought from others on the same terms they did from Jack Newsom it is
                    difficult to see how they suffered any loss. It cost Jack Newsom 1,300 acres of
                    good land, now worth $125 per acre.</p>
            <p>The drovers forded the rivers and creeks enroute. The older residents of Point
                    Commerce remember when big droves of cattle forded, or swam, <geogName>White
                        river</geogName> on their long and tiresome journey to
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, or to
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Everything was cheap in those days. David S. Fulk remembers when his father,
                    Charles Fulk, raised corn, shelled it by hand and sold it for 16 cents,
                    delivered. Pork sold for 2l/2 cents net. Mr. Fulk's father sold a cow
                    for $8 and a good heifer for $3. With the money he bought
                    a steel plow and a pair of leather check lines. Land was worth $1.25
                    per acre. A man who wanted to "enter" land rode to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, paid $1.25 per acre and got a deed.</p>
            <p>John Stanley, a pioneer citizen of the Point Commerce community, used to raise
                    corn and hogs and ship his products to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> by flatboat. He built his own boat, loaded it with his own corn and
                    pork and acted as his own pilot and business manager.</p>
            <p>He cooked and lived on the boat as he floated down stream to the great southern
                    mart. On reaching <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> he would sell <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-012-1-085"/> the cargo,
                    retaining his cooking utensils, ropes, block and tackle, which he brought back
                    for the next trip.</p>
            <p>Once he sold a load of produce for $1,500 and received his money in
                    silver. This he put into a barrel, piled the ropes, pans and skillets in on top
                    of it and shipped it by boat to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There the barrel, with its valuable contents, was stored in a
                    ware-room and left. There the barrel stood, with no one to guard it; no one knew
                    what the barrel contained.</p>
            <p>Mr. Stanley walked to Point Commerce, took his four-horse team and drove to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, loaded his barrel into the wagon with a quantity of merchandise he
                    had bought and returned. On reaching home Mr. Stanley unloaded his barrel,
                    dumped its contents upon the barn floor, and lo! his bags of money
                    were there, safe and untouched. He hid his money in some
                    "gums" of seed wheat, where it lay for several months, until
                    Mr. Stanley invested it in land. There were no banks near and as no one but the
                    owner knew that the money was there it was safe.</p>

            <p rend="center">AN ECHO FROM THE ERA OF THE TASSEMENTS.</p>
            <p>A contribution to the December number of the Indiana Magazine of History,
                    entitled "The Meaning of Tassinong," invites the undersigned
                    to present his authority for applying the old French word <hi rend="i">tassement</hi> to the simple log structures of old French trading posts, or
                    palisaded shops, where furs were obtained from the Indians in exchange for
                    various articles of trade. I take pleasure in responding to the invitation
                    contained in that article, especially since I have been indebted to its author,
                    in past years, for kindly and valuable aid on more than one difficult point in
                    Indiana's ancient history. I waive the fact that the invitation is
                    presented in a manner to which I am little accustomed, and I attribute the
                    author's playfulness in part to the freedom of an old-time
                    acquaintance.</p>
            <p>For critical purposes relating to French historical and literary matters of old
                    time, I find the work of Celestin Hippeau (1803-1883) indispensable; for it
                    seeks to do what has not been done by any other lexicographer of the language,
                    so far as I know. It seeks to give the status, in centuries gone, of old French
                    words, and to condense in two volumes of convenient size the substance of great
                    works which are rare, expensive, and inconvenient; to give what the student
                    would otherwise have to search for in the Dictionaries of Roquefort, De Burguy,
                    and Du Cagne, and in various partial lexicons.</p>
            <p>The first volume of Hippeau's work was issued in 1866; the second, in
                    1873. The work was published in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> by Auguste Aubry, of 18 Rue Seguier, who issued also seventeen
                    other volumes of historical, literary and educational criticism (all remarkable)
                    by Hippeau, together with seven valuable literary compends by him.</p>
            <p>In the second volume of Hippeau's <hi rend="i">Dictionnaire</hi> on
                    page 132, is found the word <hi rend="i">tassement</hi>, it being in the class
                    of words which had come into use before the close of the thirteenth century. It
                    is, therefore, at least, over six hundred years old, and it is still in use, <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-012-1-087"/> with no change in the spelling or in the
                    pronunciation, and still relates in a way to buildings (with a technical meaning
                    known especially to architects), though the old palisades have passed away.</p>
            <p>To this word our historical lexicographer gives but a single meaning. He defines
                    it <hi rend="i">palissade</hi>.</p>
            <p>Hippeau connects the word with <hi rend="i">tas, tasse</hi>, or <hi rend="i">tassel</hi>, meaning, as he says, <hi rend="i">rassemblement, assemblage de
                        plusieurs objets</hi>; also (a peculiar usage, I think) <hi rend="i">touffe
                        d'arbres</hi>. Tassement has been associated by others with <hi rend="i">tas, tasque</hi>, and <hi rend="i">tasche</hi>, meaning a pocket or
                    a sack or purse carried at the belt. The pocket or swung purse of the workman or
                    housewife, in centuries gone, contained many articles not now carried around in
                    clothing. Hence <hi rend="i">tassement</hi>, it would seem, came to convey the
                    idea of an assortment of serviceable things, such as were to be found in a
                    trader's establishment. But the idea of a palisade was the first and
                    dominant one expressed by the word, and our lexicographer gives no other meaning
                    than this.</p>
            <p>When the Count de St. Chamas (a native of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>, long resident at the court of Cairo, with whom I sustained an
                    intimate acquaintance for a decade in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>) was about to start, seven years ago, upon his journey around the
                    world, he came to me and gave me, as a parting present (the last of many
                    generous gifts), the great <hi rend="i">Grammaire des Grammaires</hi> and the
                    two volumes of Hippeau's <hi rend="i">Dictionnaire</hi>. Of the
                    latter he said, "I give these to you, <hi rend="i">mon ami</hi>,
                    because I know that you will appreciate them and use them." He had
                    often seen me ransacking Larousse and La Grande Encyclopedie.</p>
            <p>Where were the tassements of the French in the third century back? The greatest
                    line of tassements in history (with which Hippeau was so familiar) was the line
                    built from Quebec to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The scanty records remaining tell of the more prominent of these; but there must
                    have been, in the colonial period, many a modest <hi rend="i">tassement</hi> of
                    French traders all unknown to fame, and hundreds of crudely-drawn maps or
                    tracings of routes that were never engraved for books or even copied in enduring
                    manuscripts. The heroic colonial age of the west was largely characterized by
                    individual daring, enterprise, endurance and achievement, unrecorded, <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-012-1-088"/> and lost even to family legend and popular
                    tradition by the changes of sovereignty and of population.</p>
            <p>What remains, even of vague, dim legend, should be treasured, especially where it
                    is fortified very strongly by the evidence which a perpetuated name supplies.</p>
            <p>The writer of the December contribution mentioned above seeks to derive the name
                    "Tassinong" from an Indian word meaning plum, and presents the
                    matter ingeniously. Such a derivation would involve the substitution of the
                    sound of "n" for that of "m" (which I do not
                    regard as a serious matter); but it presents other phonetic difficulties, which
                    to me seem to be of a serious nature.</p>
            <p>That writer's opinion is entitled to respectful consideration; but it
                    seems to ignore the following facts, to say nothing of the inherent probability
                    that some modest <hi rend="i">tassement</hi> of an early French trader, unknown
                    to fame, existed in the neighborhood of Tassinong in the old French days (a
                    probability that does not appeal to the contributor) :</p>
            <list type="ordered">
               <item>The fact that the tradition of the place, often told by the early
                        settlers, and by them received from the Indians, was that a very old French
                        trading establishment had existed there, of which not a splinter remained.</item>
               <item>The fact that a word such as the French spelled <hi rend="i">tassement</hi>, varied perhaps in a single small particular (by the
                        exchanging of an "m" sound for an "n"
                        sound), was orally handed down through generations of Indians (who were in
                        no way chargeable with the spelling, since they did not write the word, but
                        only spoke it).</item>
               <item>The fact that the earliest settlers, having acquired the very old name
                        orally, from the Indians, gave its final syllable the French nasal sound
                        (pronouncing "nong" as a very nasal
                        "naw," and thrusting out their lips in the effort), to the
                        later amusement of their children and grandchildren.</item>
               <item>The fact that "Grove" was not a part of the Indian name,
                        and was probably used only informally and by only a very few persons. I
                        never heard of it before in this connection.</item>
               <item>The fact that the minor <hi rend="i">tassements</hi> of the French did not
                        always have names. Even <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                        </placeName> was long known simply as the "Poste," having
                        no other name.</item>
               <item>The fact that the more modest palisades would not likely be spoken of as
                            <hi rend="i">postes</hi> (which would denote an official character), <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-012-1-089"/> but would more naturally be called by
                        another and more generic name. Probably the legendary trading house at <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Tassinong</settlement>
                        </placeName> was wholly a private affair, and never had any official
                        designation (or character, other than the license of the trader would
                        presuppose if he had one). <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Duluth</settlement>
                        </placeName>, I learn, had neither a license nor a name for his <hi rend="i">tassement</hi> in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                        </placeName>.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Since the Indians who transmitted the old name orally were not responsible for
                    the spelling of "Tassinong" (which bears the earmarks of some
                    one who understood the old conventional English rendering of the French syllable
                    "ment"), that counts for little.</p>
            <p>The principles of French syllabication are so well established that I should not
                    think of arguing them. When any one tells me that French words like <hi rend="i">tassement, nullement, tellement</hi>, etc., etc., have but two syllables, I
                    respectfully refer him to a competent professor of French.</p>
            <p>In dealing with a light French syllable, Americans either fortify it or else
                    ignore it. It may be remarked that "Tassinong" (unlike
                    Prattville, which must be pronounced in two syllables, or Calumet, which must be
                    pronounced in three) happens to contain a resonant liquid, the sound of
                    "n"; and while I have been familiar with the name from
                    babyhood, I could scarcely tell now, in hundreds of cases, whether the speaker
                    using it is making one or two syllables of it. Happily, the oral pronunciation
                    handed down presents no problem of syllables, at all.</p>
            <p>In my preceding paper I did not urge the antecedent and inherent probability that
                    the hunters' and trappers' paradise in my native county of
                    Porter, north of the Kankakee, on the route taken by the first recorded
                    incursion of the French into Indiana (La Salle's, 1679) should
                    contain, within the French period, at least a modest and unnamed tassement. Yet
                    this did appeal very strongly to a gentleman well acquainted with Smithsonian
                    work in archaeology, and well posted in our colonial history, who took me to
                    task somewhat severely, several years ago, for not making an effort to locate
                    such a trading establishment. So strongly was he impressed with the inherent
                    probability of its one-time existence (though he knew nothing at all of
                    Tassinong), that he was concerned only as to its location. I looked, in Hippeau,
                    for tassement, as an original form for the conventionalized
                    "Tassinong," and found it with the mutation of a single
                    letter, in <hi rend="i">tassement</hi>.</p>
            <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-012-1-090"/>
            <p>My purpose has not been to attempt anything sensational, but, as a conscientious
                    duty, to contribute what I might of historical criticism relating to the region
                    north of the Kankakee, so much neglected by writers of Indiana history. I
                    presumed that the distinguished writer of the December contribution was
                    acquainted with Hippeau and perhaps also with the <hi rend="i">Dictionaries</hi>
                    of De Burguy, Roquefort, and Du Cange, which Hippeau so cleverly epitomized for
                    our convenience.</p>
            <p>While I perhaps had no right to assume this of so busy a gentelman, and may have
                    overestimated his acquaintance with authorities on old French, it would be
                    difficult for any one to overestimate his painstaking diligence in arresting the
                    influence of impudent or careless historical impositions, and in sifting the
                    great mass of materials, often very perplexing, which he has handled. Perhaps it
                    is not to be wondered at that his feelings cause him, at times, to make use of
                    exclamation points, and to demand facts and authorities in a somewhat
                    undiplomatic way.</p>
            <p>I am delighted to learn from him that the name "Tassinong"
                    still appears on recent maps of Porter county. I hope it will long remain.
                    Unless it shall be discovered elsewhere in current cartography, I shall be glad
                    to feel that Porter county possesses, in a conventionalized form, the last
                    remaining cartographic use of a name so full of heroic and romantic
                    suggestiveness as attaches to the word <hi rend="i">tassement</hi> in old and
                    historic French.</p>

               <hi rend="i">George Washington: Farmer, Being An Account of His Home Life and
                        Agricultural Activities.</hi> By P<hi rend="sc">AUL</hi> L<hi rend="sc">ELAND</hi> H<hi rend="sc">A</hi>-<hi rend="sc">WORTH</hi>. The

            <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> first question to suggest itself on reading the above
                    title was What can a serious historian do with such a subject? Fortunately a
                    reading of the book settles the question. The author has done at least four
                    things and avoided doing one which has brought considerable notoriety to less
                    sensible authors. The author has held strictly to the fundamental principles of
                    good history writing. The whole account is based on a first hand study of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s own papers; he has produced a valuable commentary on
                    the labor question, the problems of farming, the problem of good living, the
                    social customs, and commercial conditions of that period; he has given us a new
                    angle on the life of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>; he has produced a very readable book; and finally he has not given
                    us one of the modern "real" biographies by dipping into every
                    trace of scandal handed down by the gossips of the times.</p>
            <p>The account is concrete and descriptive. There are no opinions advanced, no
                    theories set forth and argued at length. There is an atmosphere of reality
                    preserved throughout. The author naturally has a snappy style, and the numerous
                    expressions picked up from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s own pen help to keep one on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName> premises at all times. Some of the chapters are "Building
                    an Estate", "<placeName>

                    Soil", "The Stockman", "White Servants and
                    Overseers", "Black Slaves", "A
                    Farmer's Amusements", "Profit and Loss".
                    The reader cannot escape believing that the author enjoyed browsing among the
                    voluminous papers of General Washington. There is no evidence anywhere of that
                    musty, dutsy, grind by which some writers make a living browsing through
                    repulsive material hoping here and there to find a pay lead. Being a robust,
                    red-blooded Hoosier farmer himself, he certainly enjoyed the long visits with
                    "Our Farmer" as he rode from farm to farm, or chased the
                    foxes, or cursed lazy negroes, or tried to raise bumper crops on worn out <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-012-1-092"/> land, or whiled away the wintry hours
                    studying "Hoil." The fortunate thing about the whole affair is
                    that he can take any reader who has any appreciation for farm life with him on
                    these trips, so that he gets an idea of the great general not easily obtained
                    elsewhere. The finest thing in the whole book is the testimony the author bears
                    to the character of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It seems that every new discovery, as he studied the Farmer day by
                    day, increased his regard.</p>

            <p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> is a preliminary study to a history of the Whigs of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. The five chapter heads: Genesis of the Illinois Whigs; The
                    Emergence of the Whig party, 1834-1839; Harrison and Tyler, 1839-1841; Sectional
                    and State Issues, 1841-1845; and The Illinois Whigs and National Politics,
                    1841-1845, show fairly accurately the field the author has examined. From
                    another point of view the study seems to fall into three sections; the period of
                    personal politics, the period of State politics, and the period when national
                    issues dominated the field. Each of these periods developed its characteristic
                    men. Governor Edwards built tip a strong personal following, the men of the
                    second period built up sectional follow-ings, depending for their cohesion on
                    local interest. This was the period of bank and internal improvement
                    legislation. In the third <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-012-1-093"/> period men of
                    national significance were developed. Dr. Thompson has not developed this idea
                    extensively but has gone perhaps as far as the facts would warrant. He has
                    wisely refrained from the sweeping generalization which historians are
                    constantly tempted to make.</p>
            <p>The study is most significant for Indiana. Our party history is almost a
                    counterpart of that of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Indiana had its Jennings as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> had its Edwards; Indiana had its experience in Internal
                    Improvements backed up largely by the Whig party, but really a non-partisan
                    movement; the Indiana Supreme Court was attacked by politicians at the same time
                    as that of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. The author's description of the Harrison Campaign if a
                    few names were changed would do for the campaign in Indiana. The charge of
                    scandal against <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> and Adams was made in one state the same as the other. Indiana had
                    the same conflict between the northern and southern parts of the state, though
                    not so acute as in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. The opposition to Jackson and Van Buren crystallized into the Whig
                    party in Indiana about the same time and in about the same way as in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. The Jacksonian party in 1824 found its strongest weapon in
                    denouncing officeholders. The Whig party was evidently much stronger in Indiana
                    as early as 1832 and certainly in 1836 conducted a well organized campaign
                    carrying the State.</p>
            <p>The study is a good one, well written, based on what seems sufficient data. The
                    wide use of the newspapers of the period is especially to be commended. above
                    all it is encouraging to see such men as Dr. Thompson devoting their time to the
                    history of the middle period of the West. It is certainly one of the most
                    profitable fields in our history for investigation.</p>

                    the Indians of the Wea Towns in 1791. These traditions are to the effect that a
                    battle was fought on the hills opposite Attica at the same time Scott destroyed
                    the Wea Towns. It is suggested that this may refer to the battle between Colonel
                    John Hardin and the Indians. In his official report General Scott says he
                    detached Colonel Hardin with sixty men to attack some villages to his
                    left–that is, down the river. Hardin executed the order but after

                    but that they were circumvented by Zachariah Cicot, the half-breed guide of
