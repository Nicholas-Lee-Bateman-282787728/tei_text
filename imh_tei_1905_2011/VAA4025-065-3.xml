                    <geogName>River</geogName> immediately associated this word with visions of gold strewn valleys and
                    mountains. Nuggets covered the ground; riches were there for the taking. For these dreamers El
                    Dorado lay just west of the <geogName>Rocky Mountains</geogName>. Soon, however, disillusioning news
                    filtered back east to dispel the popular mythology about <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. The gold rush eventually became more rush than gold.</p>
            <p>The following letters of Ephraim Thompson reflect this disenchantment with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>

                    the West. His letters vividly describe his journey to <placeName>

                    </placeName> via a land-water route across Nicaragua, mining techniques in the Golden State, and

                    influenced his decision.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> In addition, attractive broadsides put out by the
                    Nicaraguan Steamship Company, advertising their service to be the "Shortest, Quickest and

                    that surrounded the city. But slavery, Thompson wrote, was the "one thing" that

                    shallow rivers. Unfortunately, he wrote nothing more on the efficiency of the commodore's
                    operations; for shortly after Thompson journeyed across Nicaragua, William Walker's

                    The town was "about as large as New A[l]bany [Indiana] and not very well built up at

                        <region type="county">Daviess County</region>

                    had noted in 1850, contained "the hardest set of 'hombres' …
                    in this country. Every night gambling, drinking, fighting and shooting are carried on to a great

                    told his father that the gold region was "a hard place to do wright. gaming and drinking

                    provision the miners. Thompson sought work as a clerk but confided to his brother that "you

                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>

                    hardest work that Mortal man ever done." Farming was "fun" by comparison.</p>
            <p>Thompson grew progressively more discouraged with each letter home. On February 1, 1854, he decided
                    he could never settle in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> and would try to earn enough money to leave within two years. By May he was checking
                    the steamers going cast even though he had finally landed a job as a clerk. By July Thompson warned
                    his brother to give up any notion of coming to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. "Before leaving home," he advised, <placeName>

                    </placeName> "Seems like a golden dream, where a feller dont wake up untill he finds
                    himself out of money and digging in mud and watter to make enough to buy Gr[u]b." It was
                    better to stay in Indiana, he concluded.</p>
            <p>Within the year Thompson raised enough money to return to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Daviess County</region>
                    </placeName> where he entered the general merchandise business with his brother, Joseph. Later he
                    operated a carpet store and served as president of the <placeName>

                    of cancer in 1906.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> In his gold rush letters he wrote a vivid description of his
                    own experiences, perhaps hoping that they might serve as a deterrent to other young men who had not
                    "stopped bu[i]lding Castles in the air." Yet, in spite of the difficulties young

                    </placeName> youths tried their luck prospecting. Unfortunately, no contemporary accounts disclose
                    the number of Hoosiers who did trek west, but Thompson's letters hint that many did so and

                                 <hi rend="sup">1</hi> In editing these letters an effort has been made to
                                            maintain, as closely as possible, the flavor imparted to them by
                                            Thompson's own spelling, grammar, punctuation, and style. Thus,
                                            lapses in spelling and grammar have been retained as long as the meaning
                                            remained clear. Thompson often dropped letters from words; these missing
                                            letters have been added only where clarity dictated. In a few instances
                                            words and punctuation marks have also been added in brackets to clarify
                                            meaning. The occasional use of a capital letter in the middle of a sentence
                                            has been maintained. Where no punctuation occurs at the end of a sentence,
                                            Thompson occasionally left a space. These spaces have also been maintained.
                                            However, in those cases where it has been impossible to determine which mark
                                            was intended, modern usage has prevailed. Raised letters have been lowered
                                            to the line. Paragraphing has been standardized as has spacing on headings,
                                            salutations, and closings. Obviously unintentional repetitions have been
                                            omitted. Some decisions regarding punctuation, capitalization, paragraphing,
                                            spelling, and sentence structure were necessarily arbitrary. Efforts to
                                            identify the people mentioned in the letters have been unsuccessful.</item>

                                    for Board, but we intend moving into a Cabin as Soon as wee find diggins. we have

                                            miners so that they could write home an illustrated account of their life in

                                    gowing And I hope Bro. Edward and William will be content with [it] for it is the
                                    best way to live in any Country, it does not Seem to me that I have been away from
                                    home more than a month or two and I can hardly realize that things have changed So
                                    mutch Scince I left So many persons of My acquanetane have died, but I was more
                                    Supprised to hear of Mr. Fronks death, he looked So well and hearty the day we left
                                    that I did not think of Sutch a thing. I reed, a letter from G[e]o. Fronk a few

                                    at Jeferson Ranch and is doing well Geo. Says he thinks he will Start for home this
                                    fall a year John Fronk will return home this fall there is a great many going home

                                    have money to come home on but I think I can make enough for that if I keep my

                        <p>I have obtaned through the influance of Ro[b]t Perkins a Situation in a provision

                                    and maby I will Stay with him all Summer. I have not Seen any of the Duncan Boys for
                                    more than a month Since we quit mining together. Wm I think is at Cold Springs yet

                                    that he will come home this fall if he can get off—this is the best

                                    take that than run the risk of loosing all of it. he has another Claim in the River
                                    that he wants to work as Soon as the watter falls low enough to put in a floom. a

            <p>Until the appearance in 1964 of Irwin Unger's <hi rend="i">The Greenback Era: A Social and
                        Political History of American Finance, 1865-1879</hi>, the significant contributions of Ezra A.
                    Olleman to the origins and early successes of the Independent Greenback party movement had been
                    largely overlooked. Histories and descriptions of farmer agitation in the 1870s either gave
                    perfunctory, or even erroneous, information about Olleman or made no mention of him at all.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The political ignominy that shadowed the latter part of his life and the
                    destruction of his personal papers contributed heavily to his obscurity.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Now
                    Olleman emerges both as a prime mover in early Greenback party politics and as an important
                    formulator of positions taken by the greenbackers in their quest for the economic equality of
                    farmers, businessmen, and labor groups.</p>
            <p>The greenback agitation which reached its peak in Indiana in the 1870s had its roots deep in
                    underlying economic changes which occurred in the state in the third quarter of the nineteenth
                    century. Pioneer practices crumbled rapidly during the generally prosperous 1850s when roughly 2,000
                    miles of railroad track were laid, increasing the aggregate from a scanty 228 miles in 1850 to 2,163
                    a decade later. Railroad expansion was almost entirely halted during the Civil War, but by 1875 the
                    total mileage had jumped to nearly 4,000.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> As this railroad network spread over
                    nearly all sections of Indiana, through lines developed between the Old Northwest and the Middle
                    Atlantic-New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> area. These lines fostered economic ties between East and West as Indiana became much

                    money, as did this revolutionary development in land transportation.</p>
            <p>Though agriculture remained by far the dominant economic pursuit, revolutionary changes were emerging
                    in it as in other segments of the economy. Farmers became increasingly dependent upon improved and
                    new machinery for the plowing, cultivation, and harvesting of their crops. Meanwhile, manufacturing
                    based on agriculture and lumbering advanced rapidly coupled with a growth in the number and size of
                    towns. These and related changes resulted in expanding and widening markets, an increased role for
                    merchants and wholesalers, and an augmented importance for money and monetary institutions.</p>
            <p>A bewildering succession of changes also occurred in the conduct of banking. In 1850 this segment of
                    the economy was dominated by the branches of the Second State Bank of Indiana, but in 1852 free or
                    general banking was instituted. As free banking became established during the fifties, a so-called
                    Third State Bank, privately owned, replaced the Second State Bank which expired in 1859. Before
                    Hoosiers became adjusted to these changes, the federal government added national banks during the
                    Civil War. The national banking system soon either absorbed or ended the branches of the Third State
                    Bank. At about the same time a federal tax on state bank notes caused the withdrawal of such notes
                    from the currency. These frequent and fundamental changes caused much uncertainty, concern, and
                    widespread disagreement among people and politicians alike.</p>
            <p>Changes in the Hoosier economy were much affected by the Civil War and the ups and downs of the
                    business cycle. The war disrupted trade with the South, increased reliance on farm machinery,
                    stimulated manufacturing, strengthened east-west economic ties, augmented the role of money and
                    banks, and brought a rapid inflation of prices. This inflation partially resulted from the issuance
                    by the federal government of about $430,000,000 in fiat greenback currency to help
                    finance the conflict.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> The farmers of the Middle West were hard hit by the
                    postwar deflation of the last half of the sixties and early seventies, especially those who had
                    unpaid debts contracted during inflation. Meantime, once the war ended, the federal government began
                    to withdraw greenbacks from circulation. Immediate objection arose to the contraction of this fiat
                    currency as well as to the fact that some obligations to the federal government could not be
                    extinguished by them. To numerous farmers it seemed obvious that a shortage of currency was a, if
                    not even the, primary source of their economic squeeze, hence they either opposed contraction of
                    greenbacks or urged an expansion of them. Even though this smouldering discontent was deeply rooted
                    in such factors as increased dependency on railroad rates and services, payments to merchants <list type="footnotes">

                    charges, the impact of the postwar deflation fostered a continuous emphasis and growing concern
                    about the monetary situation. When the extreme deflation arising from the severe and prolonged
                    depression of the seventies descended, the greenback agitation soared to its all time high.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                    local farmer, on August 16, 1849. They were to have five children. Olleman left his craft in 1852,
                    establishing himself as a merchant in Waverly, some miles south of <placeName>

            <p>By 1858 Olleman had achieved a degree of prosperity. In that year he sold his business and moved to

            <p>Olleman invented and developed a wide variety of farm implements. He had patents on such items as a
                    goose neck hoe, a rolling gate, a clevis, a screw pulverizer (pulled by six mules), a harrow, and
                    similar apparatus. He sold the patents, however, before he made any money on them. As a result of
                    high expenditures, experimental farming, costly inventions, and lavish entertainment, Olleman
                    profited little from farming. Although Willow Brook Farm continued to be productive, Olleman
                    seemingly failed to reinvest in the enterprise. On numerous occasions in the late 1860s and in the
                    1870s he sold parcels of farm land for cash.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> At one time he speculated on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Board of Trade, losing much money. Nevertheless, Olleman was considered a modern and
                    prosperous farmer by his contemporaries. The income from his enterprises and land sales would later
                    be used for political purposes.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A self-educated man and an avid reader, Olleman was said to have the largest private library in the
                    area. He was a strong willed individual who was determined that his position prevail. Unable to
                    compromise at crucial times, Olleman was "hot-headed" and unwilling to see the
                    other person's viewpoint.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> These characteristics would later
                    alternately create advantages and problems for the greenback movement.</p>
            <p>According to Olleman's own account, he became interested in politics during the early 1850s.
                    Indeed, several years later he claimed that he and "about a score of others" met
                    around 1854 at the Indiana State House to organize the Republican party in the state.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> The Civil War interrupted his political activities; for in the summer of 1862, at the
                    age of thirty-six, Olleman enlisted in and recruited volunteers for Company D, Seventieth Indiana
                    Volunteer Infantry headed by Benjamin Harrison. The loss of an eye resulted in his discharge with
                    the rank of first sergeant in January, 1863. By 1864, then, Olleman had been farmer, cattle driver,
                    cabinet maker, merchant, <list type="footnotes">

                    committees on education and agriculture, Olleman's activities in the regular session of the
                    Indiana General Assembly early in 1865 and in the special session later that year anticipated his
                    future concern about high salaries and fees of state officials, increased interest rates, railroad
                    and toll road monopolies, educational facilities, and state circuit courts. A watchdog over charges
                    and expenditures concerning government, Olleman fought additional reimbursement by the state
                    government of parties involved in legal cases. His motions to reduce the salary of the president of
                    the state sinking fund commissioners and to reduce examiners' fees for certification of
                    teachers in the public schools and licenses for railroad engineers were tabled. He supported
                    postponement of the establishment of separate Negro schools and opposed a bill to provide a new
                    judicial circuit to include <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan County</region>
                    </placeName>, as he "was not aware that the bill was demanded, so far as his district was
                    concerned." New state sinking fund bonds were issued at 7 per cent
                    interest—Olleman wanted 5 per cent.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Olleman's greatest interest was in the field of transportation—roads and
                    railroads. He opposed a toll increase on turnpikes: "these plank and gravel roads were
                    originally constructed by the people along their lines, and had been chiefly sold to capitalists. As
                    a director of a road, and a farmer, he hoped the House would not consent to nearly double the tolls
                    for the benefit of new owners." The bill was tabled in the regular session, then rejected
                    in the special session.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> His bill to allow toll free turnpikes was referred to
                    committee but not acted upon.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> More successful was Olleman's bill to
                    force certain railroads which had not been completed and which had had no work done in ten years to
                    forfeit their branch road rights of way. These would then revert to the original owners. Olleman
                    argued that failure of one railroad to develop its line along the <geogName>White River</geogName>

                    the Republican nomination for auditor of the state. In fact, he held no significant position within
                    the Republican party save his one term in the state legislature, and this despite his many
                    contributions to the party. Later Olleman would be bitter: "I accepted the nomination for
                    the State Legislature solely for the benefit of the party, and served at another pecuniary loss [the
                    first losses being money and an eye for serving in the Union army]. So have I contributed time and
                    money in every canvas, and I confess … I am growing weary in welldoing."<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Personal political frustrations and general economic difficulties after 1872
                    appear to have caused Olleman to take up the financial question of the day, soft money versus hard

            <p>It is not difficult to understand Olleman's support of greenbackism. He
                    believed—and probably many of his neighbors agreed—that the gradual
                    contraction of the currency was responsible for low farm prices. Even before the Panic of 1873 the

            <p>Despite growing demands for currency modification, the party politicians found it difficult to decide
                    which side of the money question was safest. From their soft money, national bank policy during the
                    Civil War, Republicans by 1876 were stalwart defenders of hard money. Democrats, on the other hand,
                    moved from contraction to increased greenback circulation. But these statements indicate only the
                    very general trend in party positions, for each party at national and state levels had its hard and
                    soft money factions which fluctuated in power in the decade after the Civil War. For the American

                    party politics. The inconsistency of the two major parties seemingly created a vacuum into which
                    stepped Olleman and the Independent Greenback party.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What may have been Olleman's first important public pronouncement on the financial issue
                    appeared in the <hi rend="i">North-Western Farmer</hi> in February, 1873, seven months before the
                    panic of that year. Written as a letter to the editor, the article observed that agricultural
                    profits had been gradually diminishing, a circumstance which to the farmer made a "rigid
                    economy imperative to make … accounts balance." Olleman expressed sentiments on
                    behalf of farmers who had little to show from long hours of labor: "As a class, farmers are
                    certainly entitled to a fair share of the profits of the general business of the country, for they
                    certainly perform more hours of labor during the year than any other profession
                    …." According to Olleman two things were causing hardships, not only to the
                    farmer, but also to "the entire industry of the country": railroad monopolies and
                    insufficient currency. Railroad monopolies with unlimited power fixed "their own tariff of
                    freights, enabling them to become vast sources of oppression …." The decrease of
                    circulating medium had caused a steady price decline since 1870 and an increased demand for money
                    had brought about higher, "ruinous" interest rates which "must inevitably
                    result disastrously" unless the country found "speedy relief." The money
                    lender had grasped too much of the country's profits while Indiana had become
                    "plated over with 12 per cent, mortages …."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The farmer and the businessman preferred cash, Olleman continued, not credit. The development of the
                    nation called for an expanding currency, not contraction. "The currency must be increased,
                    or labor and every product of the country [must] seek still lower values to adjust themselves to the
                    given amount of currency." Recent <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Treasury action would make producers poorer and money lenders richer, resulting in
                    "the necessary decline in all products." Following that, ruin would "have
                    come to many a home and general disaster have swept over … [the] country." To
                    Olleman, sustaining the two billion dollar national debt and continuing to underwrite the prosperity
                    of certain industries by contraction would reduce the price of labor and products.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To avoid these conditions, "a judicious, reasonable increase" in the volume of
                    currency would correspond to the increases in population and the wants of the country. Olleman would
                    "leave resumption to come in after years as a natural result without trying to force it
                    …." Like other farmers in the West, he found it difficult to break completely
                    from specie circulation. Olleman <list type="footnotes">

                    which had been "exciting so much interest among the farmers throughout the

                    while unsigned, were flavored with demand, seasoned with his views on money, monopoly,
                    transportation, and business—-which was the stated purpose of his
                    editorship—and not at all subtle.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> He opposed congressmen who
                    catered to party, not constituent, interests; favored honest, faithful men; resented eastern
                    dominance of the national government; and insisted that Congress aid the unemployed. He demanded
                    that Congress control through common carrier laws the vast railroad monopolies with their exorbitant
                    rates; proposed that the national government open up and improve internal waterways for products to
                    reach the oceans, causing cheap water transportation and forcing railroad rates down; and asked for
                    increased pensions for veterans. Olleman further demanded that Congress provide an "elastic
                    currency" by exchanging greenbacks for interest bearing bonds "and <hi rend="i">vice verse [sic]</hi>, at the option of the holder so that business … [would]
                    regulate the currency, not a fixed currency regulate business, thus lowering the rates of interest
                    to correspond, to some extent, with the shrunken values of the labor and products of the
                    country." He preferred that money and business work together naturally: government would
                    provide reasonable laws, and the American economy would reach a realistic and prosperous level. He
                    also demanded that Congress repeal the 1873 coinage act and a recently voted congressional pay
                    increase with its retroactive clause.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of particular importance was Olleman's bid to end the north-south sectional animosity
                    remaining from the Civil War and reconstruction. He wanted congressmen from the West, South, and
                    Northwest to "defend and maintain the rights of their constituents" from the
                    influence of eastern financial circles.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> He also aimed at farm and labor
                    support of a program of currency and government reform: the farmer, to pay debts and secure a fair
                    price and profit from his produce; the workingman, to gain a fair wage and buy the products of the
                    nation. Olleman concluded that the way to assure the success of his proposed program was to
                    extricate the people of the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> from the influence of eastern
                    financial interests. This theme would appear repeatedly, but endorsed by others more powerful than
                    Olleman, throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

            <p>As a Grange master and delegate, Olleman persuaded the annual Indiana State Grange meeting in
                    November, 1873, to support the proposition that the Grange "patronize home manufactures,
                    home merchants and mechanics … and thereby build up home interests" and home
                    markets. In addition, <list type="footnotes">

                    and financial situation and declared itself against the existing banking system. Olleman also
                    persuaded the organization to come out for fewer state officers, no salary increases for public
                    officials, and no public support of colleges. On these and other matters Olleman wielded a powerful
                    influence to win farmer support for the greenback cause.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> were supporting greenbackism to resuscitate business and revive full employment. From
                    these meetings emerged the Indiana Plan which would be the keystone for the Greenback party and
                    which adhered closely to Olleman's public letter of February, 1873. The plan blamed the
                    1873 panic and subsequent economic distress on "insufficient money." Forced specie
                    payment would be ruinous; on the other hand, greenbacks, through congressional action,
                    "could be increased or diminished as business necessities required." The heart of
                    the plan was a special government bond paying 3 per cent interest which could be interchanged with
                    greenbacks. "If greenbacks were issued to excess, commercial interest rates would fall
                    below the bond rate and the legal tender would be withdrawn from circulation by bond purchases. Were
                    interest rates to exceed 3 per cent because of an increased demand for money, the bonds would be
                    cashed and money would become available for loans."<hi rend="sup">38</hi> With this plan
                    interest rates would not rise too high or drop too low, and a "cheap, secure, and flexible
                    medium of circulation would be provided." Much credit for this plan has been given to <placeName>

                    </placeName> lawyer James Buchanan who, with his brother Thomas, was influential in the currency
                    question; but Olleman enunciated these basic positions before Buchanan rose to prominence in

                    of differences between the old parties, for neither offered "any remedy for
                    corruption." Yet the delegates were in a dilemma: whether to make the movement distinctly
                    one of farmers, growing out of the Grange, or "to make a general third party movement of

                    movement. They transformed what were virtually ephemeral elements of the 10th of June movement into
                    a successful state political party in the 1874 Indiana elections and a dismal national fiasco in the

                    independent paper, and it became the party's official organ. While using the <hi rend="i">Indiana Farmer</hi> to announce the convention, Olleman lashed out at other journals, saying
                    newspapers should report all the news, thereby affording the general public the benefit of honest
                    reporting. In other words, the independent movement was receiving a bad press—another
                    reason to begin publication of an independent newspaper.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> Until the fall
                    elections of 1876 Olleman devoted most of his energies to political organizing at state and national
                    levels and generally succeeded in preventing independents from returning to the older political
                    parties. Ironically, he would be charged with treachery when he tried to prevent a Democratic state
                    victory in 1876.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>

                    state convention had to fill vacancies in the nominations made by the 10th of June Convention and
                    establish a platform for the fall campaign. In a preconvention statement Olleman declared that the
                    Independent party favored the Indiana Plan and rejected national banks, gold brokers, bond holders,
                    and deflationary financial decisions by the national government. The <placeName>

                    currency situation, but also discourage land speculation and monopolies in transportation,
                    manufacturing, commerce, and grain. The platform also stated that taxes should be reduced to the
                    lowest possible rate, including an end to 10 per cent fees on certain legal transactions, and that
                    real estate assessment should be revised to unburden the "producing class." The
                    delegates resolved that the office seek the man, not the man the office. Finally, the convention

                    With the nominations filled and the platform proclaimed, Olleman had to organize an extremely loose
                    knit group into a workable, viable, somewhat successful party. The organization was so loose knit

            <p>Olleman and the Independents had become convinced that the old parties were dying or in the process
                    of destruction. They found evidence of such disintegration in the 1874 election, in support by some
                    prominent Americans of the Independent movement, in the success of the Independent party at local
                    levels, and in the growth of Greenback Clubs, particularly in Indiana. Reformer and former
                    abolitionist Wendell Phillips gave enthusiastic support to greenbackism, while adding some of his
                    own economic ideas. Independent local victories occurred in <placeName>

                    On the surface, it appeared the movement was "steadily coming to the front &amp;

                    presidential elector. He urged the formation and use of Greenback Clubs as the "best and
                    most rapid means of organizing the party." He did not, however, indicate that club
                    leadership could pave the way for future office. The delegates chose <placeName>

                    14, 1875, be repealed. Olleman obtained a resolution of thanks from the convention to the <placeName>

                    delegates to pay for convention expenses. The delegates gave thanks, not money.<hi rend="sup">76</hi> It was a successful yet fateful convention.</p>
            <p>Events in Indiana aroused national interest. Olleman had told the February state gathering that the
                    whole country would be watching the convention and its subsequent results. He was right. During the
                    fall campaign a letter from Ignatius Donnelly, editor of the <hi rend="i">Anti-Monopolist</hi>,
                    appeared in the <placeName>

                    <hi rend="i">Sun.</hi> The Independent vote in Indiana, said Donnelly, would "either
                    produce a revolution in our favor throughout the entire Northwest or it will destroy us.
                    … Let Indiana demonstrate that we can win." Admonishing Hoosiers to stand firm,
                    Donnelly declared that "Every Independent in Indiana who votes for the Democrats or
                    Republicans in October, puts the knife to the throat of reform." On Indiana, the home of
                    the Independent party, would rest the burden of success or failure.<hi rend="sup">77</hi>

                    Indiana Greenback statement in February, but it was at this gathering that the silver coinage issue
                    arose. At almost the last minute and "with great hesitation and reluctance," the
                    convention adopted a platform rejecting the demonetization of silver and demanding "the
                    payment of … coin obligations in either gold or silver at the option of the
                        government."<hi rend="sup">78</hi> Olleman was chosen for the national committee but

            </p>
            <p>Olleman's position within the party organization had fluctuated rapidly between September,
                    1875, and October, 1876. He was temporarily out as state chairman for three months prior to December
                    1, 1875; then, he was chairman again until after the February, 1876, state convention. Olleman had
                    again returned to the state chairmanship by August 12, 1876, just before the second state convention
                    of August 17. On the national committee Olleman had been chairman from November, 1874, to December,
                    1875. It would appear that he was forced to give way on the national committee to others,<hi rend="sup">80</hi> but his temperament would not allow such a maneuver without a fight. His name
                    reappeared on the committee rolls after the national convention in May, 1876, but he was not an
                    officer. From August to October, 1876, then, Olleman was Indiana state chairman, and from May to
                    October, a member of the national committee.<hi rend="sup">81</hi> Events soon gave probable reasons
                    for his fluctuating status.</p>

                    the state ticket (Anson Wolcott had already replaced Landers as nominee for governor).<hi rend="sup">82</hi> Olleman, again state chairman, made clear that the party was "a child of

                    in any capacity.</p>
            <p>Days before the state election on October 10, rumors spread that Olleman and Wolcott were guilty of
                    collusion, treachery, and a sellout. Wolcott, the Independent gubernatorial candidate, submitted his
                    letter of resignation to Olleman on October 4. In the letter he stated that he saw only futility in
                    the Independent campaign when so many stayed with the old parties, which of the two he himself
                    supported the Republican and its candidate Benjamin Harrison. Despite his resignation Wolcott
                    strongly maintained his support of greenback principles. Olleman attempted to keep the letter quiet.
                    Rumors, however, forced a rump meeting of the state committee, including the Buchanan brothers but
                    not Olleman. The purpose of the meeting, held on October 5, was to choose Wolcott's
                    successor. A member of the rump committee, Judge Henry W. Harrington, was hurriedly designated as
                    Wolcott's replacement.<hi rend="sup">85</hi> None of the members present at the rump
                    meeting had read Wolcott's letter, which was still in Olleman's possession. That
                    same evening, October 5, Olleman declared the meeting and its decisions null and void. The <hi rend="i">Sun</hi> on October 7 denied Wolcott's withdrawal from the election and
                    attempted to refute those who charged that the movement was "but a 'set up
                    job,'" a "decoy to turn the Republicans to the Democrats." These
                    charges greatly disturbed the Greenbackers, for they wanted voters from both parties, not to swing
                    voters from one old party to the other.<hi rend="sup">86</hi> The <hi rend="i">Sun's</hi>

                            Green-backers by nominating "Blue Jeans" Williams for governor. Since, it
                            was believed, the Independent party consisted of two thirds Democrats and one third
                            Republicans, at election day these Democrats would return to their old party, which had a
                            soft money candidate, while the Republicans would stay with the Independents, as the GOP did
                            not have a "soft" gubernatorial nominee in Benjamin Harrison. Considering
                            the narrow margin by which Williams won, the less than expected votes the Independents
                            received, and the earlier Buchanan-Green-Sun-Plan charges, the Greenbackers perhaps had some

                    followed the Democratic party. Both men agreed on economic principles and reform, using the
                    Independent Greenback party to put these ideas into effect. Earlier charges of collusion between
                    Buchanan and the Democrats may have rebounded to Olleman's dissatisfaction, for the
                    latter's own character and personality would not have tolerated a breach in the principles
                    for which he had fought since 1873. Olleman determined the course to be greenbacks and Independents,
                    not greenbacks, Independents, and the Democratic party. In withholding the announcement of
                    Wolcott's resignation, he seems to have intended to serve neither of the older parties.
                    Olleman had rigidly maintained his greenbackism but preferred a Republican victory to a Democratic
                        sellout.<hi rend="sup">92</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No evidence has been found nor have charges been substantiated that there was any bribery or
                    collusion involving Olleman. In fact, until the state elections of 1876, Olleman's name had
                    been free of suspicion. One Indiana historian calls the charges against Olleman and Wolcott
                    "gratuitous. It would have been foolish politics to try to buy out a ticket so near
                    election day."<hi rend="sup">93</hi> Had Olleman been able to guard the secrecy of the
                    letter, he and the party could possibly have weathered the storm, not necessarily hoping for
                    victory, but just keeping the ground won in 1874. His position, however, was undermined by the
                    rump's substitution. Thus, the old party ties were too strong to permit a sustained third
                    party movement, especially when it served "personal promotion," when collusion was
                    suspected, or when a major party such as the Democrats ran virtually on a greenback platform.
                    Olleman wanted only to serve the Independent party and its greenback principles.</p>
            <p>After 1876 Olleman disappeared from the political scene, and the political greenback movement died in
                    the 1880s. The stigma of party treachery had forced him into a less active role. Olleman sold his

                    sold for $9,600. Bankruptcy was complete with the public auction of farm equipment on

            <p>Olleman, during his participation in the greenback movement, had been a consistent supporter of soft
                    money. By his efforts through the <hi rend="i">Indiana Farmer</hi>, the Indiana Grange, and the <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Sun</hi>, Olleman became an early state leader of independent political action. In
                    print and in politics he was initially fundamental in formulating plans to lead his Hoosier
                    neighbors out of their economic difficulties and in placing Indiana in the vanguard of greenback
                    economics and politics in the nation. But others, such as James Buchanan, soon eclipsed him on
                    economic proposals. Olleman's organizational activities and the discontent of the people
                    resulted in some state election victories and in leading the National Independent Greenback party
                    through its initial birth pangs. Thus, despite others who, before and after 1873, had stated many of
                    the greenback views, Olleman is important because he was independent of both Republican and
                    Democratic parties—a true independent in this period—used the <hi rend="i">Indiana Farmer</hi> as the outlet for his views, and was influential in beginning the third
                    party movement, obstensibly an organization dedicated to these economic theories.</p>
            <p>At the height of his power, Olleman was a great influence in formulating and propagandizing greenback
                    principles, political action, and sectional cooperation. At his death in 1900 he was bankrupt and
                    forgotten by the history he helped shape. An irate Independent politician in October, 1876, had
                    remarked of Olleman and Wolcott, among others: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>One of the most controversial aspects of the history of the Republican party after the Civil War,
                    1865-1900, is its relationship to the southern Negro. The party, by its verbal pronouncements,
                    appeared to be the Negro's benefactor during the last quarter of the nineteenth century.
                    According to historian Vincent P. DeSantis, however, "the Republican party turned out to be
                    among the poorest friends that the southern Negro had after Reconstruction for while they talked
                    much they took few steps to remedy the situation or to meet their obligations to the
                    freedmen." Leslie H. Fishel contends that the great mistake of the Negro during this period
                    was to marry himself to the Republican party and to remain faithful to the marriage vows long after
                    the party had ceased its concern (1880) for him. Historians David Donald and Stanley P. Hirshon both
                    suggest that Republican party policy with regard to the Negro for the years 1877 to 1893 held that
                    the black man was inferior, politically undependable, and should be subordinated—not
                    abandoned—to a white dominated party in the South. Such a move, it was hoped, would
                    attract southern whites into the party and at the same time retain the Negro vote.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Whatever the validity of these scholars' contentions, identification of Republican
                    President Benjamin Harrison's reactions to racial matters should provide additional insight
                    into the dynamics of race adjustment after the Civil War.</p>
            <p>Harrison, as much as any other President, wrestled mightly with the Negro question.
                    Characteristically, most of what he had to say on matters of race was uttered in a political
                    context. He was well aware of race prejudice in the North and spoke of the "cruel shackles
                    of prejudice which bound every black man …" in that region.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                    During the presidential campaign of 1888 candidate Harrison spoke before three hundred Negroes of a

            <p>As the Republican presidential nominee, Harrison was faced with the problem of formulating a policy

                    settlement of that question preceded all others in natural order …. I would not be

            <p>Many letters urged Harrison to form a predominantly white man's Republican party in the

                    the South. In an interview granted approximately one month after Harrison's inauguration,
                    he spoke of the administration's "lack of vigor and courage in enforcing the

                    as to how long the issue of race would "continue to hang upon the skirts of
                    progress" in the South. He thought that economic interests should or could transcend racial
                    considerations and called for an alliance between Negroes and southern Whigs who favored the

                    position that the Negro problem should not be sidestepped: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>This generation should courageously face these questions, and not leave them as a heritage of
                            woe to the next. The consultation should proceed with candor, calmness, and great patience,
                            upon the lines of justice and humanity, not of prejudice and cruelty. No question in our
                            country can be at rest except upon the firm base of justice and the law.</p>
                    </quote> Harrison also rejected the popular theme that the southerners be allowed to work out the
                    Negro problem for themselves: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>If it be said that those [southern] communities must work out this problem for themselves we

                            under what conditions is the black man to have a free ballot? When is he in fact to have
                            those full civil rights which have so long been his in law? When is that equality of

                    </quote> Harrison had raised crucial questions, some of which await answers today. His talk was
                    plain and relatively uncluttered by political considerations. His statement that "the
                    colored man should be protected in all his relations to the federal government, whether as litigant,
                    juror, or witness in our courts, as an elector of members of Congress, or as a peaceful traveller
                    upon our interstate railways" reflected the omnipresence of the dual nature of the American
                    federal system as it was then regarded. Harrison implied that violation of <hi rend="i">intra</hi>state civil liberties was beyond the pale of federal competence or protection. He was
                    careful to stay away from anything which might imply that he was usurping state prerogative:
                    "No evil, however deplorable, can justify the assumption either on the part of the
                    Executive or of Congress of powers not granted, but both will be highly blameable if all the powers
                    are not wisely but firmly used to correct these." A stronger plea for the Negro would be
                    difficult to find in the presidential rhetoric of the period.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    and entrenchment in the national government, together with the inability of the government to
                    protect the rights of Negroes, with alarm. One of the most sensible and seemingly sincere letters on
                    the Southern Question was that of Emory Speer, a <placeName>

                    </placeName> born federal judge from the southern district of that state, calling for equal justice
                    before the law for the Negro in the South. In contrast to Speer, the Reverend Richard McIlwaine,
                    president of Hampden-Sidney College in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>

                    was inferior and unfit for the place he was seeking in American life.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the major themes of Harrison's campaign had been "a free and equal
                    ballot." He had noted that the nation in 1888 was protesting against the mistreatment of
                    the Jews by the Russians and the Irish by the English and asked why a little of that sympathy should
                    not go to the Negro in the South: "Should we not at least in reference to this gigantic and
                    intolerable wrong in our own country, as a party, lift up a stalwart and determined protest against
                    it?" In March, 1888, he told a <placeName>

                    "to make the constitutional grant of citizenship, the franchise to the colored man of the

            <p>The Negro public was also concerned about the question of voting in the South in 1888 and in some
                    quarters responded warmly to Harrison's interest in the subject. Upon his nomination in

                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> had congratulated the Republican standard bearer and urged him, in the words of
                    Congressman John R. Lynch, not to fail "to call attention to the criminal suppression of

                    their racial proclivities, Republican politicians could not forget that below Mason and
                    Dixon's line potential Republican ballots were being cast with increasing infrequency. Some
                    Americans seemed sincerely discomforted by southern prostitution of the ballot, the so-called
                    talisman of Greek, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon liberties. Harrison was one of them.</p>
            <p>During the first half of the year 1890, in the wake of attempts by various southern states to
                    disfranchise and segregate the Negro, interest in this aspect of the race problem was very high. The
                    subject was almost constantly before Congress and the public.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
                    Harrison's expressed interest in what he called a "pure" ballot for all
                    colors had culminated in a recommendation in his annual message of 1889 for federal legislation to
                    protect Negroes in their voting rights in national elections.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> This legislation
                    as drawn up became known variously as the Federal Elections Bill, the Force Bill, and the Lodge
                    Bill. The proposed election law would have made false registration, interference with registration
                    by violence, intimidation, or bribery <hi rend="i">a crime, and stealing the ballot box or ballots a
                        felony. The major Impetus</hi> for the bill was the feeling on the part of the Republicans that
                    the Democrats were stealing elections—especiaffy in the South. For the first time in
                    sixteen years the Republicans were in control of both houses of Congress as well as the executive
                    branch of the federal government and were in a position to determine legislation. The house passed
                    the elections bill, but it floundered in the Senate where the fight for the legislation was led by
                    Henry Cabot Lodge.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his second annual message Harrison noted that the elections bill was meeting with resistance:
                    "It is said that this legislation will revive race animosities, and some have even
                    suggested that when the peaceful methods of fraud are made positively impossible, they may be
                    supplanted by intimidation and violence." Harrison rejected the logic of such arguments.
                    The only thing that might cause animosity, he thought, was "the fact that some electors
                    have been accustomed to exercise the franchaise for others as well as themselves
                    …." In the face of southern opposition to the proposed law, Harrison made an
                    admirable stand for the free ballot: "No choice is left to me but to enforce with vigor all
                    laws intended to secure to the citizen his constitutional rights."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
                    Three and a half pages of the third annual message to Congress were devoted to the subject of
                    election frauds and the need for legislation. In his fourth and final annual message and in his
                    letter of acceptance for a second party nomination for the election of 1892, Harrison again called
                    for a free ballot, deplored its corruption in the South but despaired of being able <list type="footnotes">

                            paper. Yet it is strange that the very remedy which politicians and the country at large had
                            said was the solution to the race problem could not get through Congress. Even so-called
                            friends of the Negro such as Albion Tourgee and General Samuel C. Armstrong of Hampton
                            Institute were against the bill. Tourgee felt that two thirds of the money would go to the
                            whites if the money was administered by the South. See letter of Tourgee to Harrison,
                            December 7, 1888, Harrison Papers. Armstrong once favored the bill but changed his mind. He
                            thought that the bill gave too much money in too little time. The money might be stolen. It
                            denied the principle of self-help. Armstrong may have been afraid that federal aid would
                            eclipse private institutions such as the one he headed at Hampton. See letter of Armstrong

                    …." On the other hand, the federal nature of the political system made Harrison

                        <salute>Gentlemen:</salute>
                        <p>When you called upon me on the 13th day of May, just prior to my departure with Mrs
                                    Harrison, I expressed myself somewhat fully to you orally upon the subject of the
                                    Memorial which you submitted, and promised to respond in writing at the earliest
                                    practicable moment.</p>
                        <p>Those who have read my public addresses and official papers must be aware of the fact
                                    that I have folt the reproach which lawlessness has brought upon some of our
                                    communities. I have endeavored to hold up the law as the one single admissible rule
                                    of conduct for good citizens. I have appealed against race discriminations and have
                                    asked that law abiding men of all creeds and all colors should unite to discourage
                                    and to suppress lawlessness. Lynchings are a reproach to any community; they impeach
                                    the adequacy of our institutions for the punishment of crime; they brutalize the
                                    participants and shame our Christian civilization. I have not time to explain to you
                                    the limitations of the Federal power further than to say that under the Constitution
                                    and laws I am, in a large measure, without the power to interfere for the prevention
                                    or punishment of these offenses. You will not need to <pb n="211" id="VAA4025-065-3-057"/> be assured that the Department of Justice will let no

                                    to bring the guilty persons to punishment. I will give the matter you have suggested
                                    the most serious consideration and you may be assured that my voice and help will be
                                    given to every effort to arouse the conscience of our people and to stimulate

                        sometimes been urged by mobs for failure to pursue the appointed methods for the punishment of
                        crime, that the accused have an undue influence over courts and juries. Such activities are a

            <p>Racial discontent seems to have been greater during Harrison's administration than those of
                    previous Presidents. As one newspaper stated: "President Harrison is in a peck of trouble
                    about the color question. He pretends to be at ease but he is not."<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
                    While no written testimony from the President was unearthed on the subject, even the White House
                    kitchen and stables were not without racial significance—according to the newspapers.
                    Editors of the day took delight in calling attention to the complexion of the servants. One
                    newspaper said, for example, and with apparent glee: "The servants [in Harrison's
                    employ] are both black and white. The two waiters in the dining room are polite young darkies.
                    Downstairs there is a black cook, but there will probably be a Frenchman when the [social] season
                    begins. Over in the laundry, at the other end of the basement, there are two white women employed,
                    so the service is about equally distributed." The President's carriage was still
                    driven by one Albert Hawkins whose "shinning [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] black face,"
                    however, did not show up quite so brilliantly in Harrison's "dark green livery as

                    servants has not been determined. However, the discussion of the servants in the newspapers, with
                    careful attention to their color and complexion, affords testimony on the racial tenor of the
                        times.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Harrison was, of course, conscious of this racial feeling and race prejudice in American life, North
                    and South. He was rather lenient in his assessment of the status, hopes, and aspirations of the
                    Negro. No evidence has been found that he expressed himself on the subject of race mixing, but his
                    strong recommendation of the unsuccessful Federal Elections and aid to education bills reflected a
                    genuine effort to reopen the attack upon the smoldering race problem, a step unique among Presidents
                    during the last quarter of the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>Harrison spoke vigorously, positively, strongly, and clearly on the race problem in his annual
                    messages to Congress, and he called for a more complete inclusion of the Negro in American life.
                    More unique was the comparative absence of the usual political hedging in his racial dialogue.
                    However, he did not always take full advantage of opportunities outside official channels to
                    influence public opinion. Although he considered himself powerless in the face of violation of Negro
                    rights on the state level, further investigation might well show that in his strong advocacy of the
                    Federal Elections Bill, the Blair Education Bill, and antilynching legislation, Harrison exerted
                    greater leadership, no matter how unsuccessful, in matters of race than any of the
                    post-Reconstruction Presidents prior to the twentieth century.</p>

            <p>Writing in 1936, more than forty years after Benjamin Harrison stepped down as President, Julius W.
                    Pratt said, "Whoever was chiefly responsible, the Harrison administration adopted an
                    expansionist policy which, though barren of results, foreshadowed in its purposes the
                    'large policy' of 1898."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> This may have been the
                    first hint for historians who followed to look beyond Secretary of State James G. Blaine when
                    considering the foreign policy of Harrison's one term in the White House.</p>
            <p>Such has been Harrison's fate, however, that only in the 1960s have historians started to
                    consider seriously his role in foreign policy. Walter LaFeber has said, "Many of the
                    administration's ambitious, expansive policies which have been ascribed to Blaine should in
                    fact be more rightly credited to the President. Harrison has never received proper recognition as a
                    creator of the new empire." John A. S. Grenville and George Berkeley Young have credited
                    Harrison with being "the first President since the Civil War who fully recognized the need
                    to coordinate the strategic, diplomatic, and economic factors of policy."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Yet the only book length treatment of the foreign policy of the Harrison administration was
                    written in 1927 and its title, <hi rend="i">The Foreign Policy of James G. Blaine</hi>, speaks for
                    what it credits to Harrison.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> A complete reevaluation of Harrison's
                    role in foreign policy is long overdue, and the first aspect to consider is why it has taken some
                    seventy-five years to bring Harrison out of the shadow of Blaine.</p>
            <p>Harrison entered the presidency with a severe handicap: his previous career could not begin to
                    compare with Blaine's. The latter had been speaker of the House of Representatives from
                    1869 to 1875, then minority leader, but failed in his first bid for the Republican presidential
                    nomination in 1876. He moved up to the Senate in 1876 and in 1880 engaged in the historic deadlock
                    with Ulysses S. Grant for the party's nomination, then <hi rend="i">switched his support to
                        James A. Garfield. In return, Garfield selected him</hi> for secretary of state. Blaine made a
                    reputation for his bold foreign policy in less than one year, before he had to retire following
                    Garfield's assassination. <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Harrison, in contrast, held no important office until elected to the Senate in 1881, then served only
                    one term, and was defeated for reelection in 1887. He had supported Blaine at both the 1880 and 1884
                        conventions.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> At the 1888 convention, however, Harrison emerged as one of
                    the leading contenders for the presidential nomination. Blaine had meanwhile departed for Europe in
                    June, 1887, and did not return until August, 1888.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> He refused to try for the

            </p>
            <p>Harrison thus found himself already in debt to the influential Blaine. The extremely sarcastic John
                    Hay described how that debt increased during the campaign: "What a magnificent welcome he
                    [Blaine] is to have in <placeName>

                    affection and enthusiasm is to turn the little mill of Brevet Brigadier General Harrison of Indiana.
                    Well, anything to clean out the White House."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Harrison had the courage
                    to honor the debt by naming Blaine his secretary of state. Why did it take courage? According to
                    Reid, Harry S. New of the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>But Harrison had established his relationship with Blaine while still President-elect. Blaine had
                    indicated within weeks of the election that he wanted to be secretary of state. He asked Reid for
                    support: "It has occurred to me that no little mischief was possibly done by [Stephen]
                    Elkins assuming to tell Harrison … after his nomination that in no event would I enter
                    the cabinet …. I have thought therefore that a line from you simply stating that you knew
                    I would accept the appointment if tendered might be wise."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Harrison,
                    however, would not be rushed, and real pressure was brought to bear by Blaine's supporters.
                    Phelps told Blaine in December that the executive committee of the party had unanimously endorsed
                    him for secretary of state and "intimated they would take any practical step to make their
                    opinion operative on Harrison."<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Blaine then attempted to force Harrison's hand when he told Reid: "This article was
                    suggested by me and drafted by Walker [Blaine's son] …. It is, I think, a most
                    excellent way of giving me a 'boost' as the boys say— far better than a
                    direct endorsement for Secretary of State. I should feel much obligated if you would insert it as an
                    editorial in Saturday's <hi rend="i">Tribune."</hi> Yet two months after the
                    election Hay still wrote sarcastically: "He [Blaine] has not yet heard a word from Harrison
                    …. Well we have only two months to wait. He must make up his mind by the 5th of March
                    unless he should conclude to ask [Thomas] Bayard [<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>

            </p>
            <p>Harrison did not notify Blaine of his appointment until mid-January. John W. Foster, who succeeded
                    Blaine as secretary of state in June, 1892, has most perfectly described what Harrison had already
                    accomplished: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>From the day of his election it had been the intention of Harrison to invite Blaine to become

                            friends became restless under the delay…. Mr. Blaine … frequently
                            talked with me about the other Cabinet places, but I could give him no information as to the
                            intention of the President-elect. He was keeping his own counsel, when Mr. Blaine was

                  </p>
                    </quote> It seems clear Blaine would never reconcile himself to being just another member of the
                    President's cabinet. Foster explained his own unusual role in the Harrison administration:
                    "I had a difficult part to act in preserving the confidence and esteem of both President
                    Harrison and himself [Blaine], <list type="footnotes">

                        acute."<hi rend="sup">15</hi> The two men were natural rivals—with the
                    party's nomination in 1892 an important consideration.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Blaine could not really challenge Harrison's leadership of the administration. Again
                    Foster accurately described the major factor in Blaine's tenure as secretary of state:
                    "During the greater part of the time that Mr. Blaine was Secretary of State he was in poor
                    health, and often was confined to his bed or room for weeks with attacks of sickness….
                    When I assumed charge [of the State Department] I found the business very much in arrears and
                    several treaties hung up in the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate for want of proper
                        attention."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Blaine evidently depended heavily on his son Walker, who was solicitor of the State Department, to
                    help carry the work load. In April, 1889, Mrs. Blaine wrote: "I suppose he [Walker] is
                    about as hard working a man as there is in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> but it pays to stand between his Father and the pressure … "<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Then, early in 1890, Walker died—and Blaine had lost his devoted
                    son and most important aide. And his personal tragedy deepened the following month when his daughter
                    Alice also died.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Harrison said of Blaine at that time: "Mr. Blaine
                    … seems to bear up with a fine courage, though at times when he is not engaged, his face
                    is a very sad sight to look upon. Still he has … already taken up his work and I do not
                    much fear that he will break down …."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Blaine's spirit and health had been broken. He did not collapse for another year but was
                    frequently ill in 1890.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> When he did completely fail in 1891, it proved
                    particularly serious because that was the most active year for the administration in foreign policy.
                    In March, 1891, Blaine's secretary told Harrison that Blaine had become
                    "indisposed" and could not leave his bed. He recovered briefly, then collapsed
                    completely. On May 11, Carnegie frankly told Harrison about Blaine's physical condition:
                    "absolute rest and freedom from all work is essential for six weeks … he speaks
                    little and with some difficulty …." That turned out to be an optimistic report.

                            involving the Blaine family which contributed to a steadily declining relationship with the
                            President: Harrison's refusal to appoint Walker Blaine, who had been third
                            assistant secretary of state under his father in 1881, as assistant secretary of state, and
                            Mrs. Blaine's hostility to Harrison. See <hi rend="i">ibid.</hi>, 251.</item>

                    </placeName> until some five months after his letter had been written. In August, Harrison received
                    a report of Blaine's "progress" from Secretary of the Navy Benjamin
                    Tracy. He said Blaine had suffered from a "sudden, well nigh complete" attack of
                    nervous exhaustion, and his closest friends had been unable to see him for weeks. He concluded:
                    "At his age complete recovery must be counted in years … he could finish the
                    term with no strain or excitement …."<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

                    </placeName> in November, but he should have given up his post. The correspondence between Harrison
                    and Blaine in late 1891 and early 1892 vividly depicts the secretary's decline. When he
                    broke an appointment with Harrison in a note of December 29, the President jotted on the note that
                    it happened to be the third such appointment not met; Blaine had forgotten the other two.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> On January 4 Harrison told Blaine he had received no reply to his request for
                    Blaine to call on him at 10 A. M. Blaine replied the same day, explaining he had been suffering from
                    the "grip" for three days, but insisting he had never received the request from
                    Harrison. The next day, however, he told Harrison he had found the note hidden under some papers and
                    felt "mortified."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Then in March, Harrison informed Reid:
                    "Mr. Blaine is sick again and perhaps this may account for some delays at the State
                    Department …,"<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Blaine's condition seems obvious, but he made no move to resign. No evidence has been found
                    to prove Harrison ever considered asking him to do so. Such a move by the President would
                    undoubtedly have split the party for the 1892 campaign. But the secretary's health actually
                    brought on the final break between the two anyway. In May, 1892, Blaine sent the President a
                    clipping from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

                    <hi rend="i">World</hi> which quoted Harrison's son Russell as saying the nomination of
                    Blaine for the presidency had to be "out of the question." According to this
                    clipping, Russell described the secretary of state as "broken down mentally and
                    physically," and "almost as helpless as a child," alleging Harrison had
                    done all his work for two years. Blaine said he never thought such rumors worth noting in the past,
                    but he had not seen a denial or withdrawal of the article. Russell sent such a denial to Blaine the
                    same day.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>The next day Harrison responded angrily. He felt Blaine's experience should have led him to
                    discredit such a statement, taken "second or third hand." He said he had always
                    been available for an "open and frank" talk. Blaine's reply merely
                    insisted Russell publish his denial in the <hi rend="i">World.</hi> The next day the secretary of
                    state made the situation clear when he told Harrison: "permit me to suggest that talk on
                    such an unpleasant subject would be painful if not impossible …." He thought it
                    would be better to handle such matters in writing.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Blaine sent Harrison his
                    brief letter of resignation less than a month later,<hi rend="sup">29</hi> and by June 29 Foster had
                    been appointed his successor.</p>
            <p>Blaine had operated at full capacity for perhaps one year, then declined rapidly. Harrison, with
                    little publicity, carried the bulk of the work load for him the rest of the way, particularly in
                    1891 and 1892. He did, of course, have help. Foster said he was often consulted by Harrison and
                    cited two important assignments he received from the President. In 1891 Foster was chosen to carry
                    on negotiations for the commercial reciprocity treaties authorized by the McKinley Tariff of 1890.
                    The same year, when Blaine fell ill, he took over negotiations with Great Britain to settle the
                    dispute concerning the seals in the Bering Sea.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Secretary of the Navy Tracy
                    seems to have been the President's closest advisor, but he too suffered through great
                    personal tragedy. In February, 1890, his wife and a daughter died in the same fire in which he
                    received serious burns. By the middle of 1890 he required lengthy rest periods at regular intervals.
                    He worked closely with the President but never challenged Harrison's predominant position
                    in foreign policy.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>Harrison worked hardest during 1891. He told his troubles to Reid in July: "The Executive

                    Blaine disabled I had to conduct the Bering Sea negotiations and the reciprocity matter myself
                    …." He wrote again to Reid in October: "The summer has not been restful
                    …. I had the overburden of State Department work including several important
                    matters." He emphasized Blaine had had six months of rest and was expected back in a

            <p>Harrison was not merely aggressive in his foreign policy; he most definitely supported the
                    "large" policy referred to by Pratt. Harrison actively sought naval bases in the
                    Caribbean and Pacific. These bases would not only be the seeds of empire, but would be needed if
                    ever a canal was built across Central America. Harrison made his desire for such bases quite clear
                    to Reid in October, 1891: "I … have regarded it as very important that in the
                    West Indies, in the Pacific Islands, [and in] South America we should have such [coaling] Stations
                    …. Such stations are of little value in time of war unless they are so held and situated
                    that they could be defended from the shore …."<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The primary target for a naval base in the Caribbean was Mole St. Nicholas in <placeName>

                    need to wait there six months or to go home immediately with defeat. Harrison at the last minute
                    made a slight concession—the only one of any kind that he made during the

            <p>Harrison was clearly more active than Blaine in foreign policy throughout his four years as
                    President—Blaine was not even in office when the move to annex <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="hiu">Hawaii</region>
                    </placeName> developed—but this has never been clearly established. Instead,
                    Blaine's reputation survived the administration. There seems to be little doubt that
                    contemporaries of the two men refused to believe Harrison could have been directing foreign policy.
                    Even Ghauncey Depew, while seconding Harrison's renomination at the 1892 Republican
                    convention, was forced to admit that most people credited Blaine with the administration's
                    foreign policy. He first pointed out that <placeName>
                        <country reg="cl">Chile</country>
                    </placeName> had been "taught a lesson"; <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> and Great Britain had learned in Samoa we had become a world power, and the questions
                    in the Bering Sea had been settled. Then he said: "when I am told the credit for the
                    brilliant diplomacy of this Administration belongs exclusively to the Secretary of State
                    … I am tempted to seriously inquire, who, during the last four years, has been President

                    second best in a comparison to Blaine during their own time, but the facts indicate Harrison
                    deserved more.</p>

            <p>This highly creditable contribution has been made by a DePauw University scholar who is at once a
                    deft stylist and a diligent digger in primary and secondary sources. Chronologically, it follows <placeName>

                    </placeName> University Professor Emma Lou Thornbrough's excellent <hi rend="i">Indiana in
                        the Civil War Era, 1850-1880</hi>, which appeared in 1965.</p>
            <p>No strain is placed on the reader's imagination to suggest that the shade of an Edward
                    Eggleston or a Charles A. Beard would thoroughly approve of the author's emphases and space
                    allocations. Only three chapters deal exclusively with politics, and only one chapter is devoted to
                    the First World War. Economic, educational, religious, literary, and related history will be found
                    in nearly four fifths of the book—with agriculture, conservation, and labor among the
                    broad subjects which are assigned a chapter apiece. Thus <hi rend="i">Indiana in Transition</hi> has
                    both the strengths and the limitations often identified with works the arrangement of which is
                    primarily topical. Given the variety and detail of the material necessarily treated, the reviewer is
                    of the opinion that overall no possible alternative would have served Phillips' purposes so
                    well.</p>
            <p>Few gremlins have crept between the boards. <placeName>

                    </placeName> Senator James A. Hemenway of Indiana failed to win reelection in 1909 (p. 93n); he was
                    not under serious consideration in 1911. "The much-criticized secret legislative caucus of
                    1906" (p. 107) and the "secret legislative caucus … in 1906"

                    Meredith Nicholson (p. 518). Other mistakes, whether of commission or omission, are few and
                    comparatively minor. On the other hand, pluses are abundant. This reviewer has rarely read an
                    historical study of any state so full of both accurate information and sensible interpretation. The
                    many maps, illustrations, and bibliographical contributions are first rate. And from the standpoint
                    of an adroit balancing of statistical data and readable narrative, few works on the Hoosierland can
                    be so confidently recommended. In short, Phillips' volume is at once a storehouse of facts
                    to be exploited and admired and an appealing presentation delightful to peruse.</p>
            <p>At times a pathfinder in the field of history and at other times a synthesist of
                    predecessors' discoveries, Professor Phillips deserves the hearty congratulations of
                    Hoosiers near and far—and indeed of all Americans intrigued by the story of
                    Indiana's people, preferences, standards, and growth.</p>

                    century?</p>
            <p>The reader will encounter some familiar names, many of them noted Europeans, that would appear in any
                    such travel anthology—Jacques Marquette, Morris Birkbeck, William Cullen Bryant, Harriet
                    Martineau, Charles Dickens, and Anthony Trollope to mention a few. In addition, there are numerous
                    less known works, such as Aurelia King's personal letter vividly describing the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> fire.</p>
            <p>The almost three hundred year span of history can offer something interesting to any armchair
                    historian. He will visualize the beauty of the virgin countryside as seen through the eyes of the
                    explorers and early travelers, and he will shrink with the timidness of an easterner at the
                    unsanitary conditions of primitive eating and sleeping facilities, as well as resent the close
                    confinement with unwashed mankind in the interior of a crowded stage coach lurching over unimproved
                    roads. He will undoubtedly be repelled by uncouth manners but warmed by friendly frontier
                    hospitality, and he will be far less than human if he does not marvel at the energy and
                    determination of all the people who helped make <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> the state it is today.</p>
            <p>From the neatly boxed exterior of the volume to the concluding essay extolling the virtues of the
                    state, the book is an enjoyable experience. Each account is briefly introduced by the editor. In a
                    few instances he is handicapped by a lack of information about the writer, but even when prefacing
                    the work of a noted essayist, his remarks do not overshadow the source material. <pb n="231" id="VAA4025-065-3-077"/> For the most part the footnotes have the virtue of not intruding upon
                    the reader's attention, but frequently there is the desire to know more about men, events,
                    or places referred to in the text. The footnote format is radically different, and no explanation is
                    given for this departure from tradition. The book is a contribution to the <placeName>

            <p>This attractive anthology gathered from the writings of Professor Thomas D. Clark is organized around
                    three types of pioneering: "The Frontier West and South," "The Frontier
                    of Social Change," and "The Frontier of Historical Research." Forty-six
                    selections, drawn from fourteen of the historian's works, represent most of his varied
                    writings over a period of almost thirty years. The most extensive are those taken first from <hi rend="i">The Emerging South</hi> (1961), then from <hi rend="i">The Southern Country Editor</hi>
                    (1948), <hi rend="i">Pills, Petticoats and Plows</hi> (1944), <hi rend="i">The Rampaging
                    Frontier</hi> (1939), and <hi rend="i">The South Since <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> (1967). The Introduction offers a pleasant biographical sketch and an
                    explanation of the nature and purpose of the volume.</p>
            <p>The arrangement of the book is casual, for notwithstanding the breadth of Clark's interests,
                    his writing is concerned essentially with a single topic, the lives of his countrymen chiefly in the
                    nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. No maps or charts, no masses of statistical data, nothing
                    of computerized quantification, no pseudoscientific jargon mar these delightful essays. Whether the
                    author is recounting one of his colorful anecdotes, describing the landscape, analyzing the myths of
                    southern tradition, or evaluating the changing patterns of race relations, his pages are infused
                    with sympathetic understanding, humane and civilized values, and a genial humor. Readers familiar
                    with Clark's work and those who know the man need not be told of those qualities, but
                    others in search of them will find them in this book in abundance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Three American Frontiers</hi> is a volume that may be opened at random and read with
                    pleasure. Another such collection could be made without duplication, and admirers of
                    Clark's historical writing may miss some of their favorite stories and other passages. But

                    </placeName>, has a great deal of fascination about it and has prompted a growing number of
                    publications. <hi rend="i">Chronicles of the Gringos</hi> is the latest, the bulkiest for a long
                    time, and clearly one of the most enthralling accounts from the standpoint of human interest. It is
                    not, to quote the editors, "a general history, a textbook account, or a tractarian
                    commentary on the immorality" of the conflict. It is, rather, an attempt "to
                    recreate it in several dimensions by assembling the eyewitness accounts of the Gringo soldiers and
                    those close to them …" (p. xviii).</p>
            <p>Smith and Judah have gone far toward achieving their aim, insofar as it may be possible to recreate
                    the experiences of thousands of men in three years of war between the boards of one book. Their
                    industry is impressive, for they publish excerpts from letters, diaries, journals, public documents,
                    reminiscences, books, and articles collected in a very extensive search of repositories, chiefly in
                    the East and Midwest. Five long chapters (271 pages) are devoted to the making up of the wartime
                    army and to following its major campaigns and battles—under Zachary Taylor, Winfield
                    Scott, Stephen W. Kearny, Alexander W. Doniphan, <hi rend="i">et al.</hi> The remaining five
                    chapters deal with subjects of more or less general concern to all "gringo"
                    soldiers in the war: camp life, discipline, problems of transportation, supply, equipment, food,
                    etc. One of the best of these chapters, supported by considerable material previously unknown to
                    this reviewer, is on the health problems of the army. Parallels have been drawn by other historians
                    (not in this volume by Smith and Judah) between the wars in Mexico, 1840s, and in <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">North Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName>, 1960s, but, gratefully for the present generation, the magnificent medical services
                    now available have destroyed the parallel in one regard. They have reversed the ancient rule that
                    more army lives are lost by germ action than by enemy fire. The figures cited in this book, as good
                    as any no doubt, are that 1,192 "gringos" died in action plus 529 of wounds, while
                    11,155 died of disease.</p>
            <p>This reviewer believes that the "average" reader—the layman or college
                    undergraduate—who picks up this book, cannot fail to get a considerable understanding of
                    what life was like in the <placeName>

                    editors' concept of the book, however, it does not offer the benefit of analysis or
                    balanced appraisal for most aspects of the military experience. Such of this as is present may be
                    hard to reach because the index is inadequate and there is no bibliography. There are eighty-six

                    and insufficiently identified, and several of the maps are faulty. The editors' view of the
                    war is completely one sided—the American army from the American side. The few Mexican
                    writings included were taken in translation from American publications. The name Monterrey is
                    misspelled deliberately throughout the book because "gringos" of the 1840s

            <p>For obvious reasons the history of the Democratic party and its leadership in the Civil War period,
                    and just afterward, has attracted nothing like as much attention or interest as has been given to
                    the more lustrous record of the Republican party. Professor Katz does much to close some of the more
                    glaring gaps in this attractively written biography of one of the cleverest and most conspicuous of
                    all the party managers in American history.</p>
            <p>He finds that August Belmont, who for a dozens years was head of the Democratic National Committee,
                    and who then for eighteen years longer (he died in 1890) remained one of the guiding, if aging,
                    leaders of party councils, was a victim of tragic frustrations. He had every qualification of
                    training in the adept and cosmopolitan world of finance—in which the Rothschild family
                    had risen to prominence—to hold a place as one of the eminent financiers of the long
                    period from 1850 to the final rise of the House of Morgan nearly three generations later. He was
                    gifted not only with great natural quickness and astuteness in dealing with intricate business and
                    financial affairs, but with a striking skill in organizing men and corporations to conquer the
                    difficulties of a nation engaged in headlong industrial development. Belmont also possessed marked
                    qualities of geniality and tact which, combined with his social vision and unfailing cordiality,
                    enabled him to overcome the chill suspicions and hostilities that, as a foreign born Jew, he
                    encountered in a period of political and economic turmoil, civil war, and reconstruction.</p>
            <p>He became a social favorite, a Titan of the financial sphere, and one of the few Americans known both
                    for his wide international relations in finance and politics and for his sustained influence in the
                    administration of national affairs. He had ahandsomely impressive stature and dress, with keen
                    snapping eyes above his thick sideburns and firm chin. He had a <pb n="234" id="VAA4025-065-3-080"/>
                    veritable talent for friendship, winning the intimacy of a wide variety of people from the supple,
                    then serving, James Buchanan and the slyly ruthless John Slidell to the rigidly capable Abram S.
                    Hewitt and the monumentally unbending Grover <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>He made many enemies, from the implacable Whitelaw Reid, Republican chieftain, to the enigmatically
                    self-centered George B. McClellan. He had the difficult responsibility of guiding the Democratic
                    party which, after sending to the White House two of the most incompetent men—<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Pierce and Buchanan—who occupied it in the long period from Zachary Taylor
                    to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> G. Harding, had an instinct for secondary chieftains which almost never failed. When it
                    did not nominate one preeminently mediocre figure for high office as it repeatedly did, the
                    Democratic party nominated two at once, as when in 1868 it made the unmatchable choice of Horatio
                    Seymour and Frank P. Blair for President and Vice President. Katz does justice to the repeated
                    blunders of the party and to such sorry episodes as the "most fumbling campaign in our
                    history," which ended in Ulysses S. Grant's monumental victory over Seymour.</p>
            <p>The author does justice also to the modest contributions of Belmont to American social and
                    intellectual life, including his use of great wealth in the purchase of fine furniture, wines, and
                    works of art. He is less happy in dealing with Belmont's diplomatic ventures, but then
                    Belmont failed in his ambition of using the American Embassy in Madrid to bring about the bloodless
                    acquisition of <placeName>
                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Justly appreciative of Belmont's sterling qualities, the author, nevertheless, makes it
                    clear that the financier-politician lacked high principle, never once in antebellum days assailing
                    or criticizing slavery, and that he always managed to keep close to the sources of power in party
                    and government. His great frustration was that he failed of any high distinction or accomplishment
                    in politics, and after quarreling decorously with President Buchanan and failing to help Stephen A.
                    Douglas gain the White House, slowly but steadily lost prestige and power.</p>
            <p>This well composed biography throws much new light on the mechanics of party politics from money
                    raising to platform writing in the middle of the nineteenth century. It presents a favorable picture
                    of Douglas' effort in the 1850s to gain the presidency. He throws due light on the shaky

            <p>Designed to fill the need for a comprehensive study embracing the findings of recent scholarship, <hi rend="i">The Radical Republicans</hi> succeeds admirably within the limits of this objective. It
                    is a widely researched, well organized, and carefully written reappraisal of the role of the rather
                    amorphous group of individuals who functioned, as the subtitle and Trefousse insist, as
                    "Lincoln's vanguard for racial justice."</p>
            <p>Identifying radicalism by a determination of "which leaders constituted its core"
                    (p. 5), Trefousse traces the movement from its beginnings in the antislavery crusade through its
                    great triumphs during Civil War and Reconstruction to its eventual decline in the controversies of
                    the 1870s. Composed of "determined opponents of slavery, who had often held progressive
                    ideas long before the founding of the party" (p. 33), the Radical Republicans emerged in
                    the election of 1856 as "a permanent force in national politics" (p. 102). They
                    struggled to keep the Republican party true to their principles. They were satisfied with
                    Lincoln's election, and Radical "backbone enabled Lincoln to stand firm"
                    (p. 167) in meeting the great menace of disunion. With the outbreak of war the Radicals became
                    "the vanguard of the nation" (p. 168), working with the President in order to
                    advance their common aims. In the Emancipation Proclamation this "interaction between the
                    Radicals and the President—a relationship marked by similar goals but different
                    methods—had proven productive of great good" (p. 230). Despite continuing
                    political differences and the Radical effort to replace him as the party nominee in 1864, Lincoln
                    remained willing to cooperate with this element of the party and by early 1865 was
                    "approaching the radicals' position on reconstruction" (p. 304). Without
                    Lincoln it was to be greatly different. Andrew Johnson spurned the Radical Republicans and failed to
                    "implement successfully a policy of his own" (p. 334). Determined as ever, the
                    Radicals, increasingly divided and frustrated, were "unable to carry their program to its
                    logical conclusion and give land to the Negroes" (p. 370). They blundered seriously in the
                    impeachment of Johnson, although a few last victories were still to be theirs. "If their
                    attempts to enforce racial equality failed at the time, these efforts were nevertheless
                    remarkable" (p. 435) and "laid the foundation for the achievement of their goals
                    in the twentieth [century]" (p. 470).</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Radical Republicans</hi> goes far toward reversing the traditional view of the place
                    of the Radicals. Trefousse makes good use of the important primary sources as well as numerous
                    monographs and biographies that emphasize their contributions. He has produced a sound synthesis but
                    one overly favorable to his subject. In Trefousse's estimate the Radical Republicans were
                    morally right and politically progressive for the noblest reasons. He grants <pb n="236" id="VAA4025-065-3-082"/> them too great credit for triumphs—only partly
                    deserved—and suggests that even failures were actually victories since they made possible
                    the racial advances of a century later. It is as if without the Radicals nothing was possible but
                    with them all things were.</p>
            <p>The book provides a convenient survey of the Radical Republicans, but for full understanding it is
                    still necessary to consult the more exact and exacting sources. The work needs more precise
                    definitions, more critical analysis, more judicious balance. Finally any judgment of this work, as
                    of the Radicals themselves, must applaud the intent but question the execution.</p>

            <p>Eleven essays are gathered in this volume, two dating from the 1940s and the remainder from the
                    1960s. The nine here reproduced in their original form were scattered widely in books and journals.
                    One previously unpublished essay, "John <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Paradox of Leadership Among American Negroes," and one newly revised
                    bibliographical treatment of Civil War background add to the usefulness of the collection. The
                    author has grouped his writings into three categories. Three essays are on the nature of
                    southernism, one of which is the well known analysis of "The Historian's Use of
                    Nationalism and Vice Versa." Three others classified as historiography include the
                    author's 1947 inaugural lecture as Harmsworth Professor at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, "The Lincoln Theme and American National Historiography." Five
                    concern the crisis of the Union: a 1941 article on "Horace Greeley and Peaceable
                    Secession," the new piece on John <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a very recent commentary on "The Civil War in the History of the Modern
                    World: A Comparative View," and two already widely used items, "Jefferson Davis
                    and the Political Factors in Confederate Defeat" and "Why the Republicans Rejected
                    Both Compromise and Secession." Professor Potter's many admirers will rejoice that
                    these eleven are now so conveniently available.</p>
            <p>The title of the volume is probably no worse than any other would be but nevertheless is inadequate
                    to describe the wide ranging of a brilliantly perceptive and doggedly persistent mind. If there is a
                    unifying theme at other than a superficial level, it probably arises less from the fact that
                    southern history provides the bulk of the examples employed than from the identity of the real
                    object of scrutiny, the historian. The author labels as "a reality about history"
                    the proposition that "the determination of truth depends more perhaps upon basic
                    philosophical assumptions which are applied in interpreting the data than upon the data
                    themselves" (pp. 146-47). And he describes the "supreme task of the
                    historian" as seeing the "past through the imperfect eyes of those who lived it
                    and not with his own omniscient twenty-twenty vision" (p. 246). In a sense, throughout
                    these essays he is either patiently <pb n="237" id="VAA4025-065-3-083"/> urging the historian to see
                    himself clearly or actually holding the looking glass before him. Implicit in all is the theme that
                    history incorporates so much of the historian that it behooves both writer and reader to be ever on
                    the alert to separate the two.</p>
            <p>Dean Acheson recently commented that, while he was secretary of state, a memorandum so persuasively
                    written as to defy ready dissection sometimes baffled him until he had it rewritten in jargon, after
                    which he could easily discern the deficiencies in argument. One often has the uneasy feeling while
                    enjoying these polished pieces that someting is amiss that might be recognized if only the style
                    were not so disarmingly lucid. It is hardly necessary, however, to endow their author with
                    superhuman accuracy or judgment to maintain that this volume should be read by anyone who seriously
                    studies history and that it will long continue to stimulate as well as chasten practicing members of
                    the historical guild.</p>

            <p>Within his area of special interest, the interaction of government and the economy, Professor Nash
                    has chosen for his latest book a particularly worthy theme—the formulation of national
                    policy since 1890 with respect to one of the nation's most important industries. In
                    briefest compass, the evolution he perceives is from a negative and limited initial policy of
                    antitrust to the current one of positive and broad scale cooperation. Improved understandings on the
                    part of science of the problems of oil finding and oil production, the industry's
                    self-concerns, and the perceived requirements for national well being with respect to foreign and
                    domestic matters have all contributed to this transition. In arriving at his conclusions, Nash has
                    used intensively and well a wide range of sources.</p>
            <p>The two principle goals of current oil policy, in the author's view, are conservation and
                    economic stabilization. To achieve these goals, government and industry have fashioned a network of
                    interrelations which today include federal assistance to the industry through forecasts of probable
                    market demand, prohibition of interstate shipments of oil produced in excess of quotas prescribed by
                    state regulatory bodies under the Interstate Oil Compact, favorable tax provisions and a tariff on
                    imported oil to stimulate domestic exploration, research on oil finding and oil production by the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Bureau of Mines, and support of American oil companies in exploration and production
                    overseas. The author finds the first powerful push toward industry-government cooperation to have
                        <pb n="238" id="VAA4025-065-3-084"/> occurred during World War I as a result of war needs. This
                    cooperation matured subsequently in response to feared shortages and actual glut during the twenties
                    and the New Deal era. He finds little change since World War II except in the allied field of
                    natural gas, which earlier had been of relatively minor importance and thus had lagged in the
                    formulation of national policy.</p>
            <p>Nash has dealt with a large and, at times, controversial subject in a clear and notably evenhanded
                    way. Where arguments have run hot, he has been careful to present both sides. He has also been
                    willing to generalize and to give firm judgments. His discussion of the evolution of national oil
                    policy does not conform to the view of some recent historians who see business interests working
                    their will on society through the instrumentality of the national government, but he might have
                    dealt with this point more explicitly. And on the matter of the tax depletion allowance there
                    obviously continues to be considerably less than total consensus between industry and government.</p>
            <p>Not the least of the merits of this book is its annotated bibliography. In his survey of the
                    literature, Nash has pointed to opportunities for a number of more specialized studies which would
                    both supplement and act as a check on his own. One helpful bibliographical item which escaped his
                    net (p. 61) is Peter Reed's article on Standard Oil in <placeName>
                        <country reg="io">Indonesia</country>
                    </placeName> in the Autumn, 1958, issue of the <hi rend="i">Business History Review.</hi> And there
                    are a few small errors, like confusing Senator Elbert Thomas with Elmer Thomas (pp. 221, 268) or
                    reading Appalachian production in 1899 as 93 per cent of the national total instead of about 50 per
                    cent (p. 3). But these are minor matters in a generally very useful and informative book.</p>

                    science. During his college career he "dropped out" to run one of his
                    father's farms. He later returned to Ames to complete his degree and become a member of the
                    faculty. During his teaching career he became part owner of <hi rend="i">Farm and Dairy</hi> and his
                    father, known as the editor "Uncle Henry," edited this farm journal. <hi rend="i">Farm and Dairy</hi> eventually became <hi rend="i">Wallaces' Farmer</hi>, a family
                    owned paper which became a powerful voice for rural America. Henry G. Wallace left his academic post
                    at <placeName>

                    outspoken farm leader during the Populist and Progressive eras.</p>
            <p>Henry A., born in 1888, was, in fact, the son of a farmer, and he grew up in the atmosphere of an
                    effective publishing family. From his grandfather he received a deep religious spirit and an
                    awareness of the need for active social service. From his mother he learned to love flowers and
                    plant life. As a youngster he tagged along with George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Carver while Carver conducted his agricultural experiments at <placeName>

                    </placeName> State College. This contact intensified Wallace's interest in the application
                    of science to agricultural problems. During his college career he experimented with hybrid corn and
                    in later years helped to develop a profitable hybrid corn company. Following college he trained
                    himself in higher mathematics and statistics and deepened his economic theories by studying the
                    writings of Hibbard and Veblen. His attitude toward business abuses is reflected in the fact that
                    all three of the Henrys supported Theodore Roosevelt in his bid for the presidency in 1912.</p>
            <p>Henry A. came closer to farm problems while his father worked for increased food production during
                    World War I and later became secretary of agriculture under President <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> G. Harding. The farmer had not recovered from the postwar depression and the work of
                    President Harding and Henry C. Wallace for the relief of the farmer was far from negative according
                    to the authors. Henry C. died in 1924, and at the age of thirty-six, Henry A. became Henry Wallace,
                    the editor of <hi rend="i">Wallaces' Farmer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Henry Wallace had written his first book in 1920 urging farmers to emulate big business by curtailing
                    production. He soon saw the need for more vigorous support at state and national levels for the
                    remedy of farm problems. He believed in the superiority of rural life over urban life. As an editor
                    he became one of the foremost agricultural thinkers in America and occupied a place among the
                    eminent spokesmen on farm problems. He fought hard for the principles of the McNary-Haugen bill and
                    was so disappointed over President Calvin Coolidge's veto of the bill that he campaigned
                    for Al Smith in 1928, even though Herbert Hoover was a native son of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>. By 1930 Wallace was an ardent champion of the domestic allotment plan supported by a
                    process tax to aid the farmer. He tried, with no success, to direct the rebellious spirit of John
                    Simpson and Milo Reno into more positive channels.</p>
            <p>It was this leadership that led to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> D. Roosevelt's selection of Henry Wallace as secretary of agriculture. The
                    authors present Wallace's <pb n="240" id="VAA4025-065-3-086"/> secretarial career in detail
                    and picture him as a most successful administrator. Wallace's role in the Agricultural
                    Adjustment Association, the retirement of marginal lands, the ever normal granary, his
                    administrative problems, and his ability to blend New Deal ideas into a new philosophy made him an
                    effective and also a marked man in FDR's cabinet. It was Wallace's ability to
                    spell out the philosophy of the New Deal that encouraged Roosevelt to name him as a running mate in
                    1940.</p>
            <p>This is a well researched and scholarly book. It is a genuine contribution to an era of our history.
                    Some historians may not agree that Wallace was the nation's greatest secretary of
                    agriculture, especially since no secretary of agriculture has been loved by the farmer since the
                    early 1920s. The editing of the book is a bit disconcerting, especially if one wishes to check the
                    source for a quotation. On page 23 a long quotation is given, but the number for the footnote
                    follows at the end of an unrelated paragraph. Citations are pushed together. Chapter eleven has
                    nearly fifty citations listed under note number 4. There is an incomplete sentence on page 136.</p>

                    </placeName> Democracy, a once dominant coalition of rural, old stock citizens and urban Irish, was
                    first rent asunder by the fierce, intraparty battle over the League of Nations. A key element in
                    this conflict was the bitter, personal feud between President Woodrow Wilson and the irascible,
                    irreconcilable senator from <placeName>

                    </placeName> James A. Reed. During the twenties certain divisive domestic issues such as farm relief
                    legislation, the Ku Klux Klan, and, most important, prohibition continued to plague the party and
                    assure its minority status.</p>

                    shift, he insists, began because of Republican indifference and a calculated Democratic campaign to
                    woo black voters long before the Depression shattered the national economy. Since that time the
                    Negro voter has been the most faithful member of the dominant Democratic organization.</p>

                    southeast shared the economic and social outlook of the Deep South; the grain and livestock farmers
                    of the north possessed the attitudes of the Midwest's corn-hog farm belt; the urban areas

                    </placeName> were similar to the nation's eastern industrial complexes. The author attempts
                    to show how various factors—sectionalism, rural-urban antagonisms, ethnic differences,

                    historian, unwilling to pervert his discipline to prove a thesis, points up once again the
                    complexity of political analysis when dealing with a multitude of possible causal factors.</p>

                    during the years of World War I, 1914-1918. Sprinkled with wit and rich in understanding concerning
                    human foibles, he preserves a slice of Hoosier life in a small town in which agricultural and rural
                    influences still held full sway. His comments about Hoosier politics and politicians are revealing
                    and extremely interesting but not always entirely advantageous to the reputation of persons
                    discussed. This volume is also quite instructive in indicating how a small town newspaper was run
                    somewhat over a half century ago. Readable and informative as the book is, the author must be placed
                    on academic probation as regards his general knowledge of Indiana's history. For instance,
                    he incorrectly runs the <placeName>

                    had a "proviso that it might be amended or changed by a majority of all votes cast at any
                    general election" (p. 169).</p>

                    O'Donnell has based this volume on substantial research in records of county commissioners,
                    newspapers, and various other sources. He exhibits much understanding of the highlights of the
                    principal topics discussed, and he is aware of how general developments at the state and national

                    related selections introduced by brief commentary. The individual selections are also preceded by
                    short comments. The nature of the material enables Stibitz to include both more poets and more works
                    in his volume; introductory information is consequently quite brief. Stibitz has rather thoroughly
                    discussed his selective process which provides "not just poetry by <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> poets but poetry that also is in some way Illinoisan or midwestern in subject matter
                    and spirit" (p. xiv), poetry which also represents national trends, and a
                    "selection representative of successive periods in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> history" (p. xiv). From 1818 to 1968, from William Leggett to William Vaughn
                    Moody to Vachel Lindsay to Gwendolyn Brooks and many others, Stibitz has done much to achieve his
                    goal. There is good poetry and mediocre poetry here, but it is almost always interesting poetry.
                    Webb's volume is shorter and in some ways much less comprehensive than the former volume.
                    Recognizing the hazards of short excerpts of prose, Webb has presented substantial selections from
                    fifteen authors which represent to him "the best and most interesting prose about <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> by residents of that land" (p. vii). Beginning with a letter from Father
                    Gabriel Marest in the early eighteenth century and other "Early Settlers" through
                    "Abraham Lincoln," a section on "<placeName>

                    corrections—of his Miami University sesquicentennial publication of 1958. Four chapters
                    have been added "sketching the University in these years [1959-1969] of strenuous
                    development" (p. 318). The updating begins with a chronicle of "The
                    Sesquicentennial Year" and moves then into the real developments of the years: growth of
                    physical facilities, student body, and national recognition (the latter primarily because of alumni
                    sports personalities); changes in calendar and graduate curriculum; a new president; student
                    protest; and future planning. It is a pleasant book which includes many facts about the university
                    handled in an imaginative fashion. It is interesting to the public because of historical settings
                    and the example of growth and progress in education; for Miami graduates and others who have real
                    ties with the university, it will also no doubt serve as a framework by which to remember their own
                    Miami years. <hi rend="i">Pamela J. Bennett, Indiana University, <placeName>

                    </placeName> born brothers. General William Tecumseh Sherman and Senator John Sherman, reared
                    separately and vastly different in character and outlook, were instrumental in many of the important
                    political and military events of the 1800s. This work, edited by General Sherman's
                    daughter, describes much of the drama of the nineteenth century and "offers something more
                    as well, providing insight into the dynamics of leadership, illustrating how those who appear to
                    control events are controlled by them in turn" (p. XI). The editor has concentrated on
                    letters written between 1861 and 1877 and has deleted portions of many letters. The correspondence
                    here published, however, contains a running commentary on more than fifty years of American history
                    and reveals two powerful, articulate, exciting participants in that history. <hi rend="i">Lorna
