                <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> study of political theories seems to be attracting
                    considerable attention at present, a number of able writers, such as Dunning,
                    Willoughby, Merriam, Osgood, and others having recently made contributions to
                    this branch of research. Political theories are not only of theoretical
                    interest, but have at times greatly influenced historical development. This is
                    true in marked degree of those ideas whose genesis is traced in the following
                    pages. They have been put forward repeatedly as a protest against oppression and
                    arbitrary power. Their greatest influence, however, has made itself felt since
                    the American Revolution. They have in large measure contributed to make our
                    American political institutions what they are to-day. They are often spoken of
                    as American principles. Though they did not originate inr this country, they
                    were here for the first time incorporated in the political programme of a great
                    nation, and have been more completely realized here than in any other
                    country.</p>

                <p>The following dissertation was begun at the suggestion of Professor Max Lenz of
                    the University of Berlin. It was originally my intention to limit my study to a
                    consideration of the relation between the principles of the French Revolution as
                    expressed in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and the
                    principles of the American Revolution, as expressed in the</p>

                <pb id="VAB1855-008" n="viii"/>
                <p> State papers of that time, especially in the Bills of Rights of the individual
                    States. The recent monograph of Professor Jellinek of Heidelberg, entitled <hi
                        rend="i">Die Erklärung der Menschen- und Bürgerrechte,</hi> translated into
                    English by Professor Farrand, does not seem to me to be entirely satisfactory.
                    Jellinek conveys the impression that the French Declaration of the Rights of Man
                    is a literal transcription of clauses contained in the Bills of Rights of the
                    American States. He fails to show how the French people became acquainted with
                    the principles contained in the American Bills of Rights. He does not consider
                    the discussions that took place in the Constituent Assembly on the Declaration
                    of the Rights of Man. The very fact that these discussions lasted longer than a
                    month and that more than a score of drafts were considered, proves, it seems to
                    me, that a literal transcription of the Bills of Rights is out of the question.
                    In tracing the genesis of the American Bills of Rights, Jellinek overrates the
                    influence of the struggle for religious toleration and undervalues the influence
                    of the theory of Natural Law.</p>

                <p>Though differing from Professor Jellinek on many points, I do not agree with the
                    view taken by E. Boutmy of the French Institute, who fiercely attacks Jellinek
                    in an article to be found in the <hi rend="i">Annales des Sciences
                        Politiques</hi> of the 15th of July, 1902, in which he argues against any
                    American influence whatever, attributing the origin of the Declaration to
                    Rousseau's influence, and considering that document to be an exclusively French
                    production. Though acknowledging the fact that the people of France, yes, of all
                    the civilized countries of Europe, were well acquainted with the political
                    principles in question before the American Revolution occurred, it seems to me
                    that the American people first</p>

                <pb id="VAB1855-009" n="ix"/>

                <p>proclaimed them in the form of a Declaration of Rights. The idea of a Declaration
                    of the Rights of Man is specifically American. There is no trace of such an idea
                    in Rousseau or any other French writer. Indeed, though the political theories
                    the Declaration of the Rights of Man announces are to be found in Rousseau's
                    writings, the idea of drawing up a declaration of individual rights with which
                    the State shall not interfere, is hostile to the entire course of Rousseau's
                    reasoning. The members of the Constituent Assembly in discussing the principles
                    of the Declaration constantly speak of American precedent and refer to the idea
                    of such a declaration as coming from the New World. It was because the
                    well-known theories of the liberal writers seemed to have been triumphantly
                    carried out in America, that the influence of the American Revolution upon
                    Europe was so great. The identical principles embodied in a political programme
                    or declaration according to the manner of the Americans are prefixed to the
                    first French constitution. They were now scattered broadcast throughout Europe,
                    and have contributed more than anything else to the transformation of society
                    and of government along the lines of democracy and individual liberty.</p>

                <p>It has been my purpose to trace the genesis and development of the political
                    theories embodied in the Bills of Rights and in the French Declaration of the
                    Rights of Man, and to show that these documents are the results of a long
                    development. I have confined myself to an historical treatment of the subject.

                <head rend="center b">INTRODUCTION</head>
                <p/>

                <p><hi rend="b">O</hi><hi rend="sc">NE</hi> of the most characteristic features of
                    modern systems of government is the importance attached to individual
                    liberty.</p>

                <p>It is a fascinating as well as an important undertaking to trace the gradual
                    evolution of modern liberty.</p>

                <p>In the despotisms of the Orient personal liberty was entirely unknown, the life,
                    actions, and property of the individual being completely at the mercy of the
                    ruler.</p>

                <p>The Greeks were familiar with the idea of liberty, they confounded liberty with
                    popular sovereignty. They possessed political liberty, but lacked personal
                    freeom in the modern sense. In the Greek city-republics the citizens (excluding
                    of course the slaves, who had no legal rights of any sort) made the laws,
                    decided upon peace or war, elected magistrates, served as judges, and performed
                    the duties resting upon them as partakers of the sovereignty of the State. But
                    there was no sphere of life to which the interference of the government might
                    not be extended. The despotism of the State prevented the growth of private
                    rights. The Greek was primarily a citizen. He existed for the</p>

                <pb id="VAB1855-016" n="2"/>

                <p>State, not the State for him. The family life, the religion, the property, the
                    time, yes, all actions of the individual, were under the control of the State.
                    The Greek State ostracized Aristides and put Socrates to death.</p>

                <p>To the Roman jurists we owe the distinction between public and private rights. "
                    Public Right," they said, " serves the Roman State, Private Right, the interests
                    of individuals."<ref id="ref_001" rend="super" target="note_001">1</ref></p>

                <p> But among the Romans as among the Greeks we notice the same despotism of the
                    State, the same confusion of sovereignty with liberty, which left the individual
                    at the mercy of the State. The Roman citizen could not choose his own religion,
                    as the persecution of the Christians shows. His speech, dress, manners, and
                    actions were regulated by the censors.<ref id="ref_002" rend="super"
                        target="note_002">2</ref></p>

                <p>The feudal system of the Middle Ages obliterated the distinction between public
                    and private rights by associating the possession of property with the exercise
                    of sovereignty. Government was regarded, not as a public trust, but as private
                    property. The possession of land carried with it jurisdiction over those
                    dwelling upon the land. Each baron was lord over his domain. The State no longer
                    existed. There were now only rights and duties between lord and vassal, which
                    were based upon contract and were founded upon personal, not political,
                    relations.</p>
                <p> In modern times the distinction between private and public rights has again been
                    emphasized. The results</p>

                <p>of this separation have been beneficial to both. While public rights and duties
                    have become more majestic and authoritative on the one hand, private rights and
                    duties on the other have become more sharply defined, and have been more widely
                    extended and more effectively secured.</p>
                <p> It is of great importance that the citizens of any State have a wide degree of
                    individual liberty and that they be secure against an infringement of their
                    liberties, not only on the part of other individuals, but also of the
                    government. The degree of liberty and security a people enjoy will profoundly
                    influence their progress. While degradation has been the rule in despotisms, the
                    strongest and most progressive States have been those in which the sphere of
                    individual liberty was large. The progress of the State is the progress of the
                    individuals who are its members. The State lives in its citizens. Paternalism
                    and arbitrary infringement of private rights weaken the State, because they
                    paralyze the initiative and self-reliance of the individual. There is no more
                    instructive example of this truth than the collapse of the Prussian State in
                    1806-1807.</p>

                <p>The desire of personal freedom which is so characteristic of modern times is the
                    product of two factors mainly; namely, of Christianity and of the nature of the
                    modern, as distinguished from the ancient, State. While the religions of the
                    ancient world were State religions, Christianity is the world religion. It
                    appeals to the individual as a man, not as the member of a particular State or
                    people. The Christian religion has no necessary relation to the State. The God
                    of the Christian is no national deity. From the beginning the Christian religion
                    spread to all parts of the world and found adherents among all peoples.
                    Furthermore, Christianity</p>

                <pb id="VAB1855-018" n="4"/>

                <p>enjoins that God must be obeyed rather than man. This implies that in case the
                    State should command what is contrary to the law of God, the individual must
                    resist. We thus have the individual rising up against the State; in exercising
                    his religion he feels himself primarily a man, not a citizen. Here a sphere
                    exists within which interference from any external source whatever is not
                    tolerated. History shows in many examples how the attempt to control the
                    consciences of men brought them into conflict with governments and made them
                    conscious of the fact that they were, first of all, men, not citizens.</p>

                <p>Then, also, the relation of the individual to the government is necessarily
                    entirely different in the modern State--which comprises a large territory, often
                    with many millions of inhabitants--from what it was in the ancient city-state.
                    In the latter a greater unity was possible and consequently the control of the
                    community over the individual was greater. The immediate control of the State
                    over its citizens is likely to diminish as the extent of territory increases.
                    Since it is impossible in a large State that the people exercise their sovereign
                    power directly in a popular assembly, as they did in the city-state of
                    antiquity, the powers of government must be delegated to one or a few persons
                    who represent the State. This makes the distinction between the government and
                    the people more evident. It is easier for the citizen of a very large State,
                    especially of a monarchy, to become aware of his individuality and set himself
                    over against the State, than was the case in the ancient city-state where each
                    citizen had a share in the government, and where the distinction between
                    individual and State was less manifest. England led the way for all other
                    countries of modern</p>

                <pb id="VAB1855-019" n="5"/>
                <p> times in establishing and protecting the liberty of the individual. Magna
                    Charta, the Habeas Corpus Act, and the Bill of Rights are classic examples of
                    declarations of popular rights.</p>

                <p>The rights enumerated in these documents are the rights to which Englishmen are
                    entitled as English subjects. The people of the American colonies, Massachusetts
                    and Virginia taking the lead, drew up declarations of certain rights to which
                    they claimed to be entitled as men. These declarations were prefixed to the
                    state constitutions under the name of Bills of Rights. While the political
                    principles these bills contain 'were not entirely new and did not even originate
                    on American soil, the idea of embodying them in a political programme (an idea
                    of incalculable consequences, since it was in this form those principles exerted
                    their greatest influence) was a distinctively American notion.</p>

                <p>This idea was adopted by the French people during their great Revolution. The
                    famous Declaration of the Rights of Man, drawn up by the Constituent Assembly in
                    1789 and prefixed to the Constitution of 1791, was in its consequences one of
                    the most important instruments ever written. But it was written in conscious
                    imitation of the Bills of Rights of the American States. The so-called
                    principles of 1789 were, as it is one of the aims of this treatise to show,
                    identical with the principles of the American Revolution.</p>

                <p>In Germany the Parliament of Frankfort which met bin 1849 and attempted
                    prematurely to form a united empire drew up a similar declaration of fundamental
                    rights. The constitutions of many civilized nations how contain similar
                    declarations.</p>

                <p>These declarations of the Rights of Man mark a new</p>

                <pb id="VAB1855-020" n="6"/>

                <p>era in the history of mankind. The humanitarian spirit underlies them--the
                    conception that each individual citizen is entitled to the concern of the State;
                    that his personality is of infinite worth and is a purpose of creation; that he
                    should be recognized as an individual, as a man. The principles they contain
                    became the creed of Liberalism. The nineteenth century was preeminently the
                    century of Liberalism. Perhaps no other century witnessed greater and more
                    numerous reforms and a greater extension of individual liberty. This century is
                    marked by the abolition of slavery in all civilized countries, by the extension
                    of the elective franchise, by the emancipation of woman, by the popularization
                    of governments, and by countless other reforms.</p>

                <p>Great as has been the influence of the declaration of the Rights of Man, this
                    declaration must be regarded only as a factor of historical significance. The
                    permanent value of such a declaration may be questioned. The rights known as
                    Rights of Man are everywhere limited in actual practice and could not be carried
                    out to their full extent without causing the subversion of the State. Thus many
                    of the excesses of the French Revolution arose from attempts to realize an
                    equality that will forever remain a dream. Men are not free and equal. Absolute
                    freedom implies the absence of any restraint whatsoever and would destroy the
                    foundation of the State and of Law. Law in its very nature implies compulsion.
                    Equality pushed to its logical conclusion along economic lines would lead to
                    communism. In every State there must be the distinction between the governing
                    and the governed. The only equality among men is, that before God, which is a
                    religious principle; an equality of the formal outlines</p>

                <pb id="VAB1855-021" n="7"/>

                <p>of human nature, these possessing in each individual different content, which is
                    a psycho-physiological rinciple; and equality before the law, which alone is
                    political principle. The right to life may be forfeited by criminal action, or
                    the State may at need demand the sacrifice of life, as in time of war. The right
                    of property may be abridged by the State. Freedom of speech, as the Duke of
                    Wellington said, is a good thing except on board a man-of-war. None of the
                    so-called Rights of Man are absolute rights. Public expediency may and does
                    demand their restriction. The good of the State must ever go before that of the
                    individual. The State alone can determine what rights its members shall enjoy.
                    It knows them not as men, but as citizens. It cannot allow its citizens to
                    appeal to inalienable natural rights, for in that case the individual, not the
                    State, would be recognized as sovereign.</p>

                <p>The Declaration of the Rights of Man was generated by the theories of Natural Law
                    and of the sovereignty of the people. In order to understand its genesis the
                    development of each of these theories must be traced.</p>
                <p> The theory of Natural Law is one of the oldest conceptions in the history of
                    human thought. For many centuries it held almost undisputed sway over the minds
                    of men. It has been one of the most important conceptions ever entertained. In
                    our own time Natural Law has fallen into disregard, partly because of the
                    predominence of the historical method of scientific research and the distrust of
                    philosophic speculation, partly because of the exaggeration of its own claims.
                    It was Grotius, the founder of Natural Law in its modern sense, who first
                    committed the mistake of regarding its principles as equally binding with, if
                    not superior</p>

                <pb id="VAB1855-022" n="8"/>

                <p>to, the positive laws of the State.<ref id="ref_003" rend="super"
                        target="note_003">1</ref> Positive law it is not and cannot be. The State
                    cannot permit its subjects to appeal to laws which it has not itself issued.</p>

                <p> The writers on Natural Law overlooked the fact that ideal laws are very
                    different from laws which are actually enforced by the government. There is a
                    great difference between rights which individuals should, in their own judgment,
                    possess, and those which they actually do possess. It was an error, also, to
                    believe that an ideal code of laws could be framed applicable to all peoples at
                    all times--laws founded in reason alone. To have pointed out the fallacy of this
                    conception so predominent during the eighteenth century; is the merit of the
                    German Historical School of Jurisprudence.</p>

                <p> In 1814 Thibaut, a Heidelberg professor, wrote a pamphlet addressed to the
                    governments and people of Germany, in which he urged that a general civil code
                    be drawn up for all Germany, thereby delivering the people from a multitude of
                    foreign, mostly Roman, laws. He thought that civil laws were, as a whole,
                    founded in the human heart and in reason and would seldom vary with
                        circumstances.<ref id="ref_004" rend="super" target="note_004">2</ref></p>

                <p>The famous Karl Fried. v. Savigny, professor at Berlin and head of the German
                    Historical School, replied to Thibaut's pamphlet by his essay On the Vocation of
                    Our Age for Legislation, in which he maintained that the age was not prepared
                    for the codification of existing laws, inasmuch as jurists lacked the literary
                    ability and the historical and systematic understanding necessary for such work.
                    He thought</p>

                <p>there was progress in the improvement of laws observable, and that it would
                    therefore be possible to deprive future generations of great benefits by fixing
                    present evils. Though not pronouncing absolutely against codification, Savigny's
                    arguments were not favorable to an undertaking of the kind. The great merit of
                    his essay is to have shown that laws are not evolved from reason, but are a part
                    of, and an outgrowth from, the entire life of a people and the development of
                    its character. As the language of a people, especially in early times, is the
                    necessary product of the spirit of that people, so the laws are evolved from the
                    character of the people according to the daily necessities of life and the
                    popular convictions of right. In more advanced times jurists and law-givers may
                    develop laws, but only in accordance with the national and historical
                    development. They may cause germs already present to grow, but they cannot
                    arbitrarily supply new content. The present is indissolubly linked with the
                    past, from which it develops organically.<ref id="ref_005" rend="super"
                        target="note_005">1</ref></p>

                <p> Savigny established the predominence of the Historical School, which holds that
                    there is no separate or isolated existence, but that every particular
                    individuality is a member of a higher entity from which it develops. Though
                    Montesquieu in many respects had anticipated Savigny, the latter took a much
                    deeper view of the subject and secured almost general acceptance of his views.
                    Montesquieu's influence was overshadowed by that of Rousseau. Savigny, however,
                    put forth his views at a very favorable moment; namely, at a time when the
                    magnificent work of Niebuhr had given new dignity to the study of history,
                    when</p>

                <p>Wolf applied historical criticism to the study of philology, at a time also when
                    the stirring uprising against Napoleon and French domination had reawakened the
                    self-consciousness of the European nations and had given them a new interest in
                    the traditions of their past.</p>

                <p> What Savigny and others accomplished in Germany was done for the
                    English-speaking world by the Analytic School of Jurisprudence, whose chief
                    representatives are Bentham and Austin. These jurists returned to the system of
                    Hobbes, maintaining that sovereignty is unlimited, and bringing the theory of
                    natural rights into discredit. Until quite recently Austin's views were scarcely
                    questioned and his influence in England and America has been hardly short of the
                    marvellous.</p>

                <p>The theory of Natural Rights, which was such a potent factor in bringing about
                    modern liberty, lost its hold upon the minds of men just at the time it had won
                    its greatest triumphs. We are living in an age of democracy, but we are
                    experiencing that democracy and liberty are not synonymous terms and that Demos
                    may become a greater despot than any individual ruler. Demos seems to be rapidly
                    becoming the Leviathan which is swallowing up all power. The liberty of the
                    individual is being more and more restrained. Governmental interference is on
                    the increase. The frequency with which injunctions are issued is becoming a most
                    dangerous menace to individual liberty. The great aggregation of wealth in the
                    hands of a few individuals has made these great capitalists masters over the
                    destinies of millions, who are dependent upon them to a larger degree than the
                    subjects of any despot are upon their ruler. We have discarded many of the
                    principles which were once supposed to form the</p>

                <pb id="VAB1855-025" n="11"/>

                <p>very corner-stone of our republic. We have violated the principle that government
                    is based upon the consent of the governed by subjugating the Philippines. We
                    have inflicted greater sufferings upon the Filipinos than England was inflicting
                    upon the colonists when they threw off the hated yoke. Again, the heroic
                    struggle of the Boers for liberty awakened far less interest among the nations
                    than did the revolt of the American colonists or the partitions of Poland over a
                    century ago. Power and wealth, rather than liberty, has become the ideal of the
                    nations, the United States among the rest.</p>

                <p>The theory of Natural Rights is an exploded theory, no longer believed in by any
                    scholar of note. There can, however, be no doubt concerning the fact that this
                    conception, considering the consequences it has had upon historical development,
                    has been one of the most important notions in the history of human thought. The
                    world would have been very different but for the influence of this idea. The
                    following are some of the most important of its consequences:</p>

                <p>1. Its influence upon Roman Law was very marked. The Roman jurists regarded
                    Natural Law as a model system of perfect laws founded in Reason, to which
                    positive laws should as far as possible be made to conform. Natural Law was thus
                    conducive in rendering Roman Law more just, simple, and universal than it would
                    otherwise have been, and was one of the chief reasons for the excellence of
                    Roman Law.<ref id="ref_006" rend="super" target="note_006">1</ref> "The
                    historical significance of Roman Law consists above all in the fact that it
                    developed the abstract conception of subjective law, that is, of the general and
                    equal right of the individual in private law. Therein lies what is</p>

                    the eternal and absolute law for all peoples and ages, or even that a single one
                    of the modern nations can rest satisfied with it, but that an essential and
                    general element of law, which must exist in every system and must in a sense
                    form its foundation, is therein developed in a manner and perfection that it
                    contains the theoretical and practically applicable model for all times and
                        nations."<ref id="ref_007" rend="super" target="note_007">1</ref></p>

                <p>The French lawyers, too, were ardent students of Natural Law. They regarded it as
                    the panacea for the multitudinous and conflicting laws of their own country,
                    varying as they did with each province and municipality.<ref id="ref_008"
                        rend="super" target="note_008">2</ref></p>

                <p>The doctrine of Natural Law also influenced the legislation of Frederick the
                    Great and the formation of the Prussian Landrecht,<ref id="ref_009" rend="super"
                        target="note_009">3</ref> as well as that of the Austrian Civil Code. The
                    latter authorizes judges in cases where positive laws are inapplicable, to
                    decide according to the "natural principles of law." Likewise, the commissioners
                    who prepared a code for India, recommend that in cases not foreseen by law the
                    judges decide "in the manner they deem most consistent with the principles of
                    justice, equity, and good conscience."<ref id="ref_010" rend="super"

                <p>2. Natural law more than any other factor was operative in destroying the
                    exclusive spirit which the Romans possessed and in generating the conception of

                <p>Rome, and the Romans adopted the Stoic conceptions of Natural Law and the
                    equality of men, that the i change from exclusiveness to cosmopolitanism took
                    place--change which was of immense influence on subsequent history. This helped
                    to enable the Romans to form that wonderful system of world-empire which was
                    never paralleled except by the English system of our own time. Greeks and
                    Persians regarded conquered peoples as inferior barbarians. " The importance and
                    mission of Rome," says Jhering, "from the standpoint of universal history,
                    expressed in a word, is the victory of the idea of universality over the
                    principle of nationality."<ref id="ref_012" rend="super" target="note_012"
                        >1</ref> The Roman idea of universal empire dominated the entire history of

                <p> 3. Modern international law was by its founder, Grotius, built upon the
                    principles of Natural Law, which are founded in reason and conscience.<ref
                        id="ref_013" rend="super" target="note_013">2</ref></p>

                <p> 4. Natural Law has exerted great influence on private law, not only in
                    systematizing it, but also in developing its content, because it concerned
                    itself with the individual and the necessities of his nature. In opposition to
                    the force of custom it ever emphasized the truths of justice, equity, and
                        morals.<ref id="ref_014" rend="super" target="note_014">3</ref></p>

                <p>5. The principles of Natural Law have exerted their greatest and crowning effect
                    since the last quarter of the eighteenth century. They have transformed the
                    structure of society and of the State by emphasizing the importance of
                    individual liberty. The democratic spirit, which distinguishes the present era,
                    is in no small</p>

                        <p><hi rend="b">B</hi><hi rend="sc">EFORE</hi> taking up the history of
                            Natural Law it may well to show how Natural Law differs from Positive
                            Law on the one hand and from Moral Law on the other.</p>

                        <p>The Moral Law deals with such actions as tend to promote the interests of
                            society or else to become detrimental to its welfare. Actions are
                            morally right or wrong with reference to the individuals composing
                            society, according as they are good or bad for society as a whole.</p>

                        <p>Positive Law includes the enactments of a particular government,
                            enjoining certain actions upon the citizens and prohibiting others.</p>

                        <p>Laws of Nature follow from the nature of things and not dependent upon
                            any particular form of society government. They are universal rules of
                            action, discovered by natural reason. They form the ideal ording to
                            which men should fashion their actions.</p>

                        <p>Of these three classes of laws one is set down by society and forms the
                            Right; the second is prescribed the government and forms the Law; the
                            third is discovered by reason as Good. While in any particular</p>

                        <p>instance all three may coincide, there is the possibility of a
                                conflict.<ref id="ref_015" rend="super" target="note_015"

                        <p> The ancient Greeks were fond of speculating about the origin and meaning
                            of Law. They first of all peoples developed the conception of Natural
                            Law.</p>

                        <p>The germs of the conception of Natural Law are contained in the teaching
                            of Heraclitus, whose influence. reached its height about 460 B.c. The
                            central thought of his system is the view that all things are in a state
                            of incessant flow. Yet in this world of constant change there prevails
                            an immutable and reasonable law to which all things are subject. This
                            divine law or common reason illumines also the mind of man. All human
                            wisdom is but an imitation of Nature and the Divinity.<ref id="ref_016"
                                rend="super" target="note_016">2</ref> This divine law should guide
                            not only the individual, but also the State. Human laws are but the
                            efflux,of the divine laws.<ref id="ref_017" rend="super"
                                target="note_017">3</ref> Heraclitus is the first philosopher who
                            believes in the Logos or rational world-soul -the eternal,
                            all-comprehensive order of things. This conception of the Logos has
                            dominated all subsequent philosophy down to the present.<ref
                                id="ref_018" rend="super" target="note_018">4</ref> Its bearing upon
                            the theory of Natural Law is evident. Higher and more authoritative than

                            laws which are right, not because they are commanded, but because they
                            are founded in the nature of things.</p>

                        <p>The views of Heraclitus were attacked by Archelaus and by the Cyrenaican

                        <p> The Sophists, with whom a new epoch begins in Greek philosophy, return
                            to the view of Heraclitus. While the early Greek philosophers did not
                            question the validity of traditional morality as embodied in the
                            positive laws of the State, the Sophists applied the critical spirit to
                            accepted ethical and religious views. They discriminated between Natural
                            and Positive Law. They taught that positive laws could not be obligatory
                            because they varied so frequently. Positive laws are the arbitrary
                            commands of those in power, framed by rulers for their own advantage.
                            Only such laws can be considered natural or divine as are everywhere
                                observed.<ref id="ref_020" rend="super" target="note_020">2</ref>
                            But though the Sophists recognized the idea of Natural Law it was not
                            with the purpose of exalting Natural Right. They emphasized rather the
                            subjectivity and relativity of truth. Their object was primarily to
                            prove that existing laws and institutions were conventional and
                            variable.</p>

                        <p>Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are not unfamiliar with the conception of
                            Natural Right, though they make little use of it. Socrates distinguishes
                            between written laws which are founded upon custom and unwritten laws
                            which are observed everywhere, being given to the human race by the gods
                            and not framed by the hand of man.<ref id="ref_021" rend="super"

                            which conforms to the dictates of Nature. He speaks of a universal sense
                            of right which, in a certain degree, all persons possess intuitively. He
                            refers to the famous utterance of Antigone, who declared it to be right
                            to bury Polynices, even though she violated a royal command, because the
                            burial was by nature a deed of justice, the law enjoining it having been
                            in force, not for this or the next day, but forever, no one knowing from
                            whom it proceeded.<ref id="ref_022" rend="super" target="note_022"

                            <hi rend="i">Rhetoric</hi> I. 15 Aristotle speaks of the universal law
                            as being more absolutely just than the written law, and as continuing in
                            force forever, whereas written law frequently varies. <hi rend="i"
                                >Rhetoric</hi> I. 10, 3 he classifies laws as general and peculiar,
                            the latter being those by whose written enactments men guide themselves,
                            while the former consist of those written rules which seem to be
                            recognized among all men. <hi rend="i">Rhetoric</hi> I. 15, 25 Aristotle
                            again refers to universal principles of right. </p>

                        <p>In the works of the Stoics we find the theory of Natural Law fully
                            developed. It was in accord with their system of metaphysics. They
                            believed that every corporate entity is permeated by God, whom they
                            conceived as the <hi rend="i">Logos,</hi> that is, as universal reason.
                            They believed God to be immanent in Nature--to be the world-soul.
                            According to their view God rules the universe by means of a universal
                                law.<ref id="ref_023" rend="super" target="note_023">2</ref> This
                            law they believed to be the rule of action for every being in existence.
                            The universe is one. The law which is immanent in Nature and penetrates
                            the being of man, is the absolute standard, above space and time,
                            independent of human regulations--the absolute criterion of right and
                            wrong.</p>

                            tribes and States. It was, in Cicero's time, the universal law of all

                            tenets.</p>

                        <p>The Stoic doctrine of the natural equality of all men, by coloring Roman
                            jurisprudence, resulted in making laws more general, in weakening the
                            force of race differences, and in improving the lot of the slaves. The
                            latter were by Seneca and his Stoic successors regarded as human beings
                            meriting brotherly treatment.<ref id="ref_040" rend="super"

                        <p> There are two tendencies among the Roman jurists, the one represented by
                            Ulpian, extending Natural Law to all living creatures, the other
                            represented by Gaius, Paulus, and Marcian, limiting Natural Law to
                            mankind alone.</p>

                        <p> Ulpian distinguishes two branches of Natural Law, the one including the
                            entire animal world, the other embracing mankind only. The former rests
                            upon instinct and applies to the union of the sexes, the procreation of
                            kind, and the education of offspring.<ref id="ref_041" rend="super"

                            of legitimate matrimony follows the mother; that it is just to repel
                            force by force; that all living things have a common ownership of the
                                elements.<ref id="ref_042" rend="super" target="note_042">3</ref>
                            This is the view of Natural Law adopted by Justinian.<ref id="ref_043"
                                rend="super" target="note_043">4</ref> Ulpian defines theft and

                        <p>Gaius and Paulus differ from Marcian in their views on the Law of Nature

                            objective intelligence or reason in this nature of things, the Natural
                            Reason (ratio naturalis), whose product is Natural Law. This is
                            Montesquieu's view when he defines laws as necessary relations derived
                            from the nature of things. In this sense all beings have their laws.<ref
                                id="ref_045" rend="super" target="note_045">1</ref> Marcian,
                            however, shares the Stoic view, regarding the Law of Nature as the Law
                            of the entire Universe, extending tis scope far beyond simple justice.
                            According to this view, Natural Justice is only a part of Natural Law.
                            Marcian considers God as dwelling in Nature, and as being the source of
                            Natural Law, which is itself Reason, rather than merely a product of
                            Natural Reason. Marcian holds, in common with Gaius and Paulus, that
                            Natural right is absolute justice applying to all human beings, even to
                                slaves.<ref id="ref_046" rend="super" target="note_046">2</ref> One
                            of the most striking deductions that were made from Natural Law by the
                            roman jurists was that according to it all men are from the beginning
                            born free.</p>

                        <p>Just as Natural Law and the <hi rend="i">jus gentium</hi> were fused,
                            though at first distinct, so Natural Law was by the later Roman jurists
                            identified with the principles of equity.<ref id="ref_047" rend="super"
                                target="note_047">3</ref> Such were the views of the Greeks and

                        <p>It will be remembered that the Laws of Nature were conceived of by

                        <p>things and as being distinct from the positive laws of the State. These
                            Laws of Nature, though not enforced by material force of any sort, are
                            morally binding upon the individual; indeed, they form the supreme
                            standard of action; all other laws ought to be tested as to whether or
                            not they conform to the Laws of Natural Justice, and positive laws
                            conflicting with them, so the Stoics held, are not to be obeyed. Natural
                            Law thus limits the omnipotence of the State. The despotism of the State
                            was, as we have seen in a previous connection, the chief hindrance to
                            the growth and development of individual liberty in the ancient world.
                            Unfortunately, Natural Law was still in too rudimentary a stage to be of
                            much influence upon the genesis of private rights. It had not yet
                            formulated any specific rights, like that of freedom of conscience, of
                            speech, and other individual rights, to which the citizen should be
                            entitled. The ideas of the natural liberty and equality of all men do,
                            however, seem to have had considerable effect upon Roman laws in the way
                            of rendering them more equal and just than they might otherwise have
                            been.</p>

                        <p> It is important, nevertheless, that the conception of Natural Law was
                            formed by the ancients, for, after subsequently receiving a wider
                            development, it became in modern times a factor in the enfranchisement
                            of the individual whose importance can scarcely be overestimated.</p>

                        <p>While the ancients believed in the sovereignty of the State, the German
                            barbarians, who overthrew the Roman empire, believed in the sovereignty
                            of the individual. Our modern liberty goes back to them primarily. Their
                            devotion to personal liberty was so great that it was inimical to all
                            government which was not</p>

                        <pb id="VAB1855-041" n="27"/>

                        <p>self-imposed. They hated cities, which the ancients regarded as essential
                            to a complete life, and lived in the forests. They chose their own
                            chieftains. They regarded the payment of taxes as a sign of serfdom. No
                            one can read the <hi rend="i">Germania</hi> of Tacitus and the other
                            memorials of this people without being struck by this excess of the
                            individualistic spirit. Thus was the Greek and Roman view of sovereignty
                            supplanted by the German idea of liberty. It must not be supposed that
                            the feudal system annihilated individual freedom. On the contrary,
                            feudalism was individualism unrestrained; feudalism was the product of
                            the Teutonic love of liberty and hatred of control. But this almost
                            uncontrolled liberty was for the upper classes alone. Unfortunately, the
                            primitive economic equality had been undermined by inequalities in the
                            possession of land, which favored the growth of an aristocracy. The
                            depression of multitudes to serfdom went on apace. These serfs were but
                            the property of their lords. In England the primitive liberty of
                            Teutonic times was soon restored by abolishing serfdom and extending to
                            the lower classes the liberty which they had lost. A like development
                            might have resulted on the Continent but for the revival of the Roman
                            notion of the omnipotence of the State, or rather of the ruler of the
                            State, which was a consequence of the revival of the Roman law, from
                            whose influence England escaped. But even on the Continent the Teutonic
                            individualistic spirit broke out with fresh fervor during the great
                            religious Reformation of the sixteenth century, which was essentially a
                            product of the Germanic spirit united with the spirit of primitive
                                Christianity.<ref id="ref_048" rend="super" target="note_048"

                        <p>This brings us to the consideration of another factor of importance in
                            the genesis and development of modern liberty; namely, Christianity.</p>

                        <p>Christianity plainly teaches the equality of all men before God, a notion
                            which has again and again proved to be a levelling force to which no
                            other can be compared. The words of Christ, "Render unto Cæsar the
                            things which are Cæsar's, and unto God the things that are God's,"<ref
                                id="ref_049" rend="super" target="note_049">1</ref> as well as the
                            words of the apostles, " We ought to obey God rather than meni,"<ref
                                id="ref_050" rend="super" target="note_050">2</ref> are a
                            declaration of war against the ancient view of the omnipotence of the
                            State. Here is a sphere; namely, whatever concerns conscience, within
                            which the interference of the State will not be tolerated. The
                            individual is thereby enfranchised. The Roman emperors did not fail to
                            recognize the meaning of this; therefore they adopted the policy of
                            bitter persecution. To acknowledge freedom of conscience would have
                            meant to consent to a limitation of sovereignty.</p>

                        <p>A third factor in the evolution of individual liberty, and one of great
                            importance, is the influence of Natural Law, which passes from Roman
                            jurisprudence into the literature of the Middle Ages, and from thence
                            into modern thought. From Natural Law the creed of modern liberty and
                            democracy develops.</p>

                        <p>The Christian religion renders this conception more acceptable and
                            plausible to the Middle Ages than it would otherwise have been, because
                            it possesses a conception analogous to that of Natural Law. Thus Paul
                            speaks of the Gentiles as doing by nature the things commanded by the
                            law written in their hearts.<ref id="ref_051" rend="super"

                        <p>Nor were the church fathers unfamiliar with this notion. Irenmus, in
                            describing the divine plan of educating the human race, holds that God's
                            purpose is to be carried out by means of the Natural Laws implanted in
                            man's nature, to which he owes obedience. He believes that the
                            patriarchs were already familiar with these laws. During the sojourn in
                            Egypt they were forgotten. God, therefore, had them inscribed in the
                            Decalogue. Christ did not abrogate the old law, but only expanded it,
                            retaining all the Laws of Nature.<ref id="ref_052" rend="super"

                            natural and rational. As God did not foresee, dispose, or ordain
                            anything without reason, so He wishes that nothing should be treated or

                            one of the chief works on Canon Law throughout the Middle Ages, begins
                            with a consideration of Natural Law. It declares divine law to rest upon
                            human nature, while human laws rest upon custom. </p>

                        <p>"Natural Right is common to all nations because it rests upon the

                        <p>(1225-1274), the greatest teacher of the Middle Ages. Aquinas
                            distinguishes four kinds of laws: 1. The eternal law,<ref id="ref_059"
                                rend="super" target="note_059">1</ref> constituting the plan
                            according to which God created the universe and governs it; 2. Natural
                                Law,<ref id="ref_060" rend="super" target="note_060">2</ref> which
                            is a derivation from the eternal law, being the impression of the divine
                            light in man; 3. Human laws,<ref id="ref_061" rend="super"
                                target="note_061">3</ref> which are deductions from the precepts of
                            Natural Law, designed to regulate certain affairs more particularly; 4.
                            The divine law,<ref id="ref_062" rend="super" target="note_062">4</ref>
                            which is revealed in the Scriptures.<ref id="ref_063" rend="super"
                                target="note_063">5</ref></p>

                        <p>Aquinas teaches that though there exists no universal earthly state, nor
                            universal human law, there is a universal divine law, which is the
                            highest reason, existing in God, and which is the source of all other
                            laws. Natural Law is not in its essence different from the divine law,
                            but is simply that part of the latter which is known to rational beings.
                            Implanted in man at his creation, it has ever since survived in the
                            human conscience. Man learns this Natural Law directly through the light
                            of Natural Reason. But while man knows the divine law only in part, God
                            knows it in its entirety. Natural Law existing in the nature of things,
                            is not instituted by any human authority, and is unchangeable. According
                            to this law things occur by necessity, while those actions with which
                            human laws deal are performed because commanded. Whoever obeys the
                            dictates of Natural Law is a virtuous man, for virtuous actions are
                            agreeable to nature, while criminal or vicious actions are contrary to
                            nature and reason.<ref id="ref_064" rend="super" target="note_064"

                        <p>of Natural Law is to do right and avoid doing wrong.</p>

                        <p>Aquinas distinguishes three branches of Natural Law, according as it
                            applies to all substances, to all animals, or to mankind only. " First,"
                            says Aquinas, " there is in man an inclination toward that which is good
                            by nature, which he shares with all substances, and according to which
                            each substance strives after selfpreservation. As a result of this
                            inclination those things pertain to Natural Law by which the life of man
                            is preserved and injuries warded off. Then there is in man an
                            inclination toward other things more especially according to Nature,
                            which he shares with other animals; in accordance with which tendency
                            those things are according to the Law of Nature, which Nature teaches to
                            all animals, of which class are the conjunction of male and female, the
                            education of offspring, and the like. Finally, there dwells in man an
                            inclination toward that which is good according to the nature of reason,
                            which tendency is confined to man; thus, man has a desire to know the
                            truth concerning God, and a longing to live in society; wherefore those
                            things pertain to Natural Law which apply to this inclination, to which
                            class belong the injunction that man should shun ignorance, that he
                            should not offend his associates, and other matters of like nature."
                                <ref id="ref_065" rend="super" target="note_065">1</ref> Aquinas
                            maintains that no government can command what is contrary to Natural Law
                            without becoming tyrannical. This amounts to an acknowledgment of the
                            limitation of sovereignty. He regards it as the duty of the ruler to
                            secure the common welfare.<ref id="ref_066" rend="super"

                            as of the feudal lords, prevented the development of individual liberty
                            during the Middle Ages, except so far as the privileged classes were
                            concerned.</p>

                        <p>As a result of the intimate union between Church and State which had been
                            brought about by Constantine, the temptation to employ the power which
                            had now been placed at her disposal became too great for the Church to
                            withstand. The Christian faith, which had hitherto spread by virtue of
                            its inherent strength, was now extended by the employment of force.
                            Heresy was suppressed as the worst of crimes. Freedom of thought was
                            extinguished. The religion which had at its origin been so remarkable a
                            factor in promoting the enfranchisement of the individual, became,
                            during the Middle Ages, an instrument of his enslavement. There is but
                            one qualification which must be made to this statement: the Church,
                            though inimical to liberty, did endeavor to secure as large a degree of
                            equality as possible, by working for the abolition of serfdom.</p>
                        <p> Not only had the influence of Christianity as a factor in the evolution
                            of individual liberty been diminished, but the other factor in this
                            process, namely, the individualism of the Teutonic peoples, had likewise
                            failed to accomplish what it might have, had not the growth of feudalism
                            weakened its force. Feudalism</p>

                        <p>divided medieval society into sharply separated classes. The individual
                            was rated as a member of this or that caste, not as a man. While the
                            lords enjoyed a freedom which was almost unrestrained, the serfs were
                            bound to the soil, being deprived completely of freedom. In England the
                            effects of feudalism were gradually obliterated. The privileged classes
                            joined hands with the lower classes against the king. As a result of
                            this union not only was the king's power restricted, but liberty was
                            extended to the common people. The process of elevating the lower
                            classes went on without interruption in England. Magna Charta, as early
                            as 1215, enumerated and guaranteed the liberties of the English people.
                            Parliament, especially after the establishment of the House of Commons
                            in 1265, acted as a check upon the royal power. Upon the Continent a
                            different development took place. In France, the kings eventually
                            succeeded in curbing the nobles with the assistance of the common
                            people, especially of the cities. But only limited powers were conferred
                            upon the municipalities, while little was done to emancipate the serfs.
                            While the political power of the great nobles was at last broken, their
                            feudal privileges were left almost untouched. Not until the Revolution
                            was feudalism finally abolished in France. The French kings had
                            succeeded in building up a despotic power. Undoubtedly they were aided
                            in this by the victory of the Roman spirit of centralization and
                            sovereignty over the Germanic spirit of individualism and liberty. The
                            revival of Roman Law and the insistence of the legists upon the
                            doctrine, "What the king wills has the force of law,"<ref id="ref_067"

                        <p>as a force in building up a royal despotism. In Italy the establishment
                            of tyrannies in the cities, which had enjoyed a brilliant, but
                            short-lived, existence as republics, llikewise rendered individual
                            liberty nugatory. In Germany the growth of a strong central power, such
                            as in France, did not take place. The nobles of Germany succeeded in
                            appropriating the powers of government in their domains, and, except in
                            case of the cities, many of which were practically republics with a free
                            and prosperous population, the lower classes in Germany were kept in
                            complete thraldom.</p>
                        <p> However, both the individualism of Christianity and of the German nature
                            experienced a revival during the great religious Reformation of the
                            sixteenth century. The great reformers aimed to return to primitive
                            Christianity and revive its spirit. This movement was in its effects a
                            revolution of the most far-reaching consequences. The fact that it was a
                            product of the Germanic spirit is evinced plainly enough by its having
                            taken hold of the Germanic peoples of northern Europe alone. These are
                            also the nations whose inhabitants possess the widest degree of liberty
                            to-day. Although the political consequences of the Reformation did not
                            manifest themselves at once, although Luther, Calvin, and others
                            preached the doctrine of passive obedience to the powers that be, and
                            had but little sympathy for political questions or for civil liberty,
                            the results of this movement upon the enfranchisement of the' individual
                            could not but show themselves sooner or later. For what the reformers
                            demanded for themselves was freedom of conscience. They attacked the
                            principle of authority. It is true they put the authority of the Bible
                            in the place of that of the pope, but this altered the case materially.
                            The Bible is a book that</p>

                        <pb id="VAB1855-051" n="37"/>

                        <p> must be interpreted. Each individual is likely to form his own opinion
                            of its teachings. Toleration must follow as a result of the principle of
                            Protestantism. This did not result until experience demonstrated the
                            impossibility of controlling the consciences of men. With the
                            acknowledgment of freedom of conscience the individual is practically
                            enfranchised. The sovereignty of the State once limited in this respect,
                            will still further be limited by the granting of other personal rights
                            with which the State must not interfere. But what of the theory of
                            Natural Law, which is the theoretical side of this process? With the
                            advance of education the influence of theories is intensified. Natural
                            Law furnishes the programme of the individual rights for which the
                            people of the civilized countries of western Europe contend. To follow
                            its development becomes, therefore, a task of great importance.
                            Melanchthon, the friend and helpmate of Luther, the "preceptor of
                            Germany," deserves the credit of having introduced the conception of
                            Natural Law into modern thought. He said that in civil affairs he looked
                            to Cicero rather than to the Scriptures. It is likely that he adopted
                            his views concerning the Law of Nature from Cicero. Melanchthon divides
                            laws into natural and positive. The former are rays of divine light in
                            the human soul and are unchangeable, while the latter, founded upon
                            possible, not upon necessary, grounds, are variable.<ref id="ref_068"

                            standard of justice among men, though not sufficient to the justice of

                            the nature of God, it is best to return to faith. It is more convenient
                            to extract the Laws of Nature from the Decalogue, where</p>

                            reason.</p>

                        <p>Melanchthon failed to deduce positive law from Natural Law, though he
                            asserted the priority of the latter. This was done by Oldendorp, a
                            syndic and professor at Rostock. Oldendorp discriminates clearly between
                            Natural Law, the law of nations, and civil law, and attempts to
                            construct a complete system of Natural Law.<ref id="ref_069"
                                rend="super" target="note_069">1</ref> But, like Melanchthon, he
                            shrinks from using reason alone, and therefore falls back on the
                            Decalogue as the clearest exposition of Natural Law.</p>

                        <p>The attempt to deduce Natural Law methodically from human nature, without
                            recurring to the Scriptures, was first made by Hemming, a professor at
                                Copenhagen.<ref id="ref_070" rend="super" target="note_070">2</ref>
                            Winkler, a professor at Leipzig, like wise wrote an extensive treatise
                            on Natural Law."<ref id="ref_071" rend="super" target="note_071"
                            >3</ref></p>

                        <p>Albericus Gentilis, professor of Law at Oxford University, wrote a
                            treatise <hi rend="i">On the Right of War,</hi><ref id="ref_072"
                                rend="super" target="note_072">4</ref> which in many respects
                            anticipated the celebrated book of Grotius. Grotius had a great
                            admiration for Gentilis, and repeatedly acknowledged his indebtedness to
                            him. Gentilis regards the Law of Nature as being concealed in the
                            recesses of nature and as forming a part of divine law. Though darkened
                            in many particulars, it may nevertheless become known to man. According
                            to Gentilis, Natural Law is discovered spontaneously and is more
                            powerful than any other law.</p>

                        <p>In 1594 appeared the first four books of Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity,
                            the first of which contains his exposition of Natural Law. Hooker
                            defines a law in general as a rule to goodness of operation. There are
                            various kinds of laws: the divine law which God has set down to follow
                            in His works; the law of natural agents that work either by simple
                            necessity or of their own accord; the law which the angels obey; the law
                            guiding voluntary agents, dictated by reason; the positive laws for
                            multitudes and political societies; the laws of each nation; those
                            concerning the fellowship of them all, and finally the law which God has
                                revealed.<ref id="ref_074" rend="super" target="note_074">2

                            not be able to formulate each particular law of Nature, but when once

                        <p>Nature men consider themselves as having originated these laws, but they

                            difficulty. The Laws of Nature bind men absolutely, as men, even though
                            they have no settled fellowship nor have ever agreed as to what to do

                            So long as each thing performs the work that is natural to itself, it
                            preserves itself and other things. Great injury must inevitably result,
                            if man, the noblest creature in the world, yes, himself a world,
                            transgresses the Law of Nature.<ref id="ref_077" rend="super"

                            what must be done; permissory, declaring what may be done; or
                            admonitory, stipulating what is most convenient to be done.<ref

                            man. Natural Reason teaches the main precepts of religion and morality.
                            It teaches men to love one another. The desire of man to be loved by
                            those who are naturally his equals imposes upon each person the duty of
                            treating others as he wishes to be treated himself. From the natural
                            equality of men other principles of Natural Law result of which no man
                            is ignorant, viz.: "Because we would take no harm we must do none";
                            "Since we would not in anything be extremely dealt with, we must avoid
                            all extremity in our dealings"; "We are to abstain from all violence and

                        <p>Because of the corruption of human nature, says Hooker, the Law of Nature
                            requires some form of government. To take away all forms of public
                            government in the world would be apparently to overthrow the whole
                            world. While obedience to Natural Law is demanded by conscience,
                            positive human laws constrain men by force and punish transgression.
                            Natural Laws are valid in their very nature, while positive laws become
                            obligatory only after public approbation has made them so.<ref
                                id="ref_080" rend="super" target="note_080">1</ref></p>

                        <p>Hooker gave a complete exposition of Natural Law thirty-one years before
                            Grotius, the great Dutch writer, who is by many given the credit which
                            belongs to Melanchthon,. Gentilis, and especially Hooker. The famous
                            work of Grotius, <hi rend="i">On the Right of Peace and War,</hi> was
                            not published until 1625.</p>

                        <p>Hooker's <hi rend="i">Ecclesiastical Polity</hi> is one of the few really
                            great books in the world's literature. It contains, either explicitly or
                            in germ, all the leading ideas of the eighteenth century.</p>

                        <p>By declaring the doctrines of religion to be founded in nature Hooker
                            prepared the way for English deism. By stating that the principles of
                            human conduct are likewise founded in nature he became the forerunner of
                            the brilliant English school of writers on ethics.<ref id="ref_081"
                                rend="super" target="note_081">2</ref> This rationalistic spirit is
                            applied by Hooker to every line of human thought. Hooker does not rely
                            upon tradition to prove his assertions. He does not quote the fathers or
                            the schoolmen. He establishes his points by argument, by the use of
                            reason. That signifies a rupture with scholasticism. It means that for
                            the first time the principle upon which modern learning rests is used
                            fearlessly.</p>

                        <p>It was only natural that this rationalistic spirit should be applied by
                            Hooker to politics and law as well. Reason, not tradition, is made the
                            test which is applied to political institutions. The laws founded in
                            reason are the Laws of Nature.</p>

                        <p>Joined with this theory of Natural Law in Hooker's work, we find the
                            doctrine of the sovereign power of the community, the contract theory,
                            the doctrine of the separation of powers, which is often supposed to
                            have been first announced by Montesquieu, and other ideas which were
                            subsequently put forth by Sidney, Locke, and other writers of the
                            seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</p>

                        <p>It was only incidentally, as it were, that Hooker had expressed his views
                            on questions of Natural Law and politics, his chief object being to
                            vindicate the ecclesiastical polity of England. A writer to whom these
                            questions were of prime importance was the famous Dutch scholar Hugo
                            Grotius, whose monumental work <hi rend="i">On the Right of Peace and
                                War</hi>
                            <ref id="ref_082" rend="super" target="note_082">1</ref> exerted a
                            wonderful influence over his time, since it laid the foundations of a
                            new science, modern international law. It is also the first complete and
                            systematic treatise on Natural Law. Grotius was a man of the same stamp
                            as Hooker. Though quoting extensively from ancient and medieval authors,
                            he employed reason in constructing his system, using tradition simply
                            for the purpose of illustrating his arguments. It was he who first
                            separated politics from theology. His great reputation secured a general
                            predominance of his views. From his time on, down to the nineteenth
                            century, almost every writer on government uses the conception of
                            Natural Law. There was a rupture with custom and tradition. Reason was
                            now applied to law and politics.</p>

                        <p>Grotius distinguishes between natural and voluntary laws. The latter have
                            their origin in a will which may be human or divine. Human voluntary law
                            is of three classes: civil law, which proceeds from the civil power
                            ruling the commonwealth; the law of less extent, that does not issue
                            from the civil power, though dependent upon it, and that contains the
                            precepts of fathers, masters, and such like; finally, the law of larger
                            extent, which is the law of nations.<ref id="ref_083" rend="super"
                                target="note_083">1</ref> Voluntary divine law has its rise from the
                            will of God. It was thrice given to mankind: after the creation of man,
                            after the Flood, and in the teachings of Christ. Natural Law is the
                            dictate of right reason showing moral turpitude or moral necessity to be
                            in an act, by its agreeing or not agreeing with rational nature, and
                            therefore with the precepts of the Author of nature, God. Natural Law
                            commands or forbids what is by itself, or in its own nature, due or
                            unlawful; while divine law makes any act lawful or unlawful simply
                            because it is commanded or prohibited by God. Natural Law is immutable.
                            God Himself could not change it. It would exist even if God did not
                                exist.<ref id="ref_084" rend="super" target="note_084">2</ref></p>

                        <p>Grotius adopts the division of law into voluntary and natural from
                            Aristotle. He quotes also the Roman jurists, Cicero, the fathers, and
                            Aquinas. But Grotius introduces a new principle into Natural Law,
                            namely, the social principle. He considers it to be natural for man to
                            seek a life spent in community with his fellow men, and considers this
                            social instinct <hi rend="i">(appetitus socialis)</hi> as the source of
                            Natural Law.<ref id="ref_085" rend="super" target="note_085">3</ref>
                            "This . . . concern for society in conformity with human reason is the

                                >1</ref> But Grotius is not consistent in the use of the social
                            principle as the source of Natural Law. He declares Natural Law also to
                            be the dictate of right reason. He considers reason to be the true
                            nature of man. Man has an inclination to search for reason in all
                            things, so also in law. Reason discerns what agrees with human nature
                            and what does not; what is in accord with the social relations of men
                            and what is not.</p>

                        <p>Natural Law, according to Grotius, can be proved <hi rend="i">a priori
                                and a posteriori.</hi> The former method is more subtle, the latter
                            more popular. The former demonstrates the agreement or disagreement of a
                            thing with the rational and social nature of man, the latter shows what
                            is common to all nations. A universal effect requires a universal cause.
                            Beliefs prevailing among all nations must have a common origin.<ref
                                id="ref_087" rend="super" target="note_087">2</ref></p>

                        <p>In opposition to Carneades and others who declared that there is no
                            universal standard of justice and that the only test of law is its
                            utility, Grotius maintained that there is an essential justice and
                            morality, founded in the nature of things. He affirmed that justice and
                            right should rule among nations and direct both peace and war.</p>

                        <p>Grotius defines the State as the perfect union of free men for the
                            purpose of enjoying the protection of the Law and promoting the common

                        <p>introduced the compact theory into modern thought. He regards private
                            property as having arisen from compact. If any individual has acquired
                            property or any right in a lawful manner, it is contrary to Natural
                            Right to deprive him of it. If a ruler does so, nevertheless, he should
                            make restitution, for he has acted contrary to the true right of the
                            subject. Grotius treats in one of the chapters of his book <ref
                                id="ref_089" rend="super" target="note_089">1</ref> of those things
                            belonging to all men and distinguishes between what is ours according to
                            the common right of men (<hi rend="i">communi hominum jure</hi>) and
                            what belongs to us by our special right. This distinction later became
                            that between inherent, or fundamental rights, and acquired rights, and
                            anticipated the term "Rights of Man" of the eighteenth century.</p>

                        <p>Like all who believe in the compact theory of government, Grotius regards
                            the State as an aggregation of individuals, not as a unit, or organism,
                            or State in the true sense. He emphasizes the individual rather than the
                            State. Grotius was a life-long champion of individual liberty. While the
                            fierce religious conflict was raging in Holland between the Arminians
                            and Gomarists, he advocated religious toleration and throughout his life
                            endeavored to conciliate religious factions. A born republican, he
                            believed in equality. He asserted that the life, limbs, and freedom of
                            each individual belong to himself alone.<ref id="ref_090" rend="super"
                                target="note_090">2</ref> He was untrue to his own principles,
                            however, when he said that an individual might alienate his liberty and
                            even deliver himself into slavery.<ref id="ref_091" rend="super"

                        <p>and celebrated jurists and antiquarians of his time, called by Grotius
                            the "glory of England," endeavored to prove that reason is not the
                            source of Natural Law. According to him reason is too uncertain and
                            inconstant and lacks sufficient authority to make the precepts of
                            Natural Law obligatory.<ref id="ref_092" rend="super" target="note_092"
                                >1</ref> He believes in the existence of Natural Laws, however, and
                            regards them as universal laws, the laws of the world, as God's way,
                            word, mandate, and footprint. He says they will always remain firm and
                            immutable. While denying that they were originally written in the
                            conscience of men and discoverable by reason alone, he asserts that they
                            were supernaturally revealed to the first generation of men; namely, the
                            Noachids, and were then spread among the Greeks, Romans, and other
                            peoples of antiquity. These primitive laws revealed to the sons of Noah
                            he regards as a complete and wonderful resum6 of all the laws and duties
                            of society. What makes Selden's views still more strange is that he
                            finds these laws in a book so little known as the Talmud. These prime
                            Laws of Nature prohibit the worship of idols and of other gods, save the
                            one Supreme Being; blasphemy; the spilling of human blood; cruelty to
                            animals; and enjoin respect of marriage and the ties of blood, of
                            property, and of justice, as well as the laws of one's country.<ref

                            he considered things according to their nature as discovered by

                            advocate of liberty of conscience, "which above all other things ought
                            to be to all men dearest and most precious."<ref id="ref_096"

                            a more devoted champion than John Milton. He advocated the separation of

                            forerunner of american ideas of government and personal freedom.</p>

                        <p>With Hobbes Natural Law assumes quite a different character. It becomes
                            intimately associated with a state of nature. While Grotius believed man
                            to be a social creature, Hobbes declared man to be naturally selfish and
                            anti-social. He says that by nature men are equal as regards qualities
                            of soul and body,<ref id="ref_097" rend="super" target="note_097"

                            industry. Peace is suggested by certain articles called Natural Laws
                            which are derived from reason. These laws are precepts by which each
                            person is prohibited from doing that which tends to his injury. They are
                            eternal and immutable. What they forbid can never be commanded, and what
                            they enjoin can never be forbidden. They are one with the moral law.<ref

                        <p>Hobbes formulates about a score of what he calls Laws of Nature, all of
                            them principles of morality or practical wisdom, such as the following:
                            That each person should be useful to others; that no man should despise
                            another; that in inflicting punishment the future good, rather than the
                            magnitude of the past offence, is to be considered; that all men are by
                            nature equal; that such things as cannot be divided should be used in
                            common; that messengers of peace should be safe; that in every
                            controversy decision should be made by arbiters; that each person should
                            do unto others as he would have them do unto him.<ref id="ref_0105"

                            Hobbes, recommend that the state of nature, which is a state of

                            regards the monarchy as the best. He constantly confuses the State with
                            the ruler of the State. The State has unlimited control over the
                            property, the opinions, and the religious beliefs of the citizens. It is
                            true that Hobbes regards it as the duty of the ruler to secure the

                            citizen has but to obey the law. Hobbes defines Law as the command of
                            that person whose will is the foundation of obedience. In such a state
                            as this there exists no sphere of individual rights. The ideas of

                            the despotism of the State. What, however, could be more illogical than
                            to suppose that men would voluntarily exchange their natural freedom for

                        <p> Spinoza regards Natural Laws as rules of Nature determining the

                            Natural Right lies in the nature of things. The right of Nature as a
                            whole, and of each individual, extends as far as his power. From this
                            standpoint might is right. The power of natural things, by which they
                            exist and act, is the power of God. Every man has as great a right to
                            Nature as he has power to hold it.<ref id="ref_0111" rend="super"

                            neighbor as if it were his own), this persuasion has but little
                            influence over their passions. But each desires to live in peace and
                            safety, and to be free from fear. This is impossible so long as every
                            one does what passion dictates. To live in security men must combine,
                            each surrendering his individual rights to the community. A compact is

                            commands of the chief authority, for now that has become Right which
                            supreme authority declares to be so. But the duty to obey ceases as soon
                            as the supreme authority has lost the power to enforce its commands.<ref

                        <p>Bossuet, Archbishop of Meaux, considers all laws to be founded on the

                        <p>are gods on earth. Though the royal authority is regarded as subject to
                            reason, there is little left to the subject of a state such as Bossuet
                            describes but to obey and to serve.</p>

                        <p>Fénelon (1651-1717), the rival of Bossuet, and Archbishop of Cambray,
                            defines law in general as the rule which each being ought to follow in
                            order to act according to its nature. The most perfect law for finite
                            wills is that of the Infinite Will, which is Natural Law. This law is
                            common to all beings and is eternal and immutable. The Supreme Law is to
                            love everything according to the dignity of its nature. From this flows
                            respect and love of God; respect for, and good-will toward, all
                            particular beings created by God; patriotism; and all other civil and
                            political virtues. The general welfare should, according to this law, be
                            preferred to any particular interest. Disobedience and lack of attention
                            to it do not destroy the force and justice of Natural Law. It is not
                            founded upon the accord of nations and legislators, but upon the
                            immutable relations of our being with all that surrounds it.<ref

                        <p>In Germany Samuel Pufendorf (1632-1694) attempted to harmonize the views
                            of Grotius and Hobbes. He was the first professor of Natural Law and
                            occupied a chair at Heidelberg specially created for him. He taught
                            Natural Law as a science and applied to it the geometrical method which
                            Descartes had applied to metaphysics and Spinoza to ethics. He enjoyed a
                            great reputation in his day and deserves to be better known in our
                            own.</p>

                        <p>Pufendorf accepts two principles as leading to the formation of the
                            State: The social nature of man and the fear of injury. According to him
                            the necessity and</p>

                        <p>truth of Natural Law flow from the constitution of human nature, from
                            which it can be deduced by reason. But inasmuch as it does not determine
                            who shall command and who obey, and puts no penalties on disobedience,
                            it is insufficient to preserve society; therefore men must determine by
                            compact who shall prescribe positive laws and punish disobedience.
                            Pufendorf defines law as the command of a superior to his inferiors to
                            act in a prescribed manner. Laws should accord with reason, but must be
                            obeyed because they are commanded, even if the reason for them be not
                            obvious. Though founded in reason, Natural Laws presuppose the existence
                            of God in order to have binding power. They are obligatory because of
                            divine injunction. Like all living creatures, man strives to preserve
                            himself. Every man is part of a greater entity. He must be concerned for
                            the welfare of this greater whole, which is society. The Law of Nature
                            enjoins all actions which conduce to mutual sociableness.<ref
                                id="ref_0124" rend="super" target="note_0124">1</ref> The two
                            fundamental laws of Nature are: (1) that each individual preserve his
                            body, his members, and all belonging to him; and (2) do not disturb, but
                            benefit, society. The obligation to cultivate social life is equally
                            obligatory upon all.<ref id="ref_0125" rend="super" target="note_0125"

                            He calls it absurd to believe as did Aristotle that some men are slaves
                            by nature. According to Pufendorf all men are naturally, and
                            antecedently to any human deed, born free. Either their own consent or
                            some act done by them causes an abridgment of their liberty. Antecedent
                            to any deed or compact among men, no one has power over another, but
                            each is master over his own </p>

                            ceases and there arises an inequality ibetween sovereign and subject.

                        <p>The work of Grotius and Pufendorf was continued by Thomasius, one of the
                            most enlightened men of all times, an ardent and unwearied advocate of
                            political, intellectual, and religious liberty, and one of the founders
                            of the University of Halle. It is his merit to have separated the
                            sciences of law and morals. He regards morals as pertaining to the inner
                            life, which is beyond outward control. The province of law, on the other
                            hand, he regarded as being the regulation of outward affairs. The
                            principle of morals he declared to be virtue; that of law, justice. He
                            distinguishes between Natural and Positive Law. Natural Laws spring from
                            the nature of things. They are written in the heart of man by God and
                            enjoin the performance of those actions which are in accordance with
                            man's rational nature. Positive laws must be published before they can
                            be known, while Natural Laws are discovered by reason.</p>

                        <p>Thomasius regards the fundamental precept of Natural Law to be to prolong
                            and render happy the life of men and to avoid that which renders life
                            unhappy and hastens death.<ref id="ref_0128" rend="super"

                            abstract of his larger work in 1673, bearing the title, <hi rend="i">On

                        <p>impossible without that of the individual. Likewise, individual happiness
                            is inseparable from that of society. Every individual should labor for
                            the welfare of others as for his own. Reasonable self-love demands that
                            reason rule over sense and that the will -of the individual be
                            subordinated to the will of all. Thomasius distinguishes three spheres
                            of action: decency, virtue, and justice (<hi rend="i">decorum, honestum,
                                justum</hi>). The principle of decency is: Do unto thyself what thou
                            wouldst have others do to thee; of virtue: Do unto others what thou
                            wouldst have others do to thee; of justice: Refrain from doing unto
                            another that which thou wouldst not have done unto thee.<ref

                        <p>Thomasius makes a distinction between Natural Rights, which are derived
                            from Nature and are inherent in man (<hi rend="i">connatum jus</hi>),
                            and acquired rights (<hi rend="i">acquisitum jus</hi>), which arise from
                            human laws. Freedom, the common ownership of Nature's gifts, and the
                            right to one's thoughts, life, and members are inherent rights, while
                            the right to property and the exercise of authority are acquired
                                rights.<ref id="ref_0130" rend="super" target="note_0130"

                        <p>By separating law and ethics Thoriasius established the sphere of inner
                            life, which should be free from outward control. He regards Law as the
                            science of compulsory duties. During his time certain principles had
                            come to be generally accepted by jurists; such as the existence of a
                            state of nature and the rights and duties existing in the same, the

                        <p> In England, Richard Cumberland (1632-1719) attacked the materialistic
                            theories of Hobbes. He maintained<ref id="ref_0132" rend="super"
                                target="note_0132">2</ref> that just as there are fixed principles
                            which govern the physical world, so immutable and universal laws exist
                            which govern the moral world. These he called Natural Laws. They demand
                            that each individual seek his own good, as well as that of society.
                            While Hobbes asserted the selfishness of man, Cumberland maintained the
                            benevolence of human nature <hi rend="i">(amor universalis)</hi>, which
                            he regarded as the sum of Natural Law. The common good is, according to
                            him, the supreme law. According to right reason men are benevolent
                            toward each other and love peace, not war, as Hobbes had affirmed. The
                            fundamental Law of Nature is: Seek the common happiness of rational
                                men.<ref id="ref_0133" rend="super" target="note_0133">3</ref> The

                        <p>among the masses. They became the program of the Whigs. They were the
                            theories of the American and the French revolutions. Locke cannot be
                            called the originator of these ideas, for they had been put forth
                            repeatedly before his day, especially by Hooker, Grotius, and Milton.
                            But they came to be associated with Locke's name, and it was he who
                            secured for them their wide acceptance.</p>

                        <p>Like several of his predecessors, Locke presupposes a state of nature,
                            which he conceives as a state of perfect freedom and equality, in which
                            each person is independent of every other. But this does not imply the
                            reign of license. The state of nature is governed by the Law of Nature,
                            which is binding upon all. "Reason, which is that law," says Locke,
                            "teaches all mankind who will but consult it, that, being all equal and
                            independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty,
                            or possessions." <ref id="ref_0135" rend="super" target="note_0135">1
                            </ref>Every one is bound to preserve himself and the rest of mankind.
                            The life, liberty, health, limbs, and goods of another must not be
                            interfered with. The Law of Nature wills the peace and preservation of
                            mankind. In the natural state the execution of the Law of Nature is,
                            according to Locke, put into the hands of every man. Transgressors of
                            the Law of Nature may be punished in order to prevent its violation. All
                            men are naturally in the state of nature and remain so till by their own
                            consent they become members of political society.<ref id="ref_0136"
                                rend="super" target="note_0136">2</ref> Locke distinguishes, not
                            very successfully, however, between the state of nature and that of war.

                        <p>Against Grotius, Hobbes, and Pufendorf, Locke asserted that man could not
                            by free consent or compact enslave himself or give to another absolute
                            and arbitrary power over himself. This inalienability of freedom was
                            later insisted upon by the Massachusetts patriots, Otis, and John and
                            Samuel Adams, and by the American Bills of Rights. "No man can, by
                            agreement," says Locke, " pass over to another that which he hath not in
                            himself, a power over his own life." Preservation of property is the
                            chief purpose of leaving the natural state and forming government.
                            Though men are free in the state of nature, the enjoyment of their
                            rights is uncertain, inasmuch as the Law of Nature, though plain and
                            intelligible to all rational creatures, is not of sufficient compulsory
                            authority. Known and indifferent judges are also lacking, as is the
                            power to execute sentence. On joining political society men give up the
                            power to execute the Laws of Nature. But though they give up to society
                            their natural equality, liberty, and executive power, it is only to
                            secure life, liberty, and property more effectively. It would be
                            irrational to change one's condition in order to render it worse. The
                            power of society over its members does not extend any further than the
                            common good requires.<ref id="ref_0138" rend="super" target="note_0138"

                        <p>Locke asserts that the earth was originally given by God to all men in
                            common. Every man, he says, has a property in his own person. "The labor
                            of his body and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his." By

                            alone, so that becomes his to which he has joined his labor.<ref

                            free disposition over his property according to his own will, within the

                            </ref> The preservation of property is, according to Locke, one of the
                            chief ends of government. No person, not even the supreme ruler in the
                            State, can take away from any man a portion of his property without his
                            own consent.</p>
                        <p> It was of great importance that Locke, unlike Hobbes and afterward
                            Rousseau, maintained that the Laws of Nature do not lose their force
                            after men enter society. These laws do not only apply in the state of
                            nature. Indeed, after the formation of political society, the force of
                            these laws has increased, for now penalties are attached to breaking
                            them. The Laws of Nature are eternal rules, forming the standard
                            according to which legislators shall frame the positive laws of the
                                State.<ref id="ref_0141" rend="super" target="note_0141">3</ref>
                            Neither do men lose their natural freedom and equality. There is only
                            such a sacrifice of this natural liberty made as is absolutely necessary
                            to the formation of the State and the establishment of government. Men
                            do not relinquish their natural freedom in order to become slaves. They
                            seek security for their natural rights. It is this view from which the
                            idea arises of setting forth the Rights of Man in a solemn declaration,
                            as was done by the Americans in their Bills of Rights, and subsequently
                            by the French in their Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the
                            Citizen.</p>

                        <p>W<hi rend="sc">E</hi> have seen how the conception of the Law of Nature,
                            which originated in early Greek philosophy, has steadily increased in
                            dignity and importance, having been finally worked up into a system by
                            such writers as Grotius, Pufendorf, and Locke.</p>

                        <p>The basis of Natural Law was the idea that there exists an essential
                            justice, which is the same for all men of whatever race or State they
                            might be members. The Laws of Nature were considered as being
                            independent of tradition; as being given with the constitution of man;
                            as being founded in reason, and as being unchangeable by any human, or
                            even divine, power. These Laws of Nature were of course not legally
                            binding upon men, since there was no authority to impose a penalty upon
                            their infraction. But they were regarded as morally binding upon all
                            men. It was a question of <hi rend="i">ought.</hi> The positive laws of
                            every State <hi rend="i">ought</hi> to conform to the Laws of Nature.
                            The citizens of every land <hi rend="i">ought</hi> to enjoy their
                            natural rights; their rights as men; the rights to which the
                            constitution and needs of human nature entitle them. These rights might
                            be denied them in any State; but the denial meant that the government
                            exceeded its just powers and had become tyrannical. Of course, <hi

                            Should it be <hi rend="i">de jure?</hi> Should there</p>

                        <pb id="VAB1855-077" n="63"/>

                        <p>be a sphere within which the State must not interfere; namely, the sphere
                            of the rights each citizen <hi rend="i">ought </hi>to possess as an
                            individual, as a man? These questions were by the writers on Natural Law
                            answered in the affirmative. They often forgot, however, that these
                            so-called Laws of Nature are only morally, not legally, binding.</p>

                        <p>It is evident that the theory of Natural Law is admiraably adapted to
                            become the theory of revolutions, whereby the ordinary course of custom
                            and tradition is interrupted and new standards are sought. When men are
                            dissatisfied with things as they are, they will inquire, How ought
                            conditions be? At such times they will ask for the reason back of
                            customs and institutions.</p>

                        <p>It was but natural that the doctrines of Natural Law should be employed
                            during the American, and more especially during the French, Revolution
                            to attack abuses which had accumulated for centuries. Natural Law taught
                            that men were naturally free and equal; that such rights as freedom of
                            conscience, of religious worship, of speech, of the press, of public
                            meeting, followed from the very constitution of human nature; that,
                            given the personality of man, these rights are absolutely necessary to
                            secure its development. The actual condition of affairs was far from
                            agreeing with these demands of Natural Law in the Europe of the
                            eighteenth century.</p>

                        <p>Not only did the disparity between theory and actual conditions render
                            the doctrines of Natural Law dangerous to the order of things prevailing
                            during the eighteenth century, but the danger had become particularly
                            great, because of the general spread of these views, which was a
                            consequence of the advance and wide dissemination of education.</p>

                        <pb id="VAB1855-078" n="64"/>

                        <p>Natural Law had a peculiar attraction for the people who lived at this
                            period. It was a period during which men were singularly devoid of
                            reverence for the past. The historical spirit was lacking. There was a
                            general longing to be freed from the thraldom of antiquated customs and
                            institutions. The foundations of things were examined. The fact that
                            privileges had existed for ages was no longer regarded as a sufficient
                            title why they should exist forever.<ref id="ref_0142" rend="super"
                                target="note_0142">1</ref> Reason was regarded as the panacea for
                            all human ills. No other age had such a faith in the perfectibility of
                            things. It was believed that the Golden Age could be realized by
                            enthroning Reason. The application of reason to science resulted in a
                            wonderful advance of human knowledge at this time. It was held that laws
                            and political institutions must also conform to reason. The simple and
                            perfect Laws of Nature were regarded as immeasurably preferable to the
                            multitudinous and conflicting laws of the existing type.</p>

                        <p>Another reason for the popularity of Natural Law was the universal desire
                            for individual liberty which marks this epoch. To the people of this
                            period the constant meddling of the government in private affairs,

                            sighed for liberty, for the free disposition of themselves and their
                            property. They longed to be rid of the shackles of custom. As a reaction
                            against paternalism and overcentralization the desire arose to restrict
                            the interference of the State to a minimum. This movement culminated in
                            the writings of Kant, Fichte, W. von Humboldt, John Stuart Mill, and
                            Herbert Spencer.</p>

                        <p> It is interesting to note that the conception of Natural Law found
                            expression in the <hi rend="i">Antimachiavelli </hi>of the young
                            Prussian Crown Prince Frederick, later known as Frederick the Great. The
                            book was written as a refutation of the political principles of
                            Machiavelli, during Frederick's happy Rheinsberg days, between
                            1736-1740. Frederick thinks that before considering the different forms
                            of states, the great Florentine should have examined the origin of
                            princes and discussed the reasons which induced free men to submit to
                            masters. He thinks it might not have been convenient to mention what
                            should remove crime and tyranny, in a book which proposed to defend
                            these. Machiavelli was perhaps unwilling to say that the people found it
                            necessary for their repose and preservation to have judges to regulate
                            their differences; protectors, to shield them from their enemies in the
                            possession of their property; sovereigns, to unite all various interests
                            in a single common interest. He was reluctant to acknowledge that the
                            people had chosen those whom they believed the wisest, the most just,
                            the least biassed, the most humane, and the most watchful, to govern
                            them. "Justice ought to be the chief object of the sovereign. He should
                            prefer the welfare of the people he governs to every other interest.
                            What becomes, then, of those ideas of interest, of grandeur, of
                            ambition, and of despotism? It will be found that the sovereign, far
                            from being absolute master of the people which are under his domination,
                            is but their first servant."<ref id="ref_0143" rend="super"

                        <p>It was from this point of view that Frederick II. regarded his position
                            as king of Prussia. At a time when rulers had adopted the phrase of

                        <p>for their sake, Frederick, influenced by Natural Law and the compact
                            theory, labored for the good of his subjects and conceived himself to
                            be, not the lord, but the first servant, of the State.<ref id="ref_0144"

                            of Prussia. The influence of Natural Law upon the work of the great king
                            can be seen from the following extract taken from his famous Code of
                            Laws: " The good of the State, and of its inhabitants in particular, is
                            the end of the civil association and the universal object of the laws.

                            and his devotion to the welfare of his subjects.</p>

                        <p>The representative philosopher of the eighteenth century was Christian
                            von Wolff, the famous professor at Halle, who, though his works are now
                            seldom read, in his day enjoyed an almost incredible reputation. Even in
                            France his popularity was so great that for a time it seemed as if his
                            works were destined to supplant those of the English writers. Driven
                            from Halle by the pietistical Frederick William I., he was recalled by
                            Frederick the Great. His return to Halle was regarded as an event of
                            national importance. Wolff's influence declined during his later years,
                            but only because his theories had become the common property of his
                            contemporaries. Wolff usually entitles his books <hi rend="i">Sensible
                                Thoughts.</hi> Perfectibility is the corner-stone of his system. He
                            declares it to be the duty of the human race to strive for perfection.
                            He deducts Natural Law from the moral nature of man. The Rights of Man
                            flow from his duties. The former are inherent because they arise from
                            innate duties. Rights and duties are equal for all men because they flow
                            from human nature. All men are naturally equal. Acquired rights alone

                            one has any power over another by nature. From the duty to perfect
                            personality, which is incumbent upon every person, Wolff deduces
                            personal rights, such as the right to self-culture, to the preservation
                            of one's body, to labor. He declares the purpose of the State to be the
                            realization of the common safety and welfare. Each individual sacrifices
                            only so much of his natural liberty as is necessary to secure the common
                                welfare.<ref id="ref_0147" rend="super" target="note_0147"

                        <p>The views of Wolff on Natural Law are practically the same as those of
                            Locke and others. But Wolff contributed greatly to their dissemination.
                            He had a host of followers and disciples. Among them was Vattel, whose
                            Law of Nations, which accords entirely with Wolff's teachings, enjoyed
                            great celebrity in both Europe and America and is frequently quoted by
                            John Adams, Samuel Adams, Otis, Jefferson, and Hamilton.</p>

                        <p>Let us now inquire what the views of the leading French writers were in
                            regard to Natural Law, and what effect their ideas had in preparing the
                            way for the French Revolution.</p>

                        <p>The despotism of Louis XIV. had exerted a blighting influence upon French
                            literature. The recovery from this condition was due to the fact that
                            the French sought for a new stimulus in a different country. This
                            country was England. In science, ethics, rational theology, and
                            political philosophy the English had at this time</p>

                        <p> made a most remarkable progress. The people on the Continent were wholly
                            unfamiliar with the ideas of Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, Newton, and other
                            brilliant English thinkers until after the first quarter of the
                            eighteenth century. After that time English philosophy, science, and
                            principles of government began to spread to France and Germany, and to
                            exert a most salutary influence. It was in England that Montesquieu,
                            Voltaire, and a host of other Frenchmen received their inspiration and
                            many of their ideas. Buckle has carefully collected a list of Frenchmen
                            who visited England, or were familiar with the English language. This
                            list is a very large one.<ref id="ref_0148" rend="super"
                                target="note_0148">1</ref> It was especially the English system of
                            government, and the liberty of the people of England, which filled the
                            French with admiration.</p>

                        <p>During the first half of the eighteenth century it was the Church which
                            the French writers attacked. After 1750 the opposition turns against the
                            State. It is after this date that the chief French books which deal with
                            Natural Law or politics were written. Montesquieu's <hi rend="i">Spirit
                                of the Laws</hi> is an exception to this statement, having been
                            published in 1748.</p>

                        <p>It is with Montesquieu that we must first concern ourselves. He is not
                            really a member of the school of writers on Natural Law, but rather a
                            forerunner of the historical school. He does not believe in abstract
                            justice, neither does he attempt to establish a system of perfect laws
                            or to enumerate the Rights of Man. Montesquieu's method is based upon
                            the relativity of politics. He concerns himself with all forms of
                            government, endeavoring to discover the principles underlying each</p>

                        <p>Yet Montesquieu is familiar with the theory of Natural Law. This
                            conception is, however, of subordinate importance with him. He defines
                            Law in general as human reason, inasmuch as it governs all the peoples
                            of the earth; and considers the political and civil laws of each nation
                            as the particular cases to which this human reason ought to apply.<ref

                            that there is no justice or injustice, except as the laws ordain or
                            prohibit, is to say that before one had drawn a circle the radii were

                                permit.<ref id="ref_0153" rend="super" target="note_0153">5</ref>
                            Writers of the Natural Law school would qualify this definition by

                        <p>Montesquieu distinguishes between political liberty in relation to the
                            constitution and in relation to the citizen. He avoids the error which
                            the ancients committed, and which has so often been made since, of
                            confusing liberty with democracy. This mistake was also made during the
                            French Revolution. It might have been avoided if the views of
                            Montesquieu, rather than those of Rousseau, had been followed.
                            Montesquieu also discriminates between liberty and equality. He regards
                            equality as the principle of the democratic form of government, taking
                            honor to be the principle of the monarchical form and moderation of the
                            aristocratic form. He holds that each form degenerates from an excess or
                            deficiency of its principle; thus a lack or an excess of equality would
                            prove alike destructi to a democracy.<ref id="ref_0155" rend="super"
                                target="note_0155">2</ref> Montesquieu points out the diverse
                            meanings which have been attached to the word <hi rend="i">liberty.
                            </hi>Some regard the power to depose a tyrant as equivalent to the
                            possession of liberty, while some identify liberty with the right of
                            electing the ruler. Liberty is sometimes confounded with the right of
                            bearing arms, or of exercising violence, or of being governed by a ruler
                            belonging to one's own nation; or even, as was the case in Russia, with
                            the right of wearing a long beard. Often liberty has been put in the
                            existence of a particular form of government, such as a democracy, and
                            the power of the people is confused with the liberty of the people.<ref

                            To Montesquieu the indispensable safeguard against tyranny and guarantee
                            of liberty lies in the separation of the executive, legislative, and
                            judicial powers of government, which he believes exists in England.<ref
                                id="ref_0159" rend="super" target="note_0159">3</ref> This doctrine
                            of the separation of powers, though based upon a misconception of the
                            English constitution, had great fascination for the Americans. They
                            carried it out in the constitution of both federal and state
                            governments. It is expressed in most of the Bills of Rights of the
                            states. It was likewise put into the Declaration of the Rights of Man
                            drawn up by the Constituent Assembly. Concerning the doctrines of
                            natural liberty and equality and Natural Rights or Rights of Man there
                            is little or nothing in Montesquieu's book.</p>

                            is Voltaire, the famous poet, philosopher, and wit. Voltaire can hardly
                            be called an individualist. Though a bitter opponent of the existing
                            order of things, he favored such reforming sovereigns as Louis XIV.,
                            Frederick II., and Catherine II. of Russia. He cared very little for the
                            English system of self-government. As Sorel says: "He expected
                            everything from the State, and, at bottom, worked for the State alone. .
                            . . His political ideal is an enlightened despotism tempered by
                            tolerance and reason."<ref id="ref_0160" rend="super" target="note_0160"

                        <p>Voltaire, "we find contrariety, harshness, uncertainty, and
                            arbitrariness. We endeavor in this century to improve everything; let us
                            seek, then, to perfect the laws upon which depend our lives and
                            fortunes." <ref id="ref_0161" rend="super" target="note_0161"/> In
                            theory, however, republican sentiments gain the upper hand. He holds
                            that a perfect government never existed, because men have passions, and
                            if they were without passions, government would not be needed.
                            Notwithstanding, he considers the republican form the most tolerable,
                            because it preserves the natural equality of men more nearly than any
                            other. He maintains that every father of a family should be master of
                            his house alone, and not of his neighbor's, and that, since society is
                            composed of many houses and lands, it is contradictory that a single
                            person be the master of these houses and adjoining lands; and in the
                            nature of things that each master have a voice in the securing of the
                            welfare of society.<ref id="ref_0162" rend="super" target="note_0162"
                                >2</ref> Again, he believes that a republic, being governed in
                            common, should be richer and more populous than if governed by a master,
                            because each citizen, enjoying security of property and person, toils
                            for his own welfare with confidence, and, by bettering his own
                            condition, improves that of the entire society as well.<ref

                        <p>Voltaire often speaks of Natural Right and the Laws of Nature, regarding
                            Natural Right as that which Nature teaches all men. Human laws must be
                            founded upon Natural Right. The grand principle, the universal rule
                            binding all, is: Refrain from do<ref id="ref_0166" rend="super"

                        <p>Voltaire believes in equality, but not in the absolute sense. He holds
                            that all are equally men, having the same needs and desires, but all are
                            not equal as members of society.<ref id="ref_0167" rend="super"

                            public burdens, should be bestowed upon those best able to bear

                        <p>As sensible as Voltaire's views on equality, are his ideas concerning
                            liberty. Liberty is not absolute, but is dependence upon the laws
                                alone.<ref id="ref_0169" rend="super" target="note_0169">4</ref>
                            Enlightenment and liberty go hand in hand. The more eagerly men search
                            for the truth, the more they will love liberty. "The same force of mind
                            which leads to truth makes us also good citizens. What does it mean, in
                            fact, to be free? It is reasoning justly and knowing the Rights of Man;
                            and being known, they will be defended." <ref id="ref_0170" rend="super"

                        <p>The greatest opponents of freedom of thought and of expression were
                            undoubtedly the French clergy. This is one of the reasons why Voltaire
                            assailed the Church with such bitter animosity. The Church seemed to him
                            the chief antagonist of the reforms he longed for so intensely. It was
                            this conviction which inspired the bitter invective he hurled against
                            the Church as a political institution. " The most absurd of all
                            despotisms," he said, "the most humiliating to human nature, the most

                            the right of tigers; yes, as even more horrible, since tigers destroy
                            only to eat, while in France the people mutually exterminate themselves

                        <p>In other ways, also, Voltaire evinced his love of personal freedom. Thus
                            he demands freedom from arbitrary arrest, regarding it as tolerable,
                            perhaps, to imprison a citizen in time of trouble and of war, without
                            giving previous information, or allowing judicial trial, but maintaining
                            that such treatment in time of peace is tyrannical in the extreme.<ref
                                id="ref_0177" rend="super" target="note_0177">2</ref> Again, he
                            opposes sumptuary laws of all sorts, not only on economic grounds, but
                            also because they deprive those who possess property of their natural
                            right of enjoying it, and because they interfere with the liberty of the
                            citizen to clothe, nourish, or lodge himself as he pleases.<ref
                                id="ref_0178" rend="super" target="note_0178">3</ref> Finally,
                            Voltaire opposed feudal dues of all sorts, and thinks there is no
                            possible reason for the distinction between the nobles and the commons,
                            which was in its origin a distinction between lords and slaves. It seems
                            idiotic to him that the larger part of the nation should be degraded for
                            the advantage of a few.<ref id="ref_0179" rend="super"

                            Natural Liberty is defined in the <hi rend="i">Encyclopédie </hi>as the
                            right Nature gives all men to dispose of their person and property as
                            they judge best, being subject to Natural Laws alone. In the state of
                            nature men are independent of each other, but are not independent of
                            Natural Law. By nature men cannot sell, exchange, or destroy themselves;
                            for, naturally, all men are equal, inasmuch as they are not subject to
                            the power of a master and no one has the right of property over them.
                            After entering political society men are entitled to civil liberty,
                            which consists in dependence upon the laws only, and is simply Natural
                            Liberty curtailed by the absence of individual independence and
                            community of property. Most of these ideas are based upon the doctrines
                            of Locke.<ref id="ref_0181" rend="super" target="note_0181">2</ref></p>

                        <p>Holbach, the noted materialist and atheist, truly remarks that the Greeks
                            and Romans did not possess civil liberty because they confused liberty
                            with sovereignty. The day when liberty shall rule lies in the future.
                            Holbach holds that it is the duty of the State to secure the happiness
                            of the citizens. This end can be attained only by allowing the just
                            liberty, whereby each may work for his own interest and well-being
                            providing he does not injure the well-being of his fellow citizens.
                            Freedom exists only in a State whose members are subject, not to the
                            will of man, which is likely</p>

                        <p>free. The natural liberty of man can be interfered with only when it
                            degenerates into license; that is, when it ceases to be liberty and
                            becomes usurpation. It is only the liberty to destroy which ought to be
                            prohibited. There can be no doubt that Turgot here indicates one of the
                            greatest dangers threatening liberty--that, namely, of sacrificing the
                            principle of liberty to the principle of the public welfare, by which
                            both are generally surrendered. Turgot perceived and cautioned against a
                            tendency to which France was particularly inclined and which was
                            destined to prove fatal to personal liberty in that country. " We forget
                            that society is made for individuals," writes Turgot, " that it is
                            instituted only to protect the rights of all in assuring the
                            accomplishment of all mutual duties." <ref id="ref_0186" rend="super"

                            of liberty had at length dawned. It seems that Turgot was less sanguine.
                            The words he had written before his rise to power seem prophetic: "
                            Liberty! I say it with a sigh, men are perhaps not worthy of thee!
                            Equality! they desire thee, but they cannot attain thee." <ref

                            principles had long been known. The notion we are speaking of was an
                            American idea. It came to France from the New World, where the Rights of
                            Man were not only proclaimed, but also observed by the government.</p>

                        <p>Nor had the Americans originally imported these ideas from France. They
                            had learned them from English authors, such as Milton, Locke,
                            Harrington, and others, primarily. It must be remembered that these
                            English authors had exerted a wonderful influence upon such French
                            writers as Voltaire, Montesquieu, Holbach, and Turgot.</p>

                        <p> Another English writer must be mentioned whose work was widely read in
                            America and England, and who represents, as it were, the views on
                            Natural Right and individual liberty, which had come to prevail at the
                            outbreak of the American Revolution. This writer is Blackstone, whose
                            famous Commentaries on the Laws of England first appeared in 1765. Burke
                            says that as many copies of this work were sold in America as in
                            England. An American edition was published in 1771, and of this edition
                            1400 copies were sold in advance, the name of John Adams heading the
                            list of subscribers.<ref id="ref_0188" rend="super" target="note_0188"

                        <p>Blackstone divides individual rights into absolute and relative rights,
                            regarding the former as rights belonging to men in a state of nature,
                            "which every man is entitled to enjoy, whether out of society or in it."

                            the first and primary end of human laws is to maintain and regulate
                            these absolute rights of individuals. Such rights as are social and
                            relative result from, and are posterior to, the formation of States and

                            Blackstone regards the absolute Rights of Man as being summed up in the
                            general term Natural Liberty. "This Natural Liberty consists properly in
                            a power of acting as one thinks fit, without any restraint or control,
                            unless by the Law of Nature; being a right inherent in us by birth, and
                            one of the gifts of God to man at his creation; when He endued him with
                            the faculty of free will. But every man, when he enters into society,
                            gives up a part of his Natural Liberty, as the price of so valuable a
                            purchase; and, in consideration of receiving the advantages of mutual
                            commerce, obliges himself to conform to those laws which the community
                            has thought proper to establish." <ref id="ref_0191" rend="super"
                                target="note_0191">2</ref> "This species of legal obedience and
                            conformity," Blackstone proceeds, "is infinitely more desirable than
                            that wild and savage liberty which is sacrificed to obtain it. For no
                            man that considers a moment, would wish to retain the absolute and
                            uncontrolled power of doing whatever he pleases; the consequence of
                            which is that every other man would also have the same power; and then
                            there would be no security to individuals in any of the enjoyments of
                            life." <ref id="ref_0192" rend="super" target="note_0192">3</ref>
                            Blackstone considers the absolute rights of every Englishman to be
                            founded in nature and reason, and regards them as coeval with the
                            English form of government. According to him English rights consist in a

                        <p>The theory of the Roman jurists, that the Roman people conferred their
                            sovereignty upon the emperors by means of the <hi rend="i">Lex
                                regia</hi>, gave rise to the compact theory of government which
                            plays so important a part in the political philosophy of medieval and
                            modern times. The idea of a compact, however, was already familiar to
                            the Sophists and to Aristotle. <ref id="ref_0207" rend="super"

                        <p>With the appearance of Christianity and of the Germans on the scene of
                            history, ancient history closes and a new period begins. These two
                            factors produced an entirely new civilization. Both favored
                            individualism and democracy.</p>

                        <p>Christianity taught that God is no respecter of persons; that in His
                            sight all men are equal; that every individual is accountable to a
                            personal God for all his actions; that there is no human mediator
                            between God and man. Christ is the Saviour of mankind, not of any
                            particular race or people. The God of Christianity does not prefer
                            particular places or peoples. Christianity tore down the barriers
                            between Greeks, Romans, and barbarians, and created a feeling of human
                            brotherhood which supplanted and exceeded in strength the patriotism of
                            the old nations. Christ aimed to break down the barriers not only
                            between the nations, but also between the classes, by endeavoring to
                            elevate the lower classes and so obviate the inequality which ages had
                            hallowed. Christianity contained the germs of a new social and political
                            order. Whenever there is a revival of primitive Christianity, a renewal
                            of the democratic spirit is observable. <ref id="ref_0208" rend="super"

                            priest, who was regarded as representing the gods. His relation to the
                            constituted authorities was one of fidelity rather than of

                        <p>The government of the ancient Germans was thoroughly democratic. The
                            people were the real source of power. The freemen formed the kernel of
                            the people. Slaves were not numerous. Though a nobility existed, the
                            nobles formed no political caste, but only enjoyed a somewhat higher
                            social consideration than the ordinary freemen. Moreover, kings were
                            chosen from noble families only.<ref id="ref_0210" rend="super"

                            were the centres of political life and power. All freemen were members
                            of these assemblies and participated in their deliberations. While the
                            meeting of the hundred seems to have been mainly for judicial purposes,
                            the tribal assembly dealt with the weightiest questions, for it decided
                            concerning peace or war, elected the chiefs, and had control over all
                            matters too important to be left to the chiefs.<ref id="ref_0211"

                            immensely, having also been hallowed by religious consecration, and
                            while a nobility had arisen which was fitted out with the means to make
                            its pretensions felt, the number of freemen was steadily and rapidly
                            diminishing, while that of the dependent class was increasing. Both the
                            Church and the great families were intent upon increasing their
                            possessions and the number of their dependents.<ref id="ref_0223"

                            ruled over a free people who were in general equal. Classes had arisen.
                            Social changes had produced political changes. A powerful aristocracy
                            now stood over against the king. The power of the old assembly of the
                            tribe had become evanescent and was no longer adapted to the new
                            circumstances. A meeting of the tribe had become impossible as the size
                            of the State had increased. Only the army could check the royal
                            authority. There were no representative institutions to succeed the old
                            popular assembly and arrest the disintegrating progress. The
                            administration passed into the hands of the royal officers -the counts
                            and missi. Commendation and the custom of granting benefices produced
                            the feudal constitution of society and disintegrated the State. The
                            ruler was no longer a popular king, but the head of a feudal
                            oligarchy.</p>

                            of the eleventh century, the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people
                            was used by the adherents of the pope to prove that the emperor did not
                            rule by divine right. The German monk, Manegold von Lautenbach, denied
                            that royalty is founded in nature and claimed that it was an office. He
                            believed that a compact had been made between the people and their king.
                            If the king broke this contract and became a tyrant he might be driven
                            away, as one would drive away a swine-herd. The same ideas, which were
                            derived from Justinian's <hi rend="i">Institutes,</hi> are expressed in

                            contend that the will of the people becomes binding and cannot be
                            changed. We have here the views of Hobbes and Locke put forth at this

                        <p>The influence of the ideas and traditions of antiquity during the Middle
                            Ages is strikingly exemplified by the movement that took place in Italy
                            during the middle of the twelfth century, which was chiefly brought
                            about by the fiery eloquence of Arnold of Brescia, a man who was, as
                            regards several of his ideas, many centuries in advance of his time.
                            Half priest, half political reformer, he preached that Church and State
                            should be separated; that the simplicity of the apostolic times should
                            be introduced, the corruption of the Church, the pride and worldliness
                            of the clergy be done away with; and that a republic, with Roman laws
                            and institutions, should replace the feudal State. He declared serfdom
                            to be contrary to the teachings of Christianity and the temporal power
                            of the Church to be a violation of the Scriptures. The Romans, stirred
                            into activity by his eloquence, renounced their fidelity to the pope and
                            restored the Roman senate and republic. The letter written by the Romans
                            to the Emperor Conrad III. contains the following words: "To the most
                            distinguished and famous lord of the city and of the whole world,
                            Conrad, by the grace of God ever august Roman king, the senate and Roman

                        <p>While the above ideas are derived from Justinian's Institutes, Aquinas
                            was influenced by Aristotle and by the conception of Natural Law of
                            Cicero. Like Aristotle, he declared the common welfare to be the purpose
                            of government and considered that government to be unjust which
                            neglected the general good and sought only that of the ruler.<ref

                            moderated. The king must not command anything that is contrary to
                            Natural Law. This law stands above him. Aquinas does not sanction the
                            murder of tyrants by private persons, but he maintains that they may be
                            proceeded against by public authority. As it belongs of right to a
                            society to select a king, so it is not unjust for society to depose him
                            or limit his powers. Faith is not broken thereby even if the society
                            surrendered itself forever, for if the king has not fulfilled his duty,
                            he himself has merited his fate and caused the compact to be broken.<ref

                        <p>Pope John XXII. The great work of Marsilius, the <hi rend="i">Defensor
                                Pacis,</hi> which appeared in 1325, not only vindicated the right of
                            the State against the pretensions of the papacy, but also asserted the
                            sovereignty of the State to rest in the people. He regards the power to
                            make laws as belonging to the people, or to the majority of their
                            representatives, manifesting their will in a general assembly. He
                            considers no other laws obligatory except those passed by the people,
                            for they alone know the interests of the whole body. He calls it the
                            height of injustice that a single person or a few have the power to
                            control all, as if all men were not equal, but the slaves of another. In
                            obeying the laws which issue from the body of the people each citizen
                            obeys but himself. The rulers in the State derive their authority from
                            the people, whose agents and executives they are. They must act in
                            accordance with the wishes and the consent of their subjects. As the
                            legislative power creates the executive, so it may correct or depose it.
                            In reading Marsilius, Ockam, and other publicists of the first half of
                            the fourteenth century, one is struck by the originality and modernness
                            of their thoughts. They seem to us like men of our own day. Marsilius in
                            many respects anticipated the ideas of the <hi rend="i">Contrat
                                Social.</hi> He applies his democratic principles not only to the
                            State, but also to the structure of the Church. He demands that
                            congregations elect their priests. The State shall summon ecclesiastical
                            councils whose members are to be chosen by popular suffrage of the
                            congregations. For a while it seemed as if Ludwig were bent upon
                            realizing the doctrines of his friend and coadjutor, whose influence
                            over him was very great. But though, as it is almost needless to
                            say,</p>

                        <p>Lupold of Bebenburg, Bishop of Bamberg, who died in 1362, believes that
                            the Roman people, meaning thereby the citizens of the Holy Roman Empire,
                            have the power of making laws and of transferring the empire from one
                            dynasty to another, if they see fit to do so, since the people are

                        <p>It was in France that liberal principles throve best. The great French

                            early part of the fourteenth century, introduced among the people ideas
                            of a natural state, in which the people lived in freedom and equality,
                            without property, without strife or fear of each other.</p>
                        <p> In 1380, during the stormy times that characterized the beginning of the
                            reign of Charles VI., the king's chancellor, yielding to the demands
                            made by the people, said in a discourse to them, that, though kings deny
                            it a hundred times, they rule by the consent of the people (<hi rend="i"

                            splendor flows from the sweat of the subjects. The vigilance of the king
                            should procure the people's welfare and allow them to enjoy the charms
                            of repose and ease.</p>

                        <p>The king ought never to abuse his power, but to govern his subjects

                        <p>The theory of the sovereignty of the people exerted an influence upon
                            ecclesiastical affairs during the period of the great councils of the
                            fifteenth century. The highest authority in church affairs was said by
                            the advocates of the councils to rest, not with the pope, but with the
                            entire church or its representatives. Paris took the greatest part in
                            the movement. Its chief representative was John Gerson, the famous
                            chancellor of the University of Paris. With Gerson the conception of
                            Natural Law is fundamental. He enumerates a score of such Laws of
                            Nature, among them that God must be obeyed before man; that God gave men
                            power to build up, but not to destroy, the Church; that it is lawful to
                            repel force by force; that the end gives a right to the means.<ref
                                id="ref_0237" rend="super" target="note_0237">2</ref> The Law of
                            Nature is, according to him, the supreme law. Church councils may
                            create, depose, yes, even kill, popes, but they cannot command what is
                            contrary to Natural Law.<ref id="ref_0238" rend="super"
                                target="note_0238">3</ref> Gerson says that obedience is not due to
                            a king who acts contrary to the interests of his people. In like manner
                            a pope may be deposed if he does not fulfil his duties. The temporal
                            ruler may call together a church council to deal with such a pope.<ref

                        <p>Of like nature were the views of the German publicist, Nicolaus Cusanus,
                            whose <hi rend="i">De concordantia</hi> catholica appeared in 1435. He
                            regards every constitution as being based on Natural Law. Nothing

                        <p>to this law is valid. It is innate, but clearer in the consciousness of
                            some than of others. Those who are most penetrated by it are the natural
                            leaders and lords of men. Inasmuch as all men are by nature equally free
                            and powerful, no authority can be established but by the agreement and
                            the consent of the subjects, that is, by election. The laws, also, can
                            be established only by agreement. There is a general compact of society
                            to obey kings. In a well-regulated State the rulers hold their position
                            by election alone. They are themselves subject to the laws.<ref

                        <p>Like doctrines were put forth by Æneas Silvius Piccolomini, afterwards
                            Pope Pius II. (1458-1464). He believes in a state of nature in which men
                            originally lived after the expulsion from Paradise, in the manner of
                            wild beasts. Discovering that the society of their fellow men
                            contributed to good living, they assembled to form society, built homes,
                            surrounded cities with walls and discovered the arts which heighten the
                            value of life. Civil life suited them wonderfully well. But as there are
                            many favors conferred upon man by his fellows, so there is no injury
                            which does not originate with man. Soon society began to be violated,
                            faith to be broken, peace to be disturbed, injuries to be inflicted upon
                            neighbors--in short, all rights were violated. It was cupidity that did
                            not permit the laws of society to be observed. Oppressed by the more
                            powerful among their number, men betook themselves to one who possessed
                            overtowering strength and virtue, that he might shield the weak and deal
                            out justice to all alike. Thus kingship arose. This dignity was
                            conferred upon an individual for the promotion of public utility and the
                            ministration of justice.<ref id="ref_0245" rend="super"

                            holds the same position in the Church as the king does in his realm.
                            Just as kings who rule badly and become tyrants are at times driven from
                            the kingdom, so the Roman pontiff can likewise be deposed by the Church,
                            that is, by a general council. This no one can deny." <ref id="ref_0247"

                            Constance (1414-1418), and Basel (1431-1443), were dominated by these
                            ideas. The papal power had greatly sunken. Papal infallibility came to
                            be doubted, for several popes alike claimed to be infallible. It was the
                            Schism which made the democratic movement possible. Inasmuch as the
                            right of the emperor to institute popes at his pleasure was at this time
                            denied, the quarrel between rival popes could be settled only by the
                            synods of the entire Church. But the papacy recovered its former power
                            and superiority. Already in 1460 it was forbidden to appeal from the
                            pope to a council. AEneas Silvius, in his youthful days the champion of
                            the supremacy of church councils, after becoming pope, denounced the
                            views he himself had once put forth. In France, however, the democratic

                        <p> We have seen that the Middle Ages were by no means as barren in
                            political thought as is generally supposed. Marsilius of Padua, Manegold
                            of Lautenbach, Ockam, Gerson, Nicolaus of Cues, and others were the
                            forerunners of the Monarchomachists, of Milton, Sidney, Locke, and
                            Rousseau, and put forth nearly all the political principles of the
                            eighteenth century. There is surprisingly little novelty in political
                            thought. Mediawval political ideas were themselves but a reproduction
                            and development of the theories of antiquity--of the Roman jurists, of
                            Cicero, Aristotle, Plato, and other writers.</p>

                        <p> These doctrines exerted but little lasting influence during the Middle
                            Ages. Marsilius's plans were not realized; the restoration of the Roman
                            republic attempted by Arnold of Brescia and Rienzi proved abortive; the
                            Italian republics of the Renaissance fell into the hands of tyrants; the
                            power for a time exercised by the great church councils of the fifteenth
                            century reverted to the papacy.</p>

                        <p>The Middle Ages did not favor individualism. Custom and tradition had too
                            strong a power. Men had little standing as individuals: they were

                            enrich political thought or promote political freedom. Melanchthon
                            declared that rulers have their power from the people and must not act
                            contrary to their will, but this had no further results so far as his
                            political philosophy is concerned. Luther, himself the originator of a
                            revolutionary movement, though demanding freedom of thought and belief,
                            advocated paternalism in political affairs, and turned away from the
                            peasants who applied his principles to temporal matters. The demands of
                            the peasants, as expressed in the famous Twelve Articles, would have
                            changed the entire subsequent development of German history, and would,
                            in many respects, have forestalled the reforms effected by the French
                            Revolution. At times during the Peasants' War really modern thoughts
                            were put forth. The "prophets" of Zwickau preached the equality and

                            was centuries in advance of his contemporaries and anticipated the ideas

                            When the peasants fell into extremes and committed excesses, Luther with

                            taking a fearful vengeance. Luther later gave up his views on passive
                            obedience, though reluctantly. Manly love of freedom and respect for
                            justice supplanted the belief that blind submission was due to the
                            demands of authority. He was forced to this position by circumstances.
                            He had asserted his religious opinions in opposition to the powers that

                        <p>circumstances contributed to make the new faith a force. But at length
                            the Emperor Charles V. intended to proceed against the Protestant
                            heretics. Their destruction seemed imminent. Should they submit or
                            resist? This was the question agitated by the Protestamt theologians,
                            jurists, and princes. Luther, Jonas, Bucer, and Melanchthon drew up an
                            opinion in January, 1539, to the effect that subjects may defend
                            themselves, yes, owe it to God as a duty incumbent upon them, to protect
                            themselves in case the government or any person undertakes to compel
                            them to accept idolatry and forbidden worship. The attempt of a ruler to
                            exercise unjust power over his subjects is to be resisted. As the gospel
                            confirms government, so it also confirms natural and divine rights.
                            Every father is bound to protect wife and children against public
                            murder. There is no difference between a private murderer and the
                            emperor if the latter exercises unlawful power, for public violence puts
                            an end to all duties of the subject to his lord by the right of

                            of non-resistance.</p>

                        <p>While Lutheranism cannot be said to have exerted a great direct influence
                            upon political thought and development, the case was very different with
                            Calvinism. Calvin's ideal was a republic in which aristocratic and
                            democratic elements were blended. He distinguished theoretically between
                            State and Church, but was under the influence of the theocratic views of
                            the Old Testament. He wished Christ and the Bible to reign in both
                            Church and State. His State has a religious</p>

                        <p>mission. We see this theocratic character of the Calvinistic church
                            manifest itself subsequently in the congregations of the Puritans. The
                            early settlers in New Haven and Massachusetts declare the laws of God to
                            be binding upon them and to be the supreme laws of the colony and hold
                            that the State realizes its purpose only by the intimate union with the
                            Church. Calvin does not teach the sovereignty of the people. He regards
                            civil government as ordained of God, the source of all power. He does
                            not acknowledge the right of subjects to rise up against authority, even
                            against arbitrary power. It is true he makes an exception in case
                            temporal rulers command what is contrary to the obedience due to God,
                            but, as if he wished to excuse himself for doing so, insists upon
                            obedience to government in all other respects.<ref id="ref_0258"

                        <p>It is more probable that Junius Brutus, Hotman, Poynet, and other writers
                            known as the Monarchomachists were influenced by the works of John
                            Gerson, Pierre d'Ailly, and the other writers on the conciliar movement
                            than by Calvin's political ideas, as is generally assumed. In France the
                            remembrance of that period and of those famous publicists must still
                            have been fresh at the time the Calvinistic writers put forth their
                            views concerning the murder of tyrants. We shall see presently how the
                            opinions of the great writers on church councils found their way to
                            Scotland and became known to Knox and Buchanan.</p>

                        <p>Of greater influence than Calvin's political ideas was his system of
                            church government. From it grew the Presbyterian and Congregational
                            systems. Of the influence of Congregationalism on the growth of
                            democracy</p>

                        <p>we shall treat later. Luther often spoke and wrote concerning the
                            priesthood of all Christians, but the Lutheran system of church polity
                            was not influenced by democratic principles. Calvin made the laity the
                            vital part of his system, theoretically at least. He permitted the
                            congregation of the faithful to choose their ministers, after these had
                            been examined as to their faith, motives, and ability, and had been
                            accepted as candidates by the body of ministers and by the council.<ref
                                id="ref_0259" rend="super" target="note_0259">1</ref> Calvin says
                            that it is in nowise to be conceded that the Church consists of the
                            assembly of ministers alone. The pastors may not even excommunicate
                            without the knowledge and approbation of the congregation.<ref
                                id="ref_0260" rend="super" target="note_0260">2</ref> The
                            concentration of his system lies in the consistory or presbytery. This
                            body consists of clergy and laymen. The latter outnumber the former. The
                            consistory represents the union of Church and State. Calvin's spirit
                            dominated this body and exercised through it that censorship over the
                            citizens of Geneva which transformed the character of that people and
                            left its impress upon them for many generations.</p>

                        <p>The democratic ideas which manifested themselves at various times during
                            Antiquity and the Middle Ages do not reappear in the writings of the
                            great reformers. Their views were theocratic,. They did not apply to
                            temporal affairs the principles which underlay the great movement they
                            inaugurated. But the consequences of these principles did not fail to
                            make their appearance. The Reformation asserted the right of the
                            individual to think for himself. It was a protest against the</p>

                            spiritual authorities to control the beliefs of men. The demand for
                            freedom to investigate religious truth led of necessity to the demand to
                            inquire into political truth. The inquiry into the title of spiritual
                            authorities could not but result in an examination of the foundations of
                            temporal power.</p>

                        <p> During the latter half of the sixteenth century a group of writers in
                            Scotland and France of the reformed faith give expression to similar
                            political views. They belong to the class commonly called
                            "Monarchomachists," because of their views concerning the murder of
                            tyrants. John Knox and George Buchanan in Scotland, Junius Brutus,
                            generally thought to have been Hubert Languet, and Francis Hotman in
                            France, are the most famous of these publicists.<ref id="ref_0261"

                            <hi rend="i">Tyrannos</hi> of Junius Brutus may be regarded as
                            characteristic. This book appeared in 1579, seven years after the Night
                            of St. Bartholomew. The author declares that subjects must not obey
                            kings who command what is forbidden by the law of God. Submission in
                            such a case would be rebellion against Christ. He legitimizes
                            tyrannicide, asserting that in certain cases it becomes a duty. He asks
                            whether that shepherd is clement who allows the wolf to remain in the
                            fold, and whether he is merciful who permits a host of innocent persons
                            to be slaughtered out of respect for the life of a single individual.
                            This is the Huguenot reply to the massacre of St. Bartholomew. With
                            these writers of the reformed faith the practical object of legitimizing
                            resistance to oppression predominates over mere theoretical
                            interest.</p>

                        <p>The views of Junius Brutus are associated with the theory of Natural Law.
                            It is the prime Law of Nature, he declares, to preserve life and liberty
                            against violence and injury. Nature implanted this law not only in dogs,
                            to be asserted against wolves, but also, and more especially, in man
                            against him who has become a wolf to his fellows.<ref id="ref_0266"

                            by no right, rescinded by no force. If the prince violates it
                            contumaciously he becomes a tyrant. If the people break it voluntarily
                            they may truly be called seditious.<ref id="ref_0267" rend="super"

                            Henry of Navarre became a candidate for the throne of France, Hotman
                            forgot the views he had put forth in favor of election and maintained
                            that nothing was more conducive to the stability of the State than the
                            right of heredity. The accession of Henry IV. put an end to the warfare

                        <p>A number of Jesuits arrived at the same views as the French Protestants,
                            but their purpose in publishing them was a different one. While the
                            latter employed the idea of the sovereignty of the people in a war of
                            self-defence, the Jesuits used it to debase the State, in contrasting it
                            with the divinely instituted Church. Their purpose was the same as that
                            of Hildebrand had been when he declared the State the work of Satan.
                            They wished to show that what men have instituted must eo ipso be
                            inferior to what God has instituted--that is, that the Church, which is
                            of divine origin, is superior to the State. Lainez had contrasted State
                            and Church at the Council of Trent in 1562, setting the Church of God,
                            which did not create itself or its institutions, but was given its laws
                            by Christ, over against human States which freely institute their own
                            government. Originally all power is in the community by whom it is

                            who may transfer it by Natural Right to one or more, as they choose. It
                            depends upon the multitude to select a king, consuls, or other
                            magistrates. If there is a legitimate cause the multitude may change a

                        <p>Mariana, a Spanish Jesuit of great learning, born in 1537, wrote a book,
                                <hi rend="i">De Rege et regis Institutione,</hi> which he dedicated
                            to Philip III., even though his object was to debase the State. He
                            desires a State torn by internal dissensions. He wishes, however, an
                            immutable, independent, and all-powerful Church.</p>

                        <p>He believes in a state of nature. In the beginning, he holds, men
                            wandered about from place to place after the manner of wild animals,
                            bound by no law, subject to no authority. Their number increasing, they
                            seemed to represent the rude form of a people. They selected father or
                            grandfather as leader. They lived in happiness and simplicity. There was
                            no fraud, no falsehood, no inequality. But rabid avarice soon brought
                            robbery, deception, and slaughter into this state. Crime went
                            unpunished. To escape violence and discord men agreed to bind themselves
                            mutually by a compact, and began to look to an individual of superior
                            qualities for justice and faith. He was chosen to prevent domestic and
                            foreign injuries, to institute equity, and to bind all by equal right.
                            Thus arose the State and royal majesty.<ref id="ref_0275" rend="super"

                        <p>Richard Hooker believes "that every independent multitude" has, before a
                            particular form of government is established, "full dominion over
                            itself." God has endued mankind naturally with the power to choose
                            whatever kind of society it wishes. " That power which naturally whole

                            people. Power resides in both body politic and ruler; in the one

                        <p>A Frenchman, Jean Bodin, is the first person in Modern Times who
                            undertook to define and inquire into the nature of sovereignty.<ref
                                id="ref_0280" rend="super" target="note_0280">2</ref> The word
                            itself is of French origin. Bodin considers sovereignty to be one of the
                            characteristics of the State. He regards sovereignty as the unity of
                            political power. It is absolute power and is irrevocable. He alone is
                            sovereign who possesses the supreme power in the State.<ref
                                id="ref_0281" rend="super" target="note_0281">3</ref> But Bodin
                            commits the mistake of confounding the power of the State with that of
                            the supreme organ in the State.<ref id="ref_0282" rend="super"

                        <p>Unlike Bodin, Althusius ascribes sovereignty to the people, not to the
                            ruler. Althusius was a German professor, born in 1557, syndic of the
                            free city of Emden, and a man of great learning and ability. He had
                            studied at Geneva and was imbued with the Calvinistic spirit. His work
                            on politics appeared in 1603 and has the avowed purpose of applying the
                            doctrine of the sovereignty of the people to all parts of the social
                            body. Sovereignty is, according to his view, the necessary attribute of
                            the social body, without which it has no right to the name of State. The
                            property and use of the sovereign rights are inalienably associated with
                            the people in their entirety. Even if the people wished to renounce them
                            and transfer sovereignty to another, they cannot do so any more than an
                            individual can transfer</p>

                            a consideration of the various social groups or associations
                            (consociationes); namely, family, corporation, community, province, and
                            State. He holds that historically the higher forms of association have
                            developed from the lower. The State is the result of development.
                            Necessity impels men to unite. Each association is formed by a compact.
                            It rests upon the consent of its members and has for its end the common

                            "the preeminent power and universal sum of powers giving control over
                            those things which pertain to the welfare and care of both body and soul

                            the people. They elect the chief magistrate in the name of the people.
                            They give him advice and correction. When he cannot perform his duties
                            they appoint a regent. They may offer resistance to tyrannical power and
                            in case of utmost necessity depose the tyrant. The chief magistrate is
                            at the head of the State. There is a compact between him and the people
                            by which he binds himself to administer the kingdom according to the
                            laws of God, of right reason, and of the State, while the people swear
                            obedience to him.<ref id="ref_0289" rend="super" target="note_0289"
                                >1</ref> This contract is binding until broken by one of the
                            parties. If the people break it, the ruler is relieved of his duties. If
                            the chief magistrate violates it, the people may depose him and select a
                            new ruler or form of government.<ref id="ref_0290" rend="super"

                            other authority, and which cannot be overridden by the judgment of any
                            other human will. This power, he says, belongs to the State in general,
                            and to the person or persons who form the supreme authority in the
                            State, in particular.<ref id="ref_0291" rend="super" target="note_0291"

                            He denies that sovereignty is always actually with the people, so that
                            they may correct and punish kings who misuse their power. As any man may
                            sell himself and become a slave, so a people may prefer to relinquish

                            themselves in England during the Puritan Revolution. They were no longer
                            the thoughts of a few scholars only, but had become the common property
                            of an entire religious sect -the Independents. It was only after being
                            popularized in this manner that these theories became of great practical
                            importance. With the victory of Cromwell's army, in which the
                            Independents predominated, it seemed as if the victory of these ideas
                            had been assured, and as if they were to lead to the permanent
                            establishment of a republic. But republicanism was contrary to the
                            temper of the English people. It was, after all, not in England, but in
                            America, that the principles of the Independents were destined to exert
                            their greatest influence. There they gave rise to modern republicanism.
                            From America they spread to France. The French Revolution disseminated
                            them throughout Europe.</p>

                        <p>Luther delivered the church into the hands of temporal princes because he

                        <p>of managing their own church affairs. Calvin admitted the people to a
                            share in his ecclesiastical system, though his church polity was still
                            largely aristocratic. The church system of the English Independents was
                            entirely democratic in its nature. The Independents believed in the
                            autonomy of each congregation. They opposed the union of Church and
                            State and all external control. A number of Independents who were
                            accused of denying the royal supremacy, declared in the House of Lords,
                            January 19, 1640, "that they could acknowledge no other head of the
                            Church but Christ; that they apprehended no prince on earth had power to
                            make laws to bind the conscience; that such laws as were contrary to the
                            laws of God ought not to be obeyed; but that they disowned all foreign
                            power and jurisdiction." <ref id="ref_0296" rend="super"
                                target="note_0296">1</ref> The Congregational system was likewise
                            based on the idea that each member of the Church had a right to
                            participate in its administration. Robinson, one of the fathers of
                            Congregationalism, speaking of the "proper subject of the power of
                            Christ," says: "The papists plant it in the pope; the Protestants in the
                            bishops, the Puritans, as you term the reformed churches and those of
                            their mind, in the presbytery; we, whom you name Brownists, put it in
                            the body of the congregation, the multitude called the Church." <ref

                            congregation was a miniature republic. The usual form of constituting a
                            church was by covenant. Robert Browne, who first formulated the
                            Congregational polity, defines a church as "a company or number of
                            Christians or believers, which, by a willing covenant made with their
                            God, are under the government</p>

                            principles. The covenant by which the individual congregation is formed,
                            applied to the State, is the contract theory of government. It was not
                            difficult to conclude that, since any number of individuals could of
                            their own free consent form a congregation, so they could also
                            voluntarily contract to form a State; as the authority rested in the
                            entire congregation, so in the body of the people; as Church members are

                            eventually breed liberal political views. Peter Heylyn, a creature of
                            Laud, attacked the "puritan tenet" "that kings are but the ministers of
                            the commonwealth; and that they have no more authority than what is
                            given them by the people." He regards the Puritan religion as

                            contained the words: "God hath power to create or destroy, to make or

                            and soul are due. And the like power have kings: they make and unmake

                        <p>Against such assertions made by autocratic royalty and servile
                            episcopacy, the Independents declared with Junius Brutus that they would
                            obey the king if he obeyed the law; that sovereignty, the <hi rend="i"
                                >majestas realis,</hi> lay not in the king, but in the people, and

                            found a classical expression in the works of Milton.</p>
                        <p> It was during the Civil War that the Independents came into prominence
                            in England. The "Brownists," as the earliest Congregationalists were
                            called, who made their appearance during the reign of Elizabeth, had
                            almost entirely disappeared by the close of her reign. Most of them had
                            emigrated to Holland. Thus a congregation driven from Scrooby had,
                            together with their John Robinson, sought refuge first at Amsterdam,
                            dam, then at Leyden. Upon this congregation the fate of
                            Congregationalism may be said to have rested, not only because Robinson
                            changed "Brownism" to Congregationalism, but for the reason that this
                            congregation migrated to America and founded Plymouth in 1620. In
                            America Congregationalism found a home and became the prevalent church
                            polity of New England. In England it was known as the "New England way."

                        <p>Among the Independents there were those to whom political questions were
                            of prime interest. Of them Bastwick says: "I myself have heard many of
                            them say that it is unlawful to fight for religion, and they professed
                            that when they went out with the sword in their hands they fought only
                            for the liberty of their consciences and for a toleration of religion,
                            which is a part and branch, as they said, of the subject's birthright."

                        <p>They were known as Levellers and falsely accused of being communists by
                            many of their contemporaries. The theory of Natural Law was at the
                            foundation of their political ideas. They claimed that no laws were
                            valid that conflicted with the Laws of Nature. They held that the people
                            had rights which were "due to them by God's Law of Nature." <ref

                            necessary, and of natural right," the Levellers said, "that the people,
                            by their own deputies, should choose their own laws." <ref id="ref_0315"
                                rend="super" target="note_0315">3</ref> They demanded that laws be
                            grounded upon equity and reason, giving universal freedom to all.<ref

                            religious beliefs were theistic. They looked to the law of righteousness
                            in men, rather than to the Scriptures,<ref id="ref_0317" rend="super"
                                target="note_0317">5</ref> for guidance and instruction. They
                            demanded a reformation of social and political affairs according to the

                        <p>The Levellers used the expression "birthright" frequently, meaning
                            thereby the rights to which every free-born Englishman was naturally
                            entitled by abstract right. Before the Norman Conquest the common

                            servants to him and his Norman soldiers. To the Norman Conquest some of
                            the Levellers, commonly known as Diggers, held the enslavement of the
                            common people to be due. According to them, Charles was the successor to
                            the English crown from William the Conqueror, and all the laws that had
                            been made in every king's reign had but confirmed and strengthened the
                            power of the Norman Conquest, and still held the commons of England
                            under slavery to the kingly power, his gentry, and clergy.<ref

                            that the lords of manor were the successors of the chief officers of the
                            Conqueror and held their land by the power of the sword. They asked
                            whether lords of manor had not lost their royalty to the common land,
                            since the common people of England had "conquered King Charles and

                            freedom from every one," some of the Levellers said, "and became the

                        <p>The Levellers wished the government of England to be by laws and not by
                            men. The laws should be the preservers and protectors of the people's
                            persons and estates. "They ought to decide all controversies and repair
                            every man's injuries." "The rod of the people's supreme judicature ought
                            to be over the magistrates to prevent their corruption or turning aside
                            from the laws." "No man should be subject to the crooked will or corrupt
                            affections of any man." <ref id="ref_0324" rend="super"
                                target="note_0324">1</ref> "All the laws, levies of moneys, war, and

                            time, and that no council table, orders, ordinances, or court
                            proclamations ought to bind the people's persons or estates." "It is the
                            first principle of a people's liberty," they said, "that they shall not
                            be bound but by their own consent; and this our ancestors left to
                            England as its undoubted right, that no laws to bind our persons or
                            estates could be imposed upon us against our wills, and they challenged
                            it as their native right not to be controlled in making such laws as
                            concerned their common right and interests." The laws should be for "the
                            common and equal good of the whole nation." <ref id="ref_0325"
                                rend="super" target="note_0325">2</ref> They demanded the abolition

                        <p>Many of the soldiers in Fairfax's army adopted the principles of the
                            Levellers. These doctrines were suited to the times. Having taken up
                            arms against the king it was but natural that the members of the army
                            should be favorable to republican ideas. In a time of upheaval when the
                            whole constitution of the country was being changed, the theory of
                            Natural Right was seasonable.</p>

                            Wildman, Ewer, Scot, Overton, and Walwyn. On the 9th of October, 1647, a
                            paper called "The Case of the Army" had been drawn up and signed by the
                            agents of five regiments, which had been composed as a protest against
                            the conduct of the officers who were accused of betraying the soldiers
                            by entering into combination with the House of Lords, the Presbyterians,
                            and the king's friends. It protested also against disbanding the army
                            and called on the soldiers not to disperse until their grievances had
                            been redressed and certain conditions fulfilled. The paper demanded that

                            of the Army" was taken into consideration by the General Council of the
                            whole army.<ref id="ref_0329" rend="super" target="note_0329"

                        <p>On the 1st of November a paper of proposals from nine regiments of horse
                            and seven of foot, known as the " First Agreement of the People," was
                            presented to the Council. It gave expression to essentially the same
                            principles as the "Case of the Army." This paper declared the power of
                            the representatives of the nation to be "inferior only to those who
                            choose them," and to include all powers not expressly reserved by the
                            people. The reserves were as follows:</p>

                            might result therefrom. He held that one person would have as much right
                            to appropriate anything necessary for his sustenance and the
                            satisfaction of his desires as another if it were not for the fact that
                            men are under contract, by which each enjoys the undisturbed right to
                            the property he receives from his ancestors, with submission to that
                            general authority which is set up to preserve peace and support the law.
                            This is considered "the foundation of all right any man has to anything
                            but to his own person." <ref id="ref_0333" rend="super"

                            observe or break engagements according as they deemed them just or

                        <p>The Levellers believed in manhood suffrage. "The poorest he that is in

                            . . Every man that is to live under a government ought first by his own
                            consent to put himself under that government. . . . The poorest man in
                            England is not all bound in a strict sense to that government that he

                        <p>Ireton replied that the argument for universal suffrage must be based on
                            absolute natural right--on what is just and due to all inhabitants and
                            not on what is allowed them by the law. It was his opinion that no one
                            had a right to a share in determining the affairs of a country who had
                            no permanent interest in that country.</p>

                        <p>Rainborow held it must be either by the law of God or of man that the
                            meanest person is prohibited from exercising his rights as well as the
                            greatest. He said he could find nothing in the law of God, the law of
                            nature, or that of nations, to the effect that a lord should choose
                            twenty burgesses, a gentleman two, and a poor man none. All Englishmen,
                            he maintained, must be subject to English laws, and no man would deny

                        <p>Wildman asserted that the people had hitherto been enslaved. Their laws
                            had been made by their conquerors. But the people were now engaged for
                            their freedom. "Every person in England had as clear a right to elect
                            his representative as the greatest person in England." Wildman conceived
                            it to be "the undeniable maxim of government that all government is in
                            the free consent of the people." "There is no person that is under a
                            just government or has justly his own unless he, by his own free
                            consent, be put under that government." <ref id="ref_0338" rend="super"

                            principles are: That men are naturally free and equal; that they have

                        <p> Levellers demanded a reformation of the government of England according
                            to republican principles. Their political programme was: No king, no
                            House of Lords; the House of Commons to be the supreme authority, and to
                            be truly representative of the people; periodical parliaments; universal
                            suffrage; equality of all before the law; separation of Church and
                            State; universal toleration to all except papists and exclusion of these
                            only on political grounds; no test acts; no imprisonment for debt;
                            conviction for life, liberty, etc., by jury alone; men's lives to be
                            taken only for murder; freedom of trade and labor; self-government:
                            cities, towns, and boroughs to elect their officers for a year;
                            abolition of all privileges and exemptions; every parish to choose its
                            own ministers.<ref id="ref_0340" rend="super" target="note_0340">1</ref>

                            republicanism, would not go as far as this. Of the first agreement as
                            proposed by the Levellers, which was not even as radical as the third
                            agreement, Cromwell said: "This paper does contain in it very great
                            alterations of the very government of the kingdom, alteration from that
                            government that it has been under, I believe I may almost say since it
                            was a nation . . . and what the consequences of such an alteration as

                            February 5; monarchy was abolished February 7. The Commons now took all

                            resolved: "That the people are, under God, the original of all just
                            powers; that the Commons of England, in Parliament assembled, being
                            chosen by and representing the people, have the supreme power in this
                            nation; that whatsoever is enacted or declared for law by the Commons in
                            Parliament assembled hath the force of law, and all the people of this
                            nation are concluded thereby, although the consent and concurrence of
                            king or House of Peers be not had thereunto." <ref id="ref_0343"

                            intend to sign their own death-warrant by accepting the "Agreement of
                            the People" presented by the army, much less the more radical third

                            was far from resting on the idea of the sovereignty of the people.<ref

                        <p>in its principles. He considers all men to have been born free, inasmuch
                            as they are the image of God. They were born to command, not to obey.
                            Sin brought violence and wrong into the world. To escape common
                            destruction men agreed to bind each other from mutual injury. In this
                            way cities, towns, and commonwealths arose. This is the unhistorical
                            contract theory of the origin of society which was held since antiquity.
                            The people then formed another contract, by which they deputed the power
                            that was naturally and originally in them singly and collectively to
                            kings and magistrates, intending them to be deputies and commissioners,
                            not lords and masters. They were entrusted with power in order that they
                            might execute that justice which each by nature and by covenant must
                            have executed for himself. While magistrates are above the people, the
                            law is above them. Milton considers it to be destructive of law and
                            government to hold that kings are answerable to God alone. "Since the
                            king or magistrate holds his authority of the people, both originally
                            and naturally for their good in the first place, and not his own; then
                            may the people, as oft as they shall judge it for the best, either
                            choose or reject him, retain him or depose him though no tyrant, merely
                            by the liberty and right of free-born men to be governed as seems to
                            them best." <ref id="ref_0345" rend="super" target="note_0345"

                        <p>Milton considers a tyrant to be a ruler who reigns for himself and not
                            for the common good. Such a man may be proceeded against as a common
                            pest. Here, as in other respects, Milton shares the views of the
                            Calvinistic Monarchomachists. He proves from both Old and New Testament
                            and from history that tyrannicide is lawful. He accuses the
                            Presbyterians of hypocrisy </p>

                            subjects had a right to punish their king. He employs all the resources
                            of his learning to prove to them their errors. He draws his arguments
                            from history, literature, and logic. A boundless love of freedom
                            pervades this pamphlet. In reading it one feels the feverish agitation
                            of the time. Though Milton defends tyrannicide, it is not from low or
                            selfish motives he does so, but from the lofty consideration of public
                            necessity.</p>

                        <p>In his <hi rend="i">Defence of the People of England</hi> Milton
                            undertook to efface the impression the fate of Charles I. had made upon
                            Europe. It was an answer to the <hi rend="i">Defensio regia of
                                Salmasius,</hi> a famous French scholar who held a professorship in
                            the University of Leyden, the rendezvous of English royalists. Salmasius
                            was accused of having turned traitor to his former liberal views for
                            love of gain, and of having become the tool of the Pretender. It is
                            necessary to bear this in mind to understand the virulence of Milton's
                            attack upon him. The contention between the two resembled that between
                            Filmer and Locke at a later date, in regard to the principles
                            contested.</p>

                        <p>Milton points out the difference between royal and paternal power, which
                            Salmasius asserted to be identical. While fathers beget their children,
                            he asserted, kings do not make their subjects, but are themselves made
                            by them. A tyrant may be deposed and punished according to his deserts.
                            This Milton endeavors to prove by illustrations from history, and by
                            natural and divine law. The king is for the people. Since the people
                            collectively are superior to him, he has no right to enslave or oppress
                            them. Milton puts forth the theory that royal power is but deputed
                            power. By</p>

                        <pb id="VAB1855-154" n="140"/>

                        <p>natural right men formed governments and set up kings for the
                            preservation of life, liberty, and safety. By natural right they may
                            depose those very persons whom they advanced to the government. "Nature
                            does not regard the good of one or of a few, but of all in general." The
                            people did not exhaust themselves by transferring power to their rulers.
                            This power still virtually resides in them. Power was not settled on the
                            king absolutely as if it were his property, but committed to him as a
                            trust, to be exercised for the public safety and liberty.</p>

                        <p>To the doctrine of divine right, Milton opposes that of the sovereignty
                            of the people. He regards the common welfare as the supreme law and the
                            end of government. Law shall rule in the State, not the pleasure of the
                            prince. Whoever breaks the law must be punished, even though he be king.
                            On every page of this book Milton's reverence for the law, hatred of
                            tyranny, love of individual liberty, and moral earnestness manifest
                            themselves and serve, in some measure at least, to counteract the
                            unpleasant impression left upon the mind by reading the abusive language
                            which the stern Puritan heaps upon his servile opponent.</p>

                        <p>In his Defence Milton declines to decide which form of government is the
                            best. He says that though many eminent men have extolled monarchy, it
                            was under the supposition that the prince excelled in noble qualities
                            and was more competent than any other person to reign. If he is not such
                            a person, no form of government is so likely to degenerate into a
                            tyranny. He believes those persons extremely rare, if they can be found
                            at all, who deserve to be clothed with a power on earth that resembles
                            the power God exercises in heaven, for they must infinitely excel all
                            other men, and both</p>

                        <p>for wisdom and goodness in some measure resemble the Deity.</p>

                        <p>Milton's <hi rend="i">Ready and Easy Way to Establish a Free
                                Commonwealth,</hi> written on the eve of the Restoration, echoes his
                            own disappointment and that of the Independents, at the failure of their
                            hopes for a free government. It is incomprehensible to him how a people
                            calling themselves free, can allow any man to be hereditary lord over
                            them, renounce their freedom, and become servants and vassals. How a
                            people who have fought so gloriously for freedom can change their noble
                            words and actions into the base necessity of court flatteries and
                            prostrations, he declares to be lamentable to think upon. Milton cannot
                            comprehend "how any man who hath the true principles of justice and
                            religion in him can presume to take upon him to be king and lord over
                            his brethren, whom he cannot but know, whether as men or Christians, to
                            be for the most part every way equal or superior to himself; how he can
                            display with such vanity and ostentation his royal splendor, so
                            supereminently above other mortal men; or, being a Christian, can assume
                            such extraordinary honor and worship to himself while the kingdom of
                            Christ, our common king and lord, is hid to this world."</p>

                        <p>Milton believes that civil and religious liberty can exist only in a free
                            commonwealth. He prizes toleration as a sacred right, and expresses the
                            views of the Independents on the subject, who, since Roger Williams'
                            visit in 1644, had made religious toleration part of their political
                                platform.<ref id="ref_0346" rend="super" target="note_0346">1</ref>
                            "Who can be at rest," writes Milton, "who can enjoy anything in this
                            world with contentment, who hath not liberty to serve God and to save
                            his own soul according to the best light</p>

                            revealed will and the guidance of His Holy Spirit?" "This liberty of
                            conscience," he continues, "which above all other things ought to be to
                            all men dearest and most precious, no government is more inclinable not
                            to favor only, but to protect, than a free commonwealth, as being most
                            magnanimous, most fearless, and confident of its own fair proceedings.

                            were in most esteem for virtue and generosity of mind, so it is now
                            known to have most in doubt and suspicion them who are most reputed to
                            be religious."</p>

                        <p>But not only is religious freedom most certain in a free commonwealth,
                            Milton holds, but also the enjoyment of civil rights and advancement of
                            every person according to his merit.</p>

                        <p>It was in America that the ideas of Milton were most completely realized.
                            One cannot fail to be struck with the similarity of his views to those
                            of the fathers of the American republic. There is also hardly a single
                            idea in Locke's political philosophy which is not already found in
                            Milton's writings.<ref id="ref_0347" rend="super" target="note_0347"

                            countrymen. But</p>

                            himself greatly indebted to the "great and incomparable" Harrington.<ref

                        <p>The <hi rend="i">Oceana</hi> appeared in 1656. The first part of the book
                            treats of the principles of government; the second, of the art of making
                            a commonwealth; the third, of the effect of such art; the fourth, of the
                            consequences of such a government. The principles contained in the book
                            resemble those of the Levellers in many instances.</p>

                            proposes to himself." Sidney asserts that nations are left to the use of
                            their own judgment in making provision for their own welfare, and that
                            there is no lawful magistrate over any people but such as they have
                            themselves set up. In creating their magistrates, he affirms, the people
                            do not seek the advantage of these, but their own interest.<ref

                                >2</ref> His view of the origin of government is the following:
                            "Every number of men, agreeing together and framing a society, became a
                            complete body, having all power in themselves over themselves, subject
                            to no other human law than their own. All those that compose the
                            society, being equally free to enter into it or not, no man could have
                            any prerogative over others unless it were granted by the consent of the
                            whole. Nothing obliging them to enter into the society but the
                            consideration of their own good, that good, or the opinion of it, must
                            have been the rule, motive, and end of all that they did ordain. It is
                            lawful, therefore, for any such bodies to set up one or a few men to
                            govern them, or to retain the power in themselves. And he or they who
                            are set up, having no other power but what is so conferred upon them by
                            that multitude, whether great or small, are truly by them made what they
                            are, and, by the law of their own creation, are to exercise those powers
                            according to the proportion and to the ends for which they were given."

                        <p>had all shown themselves during the Puritan Revolution -such ideas as the
                            contract theory, government being based upon the consent of the
                            governed, the right of resisting a ruler who has violated faith with his
                            people, the natural liberty and equality of men, and other kindred
                            theories which, during the French Revolution, were to upset the entire
                            existing social and political order. Sidney is one of the most famous
                            exponents of these ideas.</p>

                        <p>Most of these political doctrines were accepted by the Whigs, who are to
                            be regarded as the descendants of the Independents. The Whigs brought
                            about and justified the bloodless Revolution of 1688, which drove James
                            II. from the English throne. The Convention affirms concerning the
                            matter: "That King James the Second, having endeavoured to subvert the
                            constitution of the Kingdom, by breaking the original Contract between
                            King and People, and having, by the advice of Jesuits, and other wicked
                            persons, violated the fundamental laws, and withdrawn himself out of
                            this Kingdom, has abdicated the Government, and that the throne is
                            thereby vacant."</p>

                        <p>The theories of the Independents and Whigs, especially as expressed in
                            the works of Sidney, and of John Locke, the leading Whig political
                            philosopher, also found many advocates in France. Bourdaloue, the famous
                            preacher at the court of Louis XIV., preached them from the pulpit, even
                            in the presence of royalty.<ref id="ref_0369" rend="super"

                            1688 that these doctrines spread on the Continent. Sidney's <hi rend="i"

                        <p>Before we consider the influence of these doctrines on Rousseau we must
                            show how they found an expression in the famous work of Locke on Civil
                            Government. John Locke regards the legislative power as supreme in the
                            State. To it all other parts of the government must be subordinate. But
                            the legislative power is only fiduciary. There rests "in the people a
                            supreme power to remove or alter the legislative." When the trust placed
                            in it is violated the power devolves back to the people who gave it.
                            Whenever the liberties and properties of the subjects are subverted, the
                            community may use its supreme power. "No man, or society of men, having
                            a power to deliver up their preservation, or consequently the means of
                            it, to the absolute will and arbitrary dominion of another, whenever any
                            one shall go about to bring them into such a slavish condition, they
                            will always have a right to preserve what they have not a power to part
                            with, and to rid themselves of those who invade this fundamental,
                            sacred, and unalterable law of self-preservation, for which they entered
                            into society. And thus the community may be said in this respect to be
                            always the supreme power, but not as considered under any form of
                            government, because this power of the people can never take place till
                            the government be dissolved." <ref id="ref_0371" rend="super"

                            lawful power acts without authority and may be opposed as any other man
                            who by force invades the rights of another." If "illegal acts have
                            extended to the majority of the people, or if the mischief and
                            oppression has lighted only on some few, but in such cases, as the
                            precedent and consequences seem to threaten all, and they are persuaded
                            in their consciences that their laws, and with them their estates,
                            liberties, and lives are in danger, and perhaps their religion too, how
                            they will be hindered from resisting illegal force used against them I

                            From this it will be seen that Locke is the theorist of revolutions. The
                            foundation of his political system is the sovereign power of the
                            community. The end of all government is the good of the people.

                        <p><hi rend="sc">NOTHING</hi> could be more erroneous than to attribute to
                            Rousseau's influence the formation of the French Declaration of the
                            Rights of Man. As we shall endeavor to show, it was from America that
                            the French learned of the idea of such a declaration. It was not from
                            Rousseau the Americans derived their principles. In reality Rousseau's
                            political philosophy, which aimed at securing freedom and equality, was
                            destructive to individual rights. He has the individual surrender all
                            his rights, without retaining a remnant of them, to the sovereign people
                            or <hi rend="i">volonté générale.</hi> By this contract the individual
                            exchanges "his natural liberty and an unlimited right to all he holds
                            and is(able to obtain" for the civil liberty which is limited by the
                            general will.<ref id="ref_0377" rend="super" target="note_0377">1</ref>
                            Though Rousseau asserted liberty to be inalienable, though he believed
                            that equality would be preserved by having all individuals alike
                            sacrifice the sum total of their liberties to the sovereign of which
                            each individual is a part, he nevertheless established a despot whose
                            power is as autocratic as is that of the <hi rend="i">Leviathan</hi> of
                            Hobbes. This tyrant is Demos. The views of Rousseau could not give rise
                            to the Declaration of the Rights of Man because he holds that each
                            individual, upon entering society, surrenders his natural rights
                            completely, without retaining the least residuum. Rousseau's <hi

                            rights of the individual. To lose sight of this is to oversee one of the
                            cardinal points of his system. It was the English theorists, notably
                            Milton and Locke, who had insisted upon the fact that the natural rights
                            of the individual were inalienable. It was their view that gave rise to
                            the Declaration of the Rights of Man, not Rousseau's. Again the latter
                            maintains that upon the sovereign people no law of any kind can be
                            binding. Neither is any guarantee necessary, for the sovereign can never
                            intend his own injury. Whatever the sovereign wishes ought to be.
                            Obviously this view militates against any reservations of individual
                            rights.</p>

                        <p>Yet though we cannot give Rousseau the credit of having given rise to
                            this declaration, we must regard him as the apostle of a new social and
                            political era. Though his works are full of contradictions and visionary
                            ideas, probably no writer ever exerted a greater influence than he. That
                            is largely due to the fact that he was the true child of his time. He
                            was oppressed by the abuses and evils of the old régime and longed for a
                            more natural condition of affairs. It is this desire for freedom which
                            characterizes him as it does his contemporaries. It was this desire for
                            liberty, for naturalness, which appealed to them. Most of them did not
                            see the real consequence of his political system until the Reign of
                            Terror opened their eyes to the fact that sovereign Demos may become as
                            great a tyrant as any king. It is therefore safe to say that though the
                                <hi rend="i">Contrat Social</hi> did not beget the Declaration of
                            the Rights of Man, the enthusiasm with which the idea of such a
                            declaration met in France was due in no small part to the writings of
                            Rousseau. A brief consideration of his doctrines will, therefore, not be
                            out of place.</p>

                        <p>"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains. Many a person
                            considers himself lord over his fellows, and yet is more of a slave than
                            they. How has this change taken place? I know not. How can it be made
                            legitimate? I believe I can answer that question." Thus Rousseau begins
                            his <hi rend="i">Contrat Social.</hi> These words define the purpose of
                            that work.</p>

                            change his might into right, obedience into duty." Might, says Rousseau,
                            does not confer right. Since no man has a natural power over his
                            fellows, there is no other foundation of lawful power among men except
                            what arises from contract.<ref id="ref_0378" rend="super"

                            successful because he confuses liberty with democracy.</p>

                        <p>When men have arrived at a point where the single efforts of individuals
                            do not suffice to overcome the obstacles that are pernicious to men's
                            preservation in the natural state, this original condition can last no
                            longer without leading to the destruction of the human race. Since men
                            cannot produce new forces they must combine existing forces and have
                            them work as a whole. This combination can be formed only when a number
                            combine their efforts. How can this be achieved without sacrificing the
                            strength and freedom of each individual? How can a "form of association
                            be found which defends and protects with the entire combined force the
                            person and property of each individual associated, and by which each,
                            uniting himself to all, obeys but himself and remains as free as

                            social contract is the solution of this problem.</p>

                        <p>The stipulations of this contract are so constituted that the least

                            pronounced, they are everywhere accepted tacitly. If the contract is
                            broken, each individual receives his original rights and natural liberty
                            again, losing the freedom which rested upon contract, to obtain which he
                            relinquished his natural rights. All these stipulations may be reduced
                            to a single one, namely, the alienation of each person with all his
                            rights to the entire community. If each gives up himself entirely the
                            condition is alike for all and equality is preserved. No one is
                            interested in rendering the relation which is the same for all, onerous

                            possesses. "Each of us gives to the community his person and all his
                            power under the supreme direction of the general will, and we receive

                            says Rousseau, produces a moral and collective body composed of as many
                            members as the assembly has voices. The association gives to the body
                            resulting therefrom its unity, its common self <hi rend="i">(son moi
                                commun),</hi> its life, and will. This public person is called
                            republic or body politic. When passive it is a State; when active,
                            sovereign; when compared with other like bodies, power. In regard to
                            those associated, the name people is employed. Each individual is a
                            citizen when considered as a participant in the sovereign authority, and
                            a subject when submitting to the laws of the State.<ref id="ref_0383"

                        <p>This contract between the individual and the State being mutual, binds
                            the individual as a member of the sovereign to the other members, as
                            member of the State to the sovereign. The sovereign cannot be bound
                            toward himself; he can impose no law which he could not break. Inasmuch
                            as the sovereign can consider himself only in one and the same relation,
                            he is in the same situation as a private person contracting with
                            himself. There is no sort of fundamental obligation for the body of the
                            people, not even the social contract.<ref id="ref_0384" rend="super"
                                target="note_0384">3</ref> The sovereign owes his existence to the
                            sanctity of the contract. He can therefore never bind himself to
                            anything which would cause an alteration of this contract. He can never
                            alienate any portion of himself.</p>

                        <p>Rousseau regards freedom as unalienable because based on the equality of
                            all. This equality itself results from the absolute reciprocity of the
                            relinquishment each individual has made to the sovereign. Freedom is not
                            given up even though natural rights are exchanged for civil rights. The
                            association compels its members to be free, for if a single member of
                            the body politic is harmed the whole body suffers. The sovereign's
                            interests are identical with those of each individual. There is no
                            necessity for any guarantee to the subjects, that is, for a declaration
                            of their rights which the sovereign must not transgress, for the body
                            can impossibly wish to harm its members. The sovereign is always what he
                            ought to be.<ref id="ref_0386" rend="super" target="note_0386">2</ref>
                            "That which man loses by the social contract," says Rousseau, "is his
                            natural liberty and the unlimited right to all he possesses and is able
                            to obtain. What he gains is civil liberty and property in all he
                            possesses. . . . It is necessary to distinguish natural liberty, which
                            has no limits but the power of the individual, from civil liberty, which
                            is limited by the general will; and possession which is the result of
                            force, or the right of first occupancy, from property, which can only be
                            founded upon a positive title." <ref id="ref_0387" rend="super"

                        <p> Rousseau concludes his first book with the words which he declares to be
                            the base of his system: "The fundamental compact does not destroy
                            natural equality, but substitutes a moral and legitimate equality for
                            the physical inequality nature may have put between men, so that though
                            they be unequal in strength or intellect, they all become equal by
                            convention and right." <ref id="ref_0388" rend="super"

                        <p>In the second book of the <hi rend="i">Contrat Social</hi> Rousseau
                            investigates the nature of sovereignty. He declares it to be the
                            exercise of the general will. It can never be alienated. The sovereign,
                            being a collective being, can only be represented by himself. The power
                            may be transferred, but never the will.<ref id="ref_0389" rend="super"
                                target="note_0389">1</ref> Sovereignty is not only unalienable, but
                            also indivisible. It is the general will, not a particular will; the
                            will of the body of the people, not of a, part. It is only the general
                            will that possesses sovereignty and makes the law. The will of a
                            particular person is at most a decree.</p>

                        <p>To divide sovereignty in its object, says Rousseau, that is, into force
                            and will; legislative and executive powers; rights of taxation, of
                            justice, and of war; is to make of the sovereignty a fantastic being
                            formed of related parts. The error arises from considering as parts of
                            this authority what are only emanations from it. The rights which are
                            held to be parts of sovereignty are subordinated to it. They all
                            presuppose a supreme will which is only executed by them.<ref

                        <p>"The general will," Rousseau holds, "is always in the right and always
                            tends to public utility. This is not saying that the decisions of the
                            people are always equally right. Though any person always wishes for his
                            best, it is not always possible to see what is best. The people cannot
                            be corrupted, but they are often deceived. It is only then that they
                            seem to wish what is evil." <ref id="ref_0391" rend="super"

                            interest and is but the sum of particular wills. If the extremes be
                            taken from the sums of the individual wills, there remains the general
                            will.</p>

                        <p>Rousseau considers freedom and equality the greatest good. Every system
                            of legislation should have their realization for its end. Liberty is
                            necessary because the dependence of any individual reduces the force of
                            the State. Equality is necessary because liberty cannot subsist without
                            it. By equality it is not necessary to assume that degrees of power and
                            wealth be absolutely the same. But power must never become violence, and
                            must never be exercised except by virtue of office and the law. No
                            citizen should be so rich as to be able to purchase another, nor so poor
                            as to be compelled to sell himself.<ref id="ref_0392" rend="super"

                        <p>In the third book of the <hi rend="i">Contrat Social</hi> Rousseau enters
                            upon a consideration of government. He declares every free action to
                            result from a moral and a physical cause. The first determines upon the
                            action, the second executes it. The body politic possesses both power
                            and will. The latter constitutes the legislative, the former the
                            executive, function. Without their cooperation nothing can happen in the
                                State.<ref id="ref_0393" rend="super" target="note_0393">2</ref></p>

                        <p>The legislative power belongs to the people and can belong to them alone.
                            The executive power cannot in the same way belong to the whole body. The
                            executive power has to do only with private acts, which are not laws,
                            and therefore not acts of sovereignty. "The public force requires an
                            agent who unites it and puts it into action according to the directions
                            of the general will, who connects State and sovereign and performs in
                            some sort in the public person what the union of body and soul does in
                            man. This is the government of the State, which is often confounded with
                            the sovereign, whose servant it is." <ref id="ref_0394" rend="super"

                        <p>Rousseau's ideal is a pure democracy. According to him it is not

                            sanctity and inviolability with that of the highest officer. When the
                            sovereign is present there are no longer representatives.<ref

                        <p>The political doctrines of Rousseau were not new. His political
                            philosophy was eclectic. From Locke he learned that men are free and
                            equal. From Hobbes he borrowed his principle of absolutism, but while
                            Hobbes ascribed absolute power to the prince, Rousseau puts it into the
                            hands of the people. The doctrine of the sovereignty of the people had
                            not been forgotten since put forth by the ancients. Rousseau's view of
                            this doctrine resembles that of Althusius in many particulars. One
                            cannot determine what Rousseau owes to Althusius, for while he mentions
                            the names of persons whom he attacks, such as that of Grotius, he passes
                            over in silence the names of those to whom he is indebted. The English
                            political philosophers had declared the supreme authority to lie in the
                            people. But they held the power of the people to be latent and to break
                            forth only in case of tyranny. Rousseau regards the power of the people
                            as being constantly in activity. They are the real sovereign.</p>

                        <p>While other writers had regarded the people as being only in passive
                            possession of sovereignty, Rousseau considers them to be constantly
                            exercising their sovereign power. Herein he differs from Milton, Sidney,
                            Locke, and others.</p>

                        <p>written in 1772, Rousseau endeavors to carry his principles into
                            practical effect. There is nothing in that pamphlet that concerns us
                            here.</p>

                        <p>There is no suggestion of a Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the
                            Citizen to be found in any of Rousseau's writings. Indeed, as we have
                            seen, such a declaration is not in accord with his political philosophy.
                            He does not believe that individuals reserve rights when they agree to
                            form political society. On the contrary, they surrender all their
                            natural rights to the sovereign <hi rend="i">volonté générale.</hi></p>

                        <p>On the other hand, the enthusiasm with which Frenchmen hailed the
                            American idea of a Declaration of the Rights of Man was in no small part
                            due to the influence of Rousseau's writings. He had familiarized them
                            with the doctrines of the sovereignty of the people, of liberty and
                            equality. Though he conceived these ideas in a different sense from what
                            the Americans did, the difference in conception probably escaped most
                            Frenchmen.</p>

                        <p>The great mistake of Rousseau is the error committed by all writers who
                            believed in the contract theory. Like them Rousseau proceeds from the
                            individual to the State. His view is entirely unhistorical. He fails to
                            see that the State is an organism; that a collection of individuals can
                            never become a unity.<ref id="ref_0401" rend="super" target="note_0401"

                        <p><hi rend="sc">THE</hi> theory of natural rights was already known to the
                            Greeks; that of the sovereignty of the people was put forth frequently
                            during ancient and medieval times, and yet in Europe neither of these
                            theories had given rise to a Declaration of the Rights of Man. Not even
                            during the seventeenth century, when both these theories were in England
                            held by the Levellers, by Milton, Sidney, Locke, and others, did such a
                            declaration result.</p>

                        <p>The question naturally arises, Why did the Declaration originate in
                            America?</p>

                        <p>The answer must be sought in the character, history, and peculiar
                            conditions of the American colonists. Most of the colonists had been
                            driven from their native land by political or religious oppression. They
                            were men to whom their liberties were dear. They were mainly Englishmen,
                            than whom no other people was more</p>

                        <pb id="VAB1855-178" n="164"/>

                        <p>devoted to freedom. Furthermore, the time when they had emigrated was one
                            of great ferment in England; a time when the spirit of opposition to the
                            assertions of royal prerogative and to the encroachments upon popular
                            rights made by autocratic kings was at its height. They held the most
                            liberal religious and political views of their time. Many were
                            Independents who opposed the union of Church and State and demanded
                            liberty of conscience as a sacred right.</p>

                        <p>Their democratic principles of church government gave rise to a
                            democratic political spirit.</p>

                        <p>Each congregation was a miniature republic, electing its pastor and
                            church officers and, while independent of all others, having absolute
                            control over its own affairs.</p>

                        <p>There were many other dissenters besides the Independents scattered
                            throughout the colonies--Baptists, Presbyterians, Quakers, and others.
                            This was a fact of great importance for the subsequent history of
                            America. Religious liberty and political freedom have ever gone hand in
                            hand. There is but a step from religious dissent to political
                            opposition.</p>

                        <p> Men who had suffered persecution for their beliefs, who had braved the
                            dangers of the sea, and had undergone the privations and sufferings
                            incident to the settlement of a new and uncultivated land, were not
                            likely to submit to oppression and infringement of their political
                            liberties.</p>

                        <p>The colonists tried to procure the most liberal charters possible, and a
                            large part of their early history relates to the attempts made to obtain
                            such charters and to compel the enforcement of their stipulations after
                            they had been secured.</p>

                        <p> All the colonies possessed their own local legislatures,</p>

                        <pb id="VAB1855-179" n="165"/>

                        <p>although the early charters made no provision for such bodies.<ref
                                id="ref_0402" rend="super" target="note_0402">1</ref></p>

                        <p>The colonists would not be subject to arbitrary power, but insisted upon
                            having a share in making the laws by which they were governed. Without
                            such participation in framing the laws there seemed to them to be no
                            guarantee for political and civil liberty.</p>

                        <p>After the Restoration there was not a single colony in which the people
                            were not represented in their colonial legislatures.<ref id="ref_0403"
                                rend="super" target="note_0403">2</ref></p>

                        <p>While the right of the people to frame their laws was not questioned in
                            the colonies having proprietary or charter government, this right was
                            sometimes denied in the provincial governments by the Crown, which
                            claimed the right to withdraw this privilege and to decide what number
                            of representatives should be chosen and from what places. The Crown also
                            claimed the right of dissolving the legislative body or continuing it
                            indefinitely without a new election. To these claims of royal
                            prerogative, except that of dissolving the legislature, the colonists
                            opposed the most vehement resistance. Struggles took place repeatedly
                            between them and the crown.<ref id="ref_0404" rend="super"

                        <p>The colonial legislatures claimed the exclusive right of regulating their
                            own domestic and internal affairs, insisting especially upon voting
                            their own taxes. A statute passed during the reign of George III.
                            declared that the king, with the advice and consent of Parliament, "had,
                            hath, and of right ought to have full power</p>

                        <p>Since the colonies and the mother country were each determined to
                            maintain the position taken, a conflict between them was inevitable.</p>

                        <p>While Parliament insisted upon its rights of making laws that were
                            binding upon the colonies and of levying taxes upon them, the colonists
                            stoutly resisted all such attempts as violations of their charter
                            privileges and as infringements of their rights as Englishmen. Arbitrary
                            taxation above all things was odious to them. As Burke said in his
                            celebrated speech: "Here they felt the pulse of liberty, and as they
                            found that beat they thought themselves sick or sound." <ref
                                id="ref_0406" rend="super" target="note_0406">2</ref></p>

                        <p>Inasmuch as representation in Parliament was impracticable for them, the
                            colonists demanded that the colonial legislatures have the power of
                            regulating the internal affairs of the colony and of levying taxes. They
                            acknowledged their allegiance to the Crown, but they would not admit the
                            controlling power of Parliament.<ref id="ref_0407" rend="super"
                                target="note_0407">3</ref> They considered the colonial legislatures
                            sovereign within their territory. They were composed of representatives
                            of all the citizens of the colony.</p>

                        <p>The democratic nature of their political institution and the extent to
                            which they enjoyed the right of self-government could not but breed in
                            the colonists a love of freedom and of individual liberty.</p>

                        <p>The feeling of equality in the colonies was fostered</p>

                        <p>by the general equality of economic and social conditions. There was no
                            native nobility. There were no feudal customs. Land was held in fee
                            simple. Estates were not entailed. The custom of primogeniture did not
                            generally prevail. There was no dependent peasantry, nor were there
                            great estates, except in Virginia. The feeling of caste was lacking.
                            Being absolute owners of the soil and situated in independent and
                            homogeneous circumstances, the colonists loved their liberties and were
                            determined to offer resistance to any infringement of them.<ref
                                id="ref_0408" rend="super" target="note_0408">1</ref></p>

                        <p>The main reason why the liberal principles whose development we have been
                            tracing exerted so great an influence upon the American colonists and
                            were so generally accepted by them, was because they found a basis in
                            the institutions existing in the colonies and because of the historical
                            development of these colonies.</p>

                        <p>The compact theory had an especial meaning to the colonists. It was the
                            Congregationalist Church covenant applied to civil society. The
                            congregation of John Robinson had entered into a covenant before leaving
                            England for Holland.<ref id="ref_0409" rend="super" target="note_0409"

                            constituted a body politic. "We whose names are underwritten," runs this
                            famous agreement, "covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil
                            body politic for our better ordering and preservation and furtherance of

                            Congregationalist minister. In a sermon preached at Hartford, May 31,
                            1638, he had declared "that the choice of public magistrates belongs
                            unto the people by God's own allowance," and that it is in the power of
                            those who appoint officers and magistrates "to set bounds and
                            limitations of the power and place unto which they call them." In the

                        <p>The democratic ideas of Hooker and of Roger Williams found expression in
                            the constitutions of the colonies with whose foundation they were
                            associated.</p>

                        <p> The constitution of the United Colonies of Windsor, Hartford, and
                            Wethersfield, drawn up in 1639, was based upon the doctrine of the
                            sovereignty of the people. It was the first democratic constitution ever
                            formed. The supreme power of the commonwealth resided in the general
                            court whose members were elected by the freemen of the several towns.
                            All magistrates were chosen by the whole body of the freemen. These
                            magistrates were sworn into their office. The governor was required to
                            swear "to promote the public good and peace" of the commonwealth. <ref
                                id="ref_0420" rend="super" target="note_0420">2</ref></p>

                        <p>The Providence Plantations declared in the preamble to their Code of Law,
                            drawn up in 1647, "that the form of government established . . . is
                            democratical, that is to say, a government held by the free and
                            voluntary consent of all or the greater part of the free inhabitants."
                                <ref id="ref_0421" rend="super" target="note_0421">3</ref></p>

                        <p>The democratic political principles of the Independents also found
                            expression in the Constitution of Pennsylvania. Quakerism was but an
                            offshoot of Independency. In America William Penn carried out his ideas
                            of liberty of conscience and of political freedom. The humanitarian
                            spirit of Quakerism is evident in the laws and institutions of the
                            colony which Penn founded.</p>

                        <p>William Penn believed in Natural Law and in the sovereignty of the
                            people. It was very probably from the Levellers that he adopted these
                            theories. Lilburn, the head of the Levellers, spent much time with the
                            Quakers during his last years.</p>

                        <p>Penn regards all laws as either fundamental and immutable, or superficial
                            and alterable. By the first he understands such laws as enjoin men to be
                            honest, just, virtuous; to do no wrong, to kill, rob, deceive, prejudice
                            none, but to do as one would be done unto; to cherish good, and to
                            terrify wicked men; in short, laws derived from Universal Reason. These
                            laws he considers to be subject to no change. No emergency, time, or
                            occasion can ever justify their suspension or abrogation. They "are as
                            the corner-stone of human structure, the basis of reasonable societies,
                            without which all would run into heaps and confusion." While superficial
                            laws, being made for present occurrence, may be abrogated for the good
                            of the kingdom, the fundamental laws continue in force "till houses
                            stand without their foundations and Englishmen wholly cease to be." <ref
                                id="ref_0422" rend="super" target="note_0422">1</ref></p>

                        <p>Apart from these fundamental natural laws, there are, according to Penn,
                            three rights and privileges which form the birthright of Englishmen.
                            These are: 1. An ownership and undisturbed possession. 2. A voting of
                            every law that is made, whereby ownership or property is maintained. 3.
                            An influence upon, and a real share in, that judiciary power that must
                            apply every such law, which is the ancient, necessary, and laudable use
                            of juries.<ref id="ref_0423" rend="super" target="note_0423">2</ref>

                        <p>source of power, Penn says: "The estate goes before the steward; the
                            foundation before the house; people before their representatives, and
                            the creation before the creature. The steward lives by preserving the
                            estate; the house stands by reason of its foundation; the representative
                            depends upon the people, as the creature subsists by the power of its
                            creator. Every representative may be called the creature of the people,
                            because the people make them, and to them they owe their being." <ref
                                id="ref_0424" rend="super" target="note_0423">1</ref> Penn was also
                            an ardent champion of freedom of religious worship. "Liberty of
                            conscience," he said, "we ask as our undoubted right by the Law of God,
                            of Nature, and of our own country." "Nothing is more unreasonable than
                            to sacrifice the liberty and property of any man (being his natural and
                            civil rights) for religion, where he is not found breaking any law
                            relating to natural and civil things."<ref id="ref_0425" rend="super"
                                target="note_0425">2</ref> Again he says: "I ever understood an
                            impartial liberty of conscience to be the natural right of all men; and
                            that he that had a religion without it, his religion was none of his
                            own. For what is not the religion of a man's choice, is the religion of
                            him that imposes it: so that liberty of conscience is the first step to
                            have a religion." <ref id="ref_0426" rend="super" target="note_0426"

                        <p>is characterized by clear logic, breadth of view, and excellent literary
                            style. In its day the book was widely read. In 1772 a new edition was
                            issued. On the list of subscribers is found the name of John Adams and
                            of many of the most influential persons in New England. What makes this
                            brief treatise so interesting to us is the fact that it contains the
                            leading political principles afterward embodied in the documents of the
                            Revolution. It is highly probable that, appearing in a new edition just
                            at the right time, this book exerted great influence upon the fathers of
                            the Republic. Wise applies the principles of Natural Law to the
                            Constitution of the Congregational churches. "Under Christ," he says,
                            "the reason of the constitution of these and the primitive churches, is
                            really and truly owing to the original state and liberty of mankind, and
                            founded peculiarly in the light of Nature." <ref id="ref_0427"
                                rend="super" target="note_0427">1</ref> The excellence of this
                            system he deems such that it seems to him "as though wise and provident
                            Nature, by the dictates of right reason, excited by the moving
                            suggestions of humanity; and awed with the just demands of natural
                            liberty, equity, equality, and principles of self-preservation,
                            originally drew up the scheme." <ref id="ref_0428" rend="super"

                        <p>Wise enters into a consideration of the natural and the civil state. He
                            wishes "to disclose several principles of natural knowledge; plainly
                            discovering the Law of Nature; or the true sentiments of Natural Reason,
                            with respect to man's being and government." <ref id="ref_0429"

                            chief authority. Wise believes that man is in the natural state a
                            free-born creature, owing homage to no one save God. Man is governed by
                            the Law of Nature, which is the immutable standard God has stamped upon
                            the nature of man to guide him in all</p>

                        <p>his actions. It is the law of both justice and morality. Morals are the
                            "dictate of right reason founded in the soul of man." With Grotius and
                            Pufendorf he ascribes to man a sociable disposition. Man is guided by
                            selflove and the instinct of self-preservation, but has a love for his
                            fellows. Interference with the natural liberty of man is a violation of
                            the Law of Nature. "Every man must be regarded as equal to every other
                            man, since all subjection and all command are equally banished on both
                            sides." <ref id="ref_0430" rend="super" target="note_0430">1</ref> He
                            holds that all men are born free by natural right. Civil government is
                            not of divine institution, but is formed by a voluntary compact. If
                            formed by nature, governments would be everywhere alike. That government
                            is best which agrees with the temper and inclinations of a people. There
                            are several covenants necessary to form political society. The first is
                            a covenant to form society. Then a particular form of government must be
                            set up. Lastly, there must be a covenant between rulers and subjects,
                            the former promising to care for the common peace and welfare, the
                            latter to yield faithful obedience. The State is a compound moral person
                            whose will is the will of all. The common welfare or happiness of the
                            people is the chief end of the State. Sovereignty is either original or
                            delegated. Originally all power is in the people.<ref id="ref_0431"
                                rend="super" target="note_0431">2</ref> The people may establish any

                        <p>Such are the political doctrines of this remarkable treatise which was
                            used by the colonists as a kind of political text-book. It is a proof of
                            the democratic sentiments generated by the theory of Natural Law. It
                            shows likewise that these liberal doctrines were particularly congenial
                            to Congregationalists. Not only to them, but to the colonists in
                            general, did the theories of Natural Law possess great fascination,
                            because their conditions seemed to support the truth of them. The
                            contract theory appeared to fit the circumstances exactly. A number of
                            persons set out to found a colony. They seem to be in a state of nature,
                            under no government whatever, until they assemble, draw up a compact,
                            and organize a government. At first a pure democracy prevails, all
                            having a hand in governing. Representation becomes necessary as the
                            colony increases in size. The colonists chose certain of their number to
                            act for the whole body. Sovereignty is, as it were, conferred by the
                            people upon the magistrates. If any one wishes to withdraw from the
                            jurisdiction of the State, he needs but to cross the borders of the
                            colony and strike out into the forests to find himself in the state of
                            nature.</p>

                        <p>To take Plymouth as an example. Here the entire body of the freemen who
                            were church-members at first exercised legislative power. A democratic
                            theocracy existed. There was no delegation of power. The number</p>

                        <p>of colonists having increased, the participation of all in regulating
                            public affairs became impracticable. Representation was accordingly
                            established in 1639. The deputies of the people and all officers of the
                            colony were chosen annually.<ref id="ref_0434" rend="super"
                                target="note_0434">1</ref> Providence also was originally a pure
                            democracy. The settlers met monthly in town meetings. Here, as in
                            Massachusetts, representation was established.<ref id="ref_0435"

                        <p>As we have seen, many factors worked together to generate a democratic
                            spirit in the colonists. They were really republicans before they
                            declared themselves to be so. To them the principle that all power is
                            derived from the people was more than a mere theory. Because the
                            political principles of the American Revolution had been embodied in
                            their institutions their influence was intensified. The ideas of Milton,
                            Sidney, Hooker, and Locke were familiar to them as Englishmen; but they
                            had among themselves since the beginning of their history ardent
                            champions of democratic views, viz.: Hooker, Roger Williams, Penn, and
                            others.</p>

                        <p>In the American colonies the conditions existed which engendered
                            democratic views and enabled the liberal political doctrines of the time
                            to bear fruit. The Puritan principles of government, as we find them
                            expressed in the works of Milton, Sidney, Locke, and others, of little
                            actual influence upon the constitution of the mother country, were
                            destined here to give birth to a form of government which is the
                            admiration and hope of the world. Nowhere did there exist a people so
                            devoted to their liberty, so independent in spirit, so</p>

                        <p>free from the bondage of custom and tradition, as these American
                            colonists. To no other people did the notion that all men are created
                            free and equal seem so true as to them, and nowhere else did freedom and
                            equality exist to the same extent. Inhabiting a new land, separated from
                            the motherland by a wide and treacherous ocean, with new problems
                            pressing for solution which could not be settled by precedent, what was
                            more natural than that they should break away from traditions and apply
                            reason to their affairs? The Law of Nature, being the Law of Reason,
                            must have attracted them greatly. In struggling for liberty of
                            conscience they had grown accustomed to look beyond the positive laws of
                            the State and appeal to what they believed to be their Natural
                                Right.<ref id="ref_0436" rend="super" target="note_0436">1</ref></p>

                        <p>The character of the colonists, their surroundings and form of life,
                            their free political institutions, their democratic form of church
                            government, as well as their past history, bred in them a spirit of
                            individualism. The theory of the sovereignty of the people lay at the
                            basis of their institutions--the doctrine which, as a ray of white light
                            contains the various prismatic colors, embraces in itself all the
                            so-called Rights of Man. Before individual rights could become secure,
                            the last traces of feudalism had to be destroyed and the doctrine of the
                            divine right of kings supplanted by the conception that the sovereignty
                            resides in the people.</p>

                        <p>It must not be forgotten that many of the colonists were men of excellent

                            upon the establishment of good schools. The sons of well-to-do families
                            not infrequently went abroad to finish their education. The desire for
                            culture was general. There was a large demand for books. Next to
                            religious books, treatises on legal and political subjects were most
                            eagerly read. To quote the words of Edmund Burke: " In no country,
                            perhaps, in the world is the law so general a study. The profession
                            itself is numerous and powerful, and in most provinces it takes the
                            lead. The greater number of deputies sent to the Congress were lawyers.
                            But all who read, and most do read, endeavor to obtain some smattering
                            in that science. I have been told by an eminent bookseller, that in no
                            branch of his business, after tracts of popular devotion, were so many
                            books as those on the law exported to the plantations. The colonists
                            have now fallen into the way of printing them for their own use. I hear
                            that they have sold nearly as many of Blackstone's 'Commentaries' in
                            America as in England." <ref id="ref_0437" rend="super"
                                target="note_0437">1</ref> It was especially works on Natural Law
                            which were carefully studied, the favorite writers being Grotius,
                            Pufendorf, Locke, Vattel, and others. The fruits of this study showed
                            themselves in the wonderful skill with which the colonists stated and
                            defended their rights during the struggle with the motherland. With this
                            conflict, and especially the documents to which it gave birth, we must
                            now concern ourselves.</p>

                            colonists at first appealed to the common law of England and their
                            rights as English subjects. They would not be treated as
                            subject-colonies and dependencies, but claimed the same rights and
                            immunities their brethren in England enjoyed. These rights and liberties
                            they declared to be their birthright as Englishmen. Not finding their
                            grievances redressed they sought for another standard to which to
                            appeal. Being denied their rights as English subjects they appealed to
                            their rights as men. What they could not obtain by the laws of the land
                            they now demanded according to Natural Right and the Law of Nature.</p>

                        <p>Massachusetts began the Revolution. She, also, first of all the colonies,
                            appealed to Natural Right. Three persons, James Otis, John Adams, and
                            Samuel Adams were instrumental in bringing this about. The writers on
                            Natural Law which they quote are Hooker, Locke, Harrington, Grotius,
                            Pufendorf, Vattel, and Burlamaqui. Of James Otis, John Adams writes:

                        <p>In his celebrated speech on the writs of assistance, delivered at Boston,
                            February, 1761, Otis spoke of the Rights of Man in the state of nature,
                            asserting that in the natural state every man was his own independent
                            sovereign, subject to, and guided by, the law written in his heart, and
                            revealed to him by God through reason and conscience. He declared that
                            man had an inherent and inalienable right to his life, liberty, and
                            property. The reason why men associated to form a government he declared
                            to be mutual defence and security of life, liberty, and property. For
                            this end alone had the people given up their primitive rights. These
                            principles he held to be fundamental laws of the British constitution.
                            He declared all men to be free and equal, including even the negroes.
                            John Adams relates that he shuddered to hear doctrines whose import was

                            it, its opponents might after all not be able to prove "that the
                            doctrine is a piece of metaphysical jargon and systematical nonsense."
                            For a fuller consideration of the subject he refers to Locke, Vattel,
                            and the "divine" writings of the "great and incomparable" Harrington. Of
                            the supreme power, Otis says that it is originally and ultimately in the
                            people, and that they never did in fact freely, nor can they rightfully,
                            make an absolute unlimited renunciation of this divine right, which is
                            ever in the nature of the thing given in trust and on a condition, the
                            performance of which no mortal can dispense with, viz.: that the person
                            on whom the sovereignty is conferred by the people shall incessantly
                            consult their good. He says that the principle of the <hi rend="i">salus
                                populi</hi> is part of the law of nature and of that grand charter
                            which God, to whom alone belongs the right to absolute power, has given
                            to the human race. The object of government he considers to be to
                            provide for the security and the quiet and happy enjoyment of life,
                            liberty, and property.<ref id="ref_0440" rend="super" target="note_0440"

                        <p>The people may choose any form of government they please. Every

                        <p>of Nature and of Reason. No king has absolute power. Nothing but life and
                            liberty are naturally hereditary. Otis believed with Locke that the
                            Legislature has supreme power, but that this power is only fiduciary,
                            and that the people may remove or change the legislature when it
                            disregards the will of the people, who in that case have a right to
                            assume their original liberty.<ref id="ref_0443" rend="super"
                                target="note_0443">1</ref> Otis next treats of colonies in general.
                            He considers the colonists to "be entitled to as ample rights,
                            liberties, and privileges as the subjects of the mother country are, and
                            in some respects to more." <ref id="ref_0444" rend="super"
                                target="note_0444">2</ref></p>

                        <p>Then follows a consideration of the Natural Rights of the colonists. By
                            the Law of Nature they are born free, as all men are, without
                            distinction of color. Here again Locke is quoted as asserting that all
                            men are equal because they are all of the same species and rank,
                            possessed of the same faculties and entitled to the same advantage of
                            nature. The colonists being men, are equally entitled to all the Rights
                            of Nature with Europeans. The Law of Nature was made by God. Man has no
                            power to mend it or alter its course. He can only obey or disobey
                            it.</p>

                        <p>Should the charter privileges of the colonists be disregarded or revoked,
                            there are natural, inherent, and inseparable rights as men and as
                            citizens that would remain after the so-much-wished-for catastrophe, and
                            which, whatever became of charters, can never be abolished <hi rend="i"

                            relative, declaring the natural, absolute, personal rights of the

                            political and civil liberty.</p>

                        <p>The absolute liberties of Englishmen he declared to be: 1. The right of
                            personal security; 2. Personal liberty; and 3. Private property.</p>

                        <p>The secondary rights which he meant to preserve from attack are: 1. The
                            constitution or power of Parliament. 2. The limitation of royal power.
                            3. The regular administration of justice. 4. The right of petition. 5.
                            The right of having and using arms for self-defence.</p>

                        <p>In the <hi rend="i">Considerations on Behalf of the Colonists in a Letter
                                to a Noble Lord,</hi> Otis praises the works of Selden, Locke, and
                            Sidney, and censures the views of Hobbes.</p>

                        <p>He says that when the members of a society united from a state of nature
                            and assembled in order to regulate their affairs, they were all equal
                            and on the same level. The minority must obey the decisions of the
                            majority. If their number be too large, they may delegate the governing
                            power to whom they please. The persons chosen to act for the whole, are
                            the trustees or agents of the entire society, and have a right to act
                            for it so long as chosen. Every branch of government derives its power
                            originally from the whole community. Jus divinum, the indefeasible
                            inheritance, the indelible character, are only for the entertainment of
                            old women. We have here the ideas of the Declaration of Independence and
                            of the American Bills of Rights.</p>

                            restrained by human laws--rights, derived from the great Legislator of

                        <p>The people have an "indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine
                            right" to know how their government is being conducted. Rulers are the
                            attorneys, agents, and trustees of the people. If they violate the trust
                            reposed in them, the people have a right to revoke the authority that
                            they themselves have deputed "and to constitute abler and better agents,
                            attorneys, and trustees." " British liberties are not the grants of
                            princes or parliaments, but original rights, conditions of original
                            contracts, coequal with prerogative and coeval with government." "Many
                            of our rights are inherent and essential, agreed on as maxims, and
                            established as preliminaries even before a Parliament existed." <ref

                        <p>Human nature is the foundation of government. Truth, liberty, justice,

                            to the Law of Nature. This was without doubt due to the influence of
                            Otis, John and Samuel Adams, all three of whom were men of great
                            preeminence and influence, and actively engaged in the events that
                            brought on the Revolution. Already in his youth Samuel Adams possessed
                            those republican opinions for which he contended in manhood. In 1749,
                            while but twenty-six years of age, he contributed an essay on Liberty to

                                target="note_0449">2</ref> He drafted the famous fourteen resolves
                            which were passed by the House October 29, 1765, as the assertion of the
                            inherent and inalienable rights of the people. These resolutions created
                            a sensation throughout the country and were universally applauded by the
                            friends of liberty. They speak of the essential rights of the British
                            constitution, which are founded in the law of God and Nature, and are
                            common Rights of Mankind, to which the colonists are entitled, and of
                            which they cannot be deprived. Security of property and voting of taxes

                            without the consent of the General Assembly of the same, is an invasion

                            as a protest against the infringement of the rights of the colonists by

                        <p>of Nature, the duty of self-preservation. No man can be compelled to
                            leave the state of nature, nor prevented, in case of civil or religious
                            oppression, from entering another society. Men enter society by their
                            own voluntary consent. The compact they form must be observed in every
                            particular. They reserve to themselves every right not expressly ceded.
                            The Law of Natural Reason is the standard to which all positive laws
                            should conform. Every man has a right to worship God as his conscience
                            dictates. To just and true liberty, equal and impartial liberty, all men
                            have a right according to the eternal and immutable laws of God and
                            Nature. The natural liberty of man is absolutew except that of Nature.
                            In the state of Nature every man is his own judge, subject only to God.
                            When man enters society this natural liberty is not abridged any further
                            than is necessary for the good of the whole. It is absurd to suppose
                            that men would renounce their essential Natural Rights or the power to
                            protect or preserve them. It is for the very protection of their rights
                            that government is instituted. Being given to man by God, the right to
                            freedom cannot be yielded up to another. Man cannot enslave himself.
                            Should he through fear, fraud, or mistake relinquish any one of his
                            essential rights, the renunciation would be void according to the
                            eternal law of reason and the grand end of society.</p>

                        <p>The colonists are, by the laws of God and nature, and by the common law
                            of England, exclusive of all charters, declared to be entitled to all
                            the natural, essential, inherent, and inseparable rights, liberties, and
                            privileges of natural-born Englishmen. Among the rights which no man can
                            either relinquish or take away</p>

                            itself cannot subvert the fundamental natural law of the preservation of
                            society. 2. The power of the legislative is not an absolute or arbitrary
                            disposal over the lives and fortunes of the people and must be just and
                            equal for all. 3. No man can be justly deprived of his property without
                            his own consent or that of his representative.<ref id="ref_0454"

                            are the principles of the Revolution. All the documents of that period

                            adopted by a town, but established as the guide of a people in its march

                            fifty years his pen, his tongue, his activity, were constantly exerted

                        <p>At the close of the year 1774 the Council and House of Representatives of

                            was sent to all the town meetings and to all the ministers in the
                            colony. Among the principles which it contained the following are
                            noteworthy: "As the happiness of the people is the sole end of
                            government, so the consent of the people is the only foundation of it,
                            in reason, morality, and the natural fitness of things. And, therefore,
                            every act of government, every exercise of sovereignty against or

                        <p>is injustice, usurpation, and tyranny. It is a maxim that in every
                            government there must exist somewhere a supreme, sovereign, absolute,
                            and uncontrollable power; but this power resides always in the body of
                            the people; and it never was, or can be, delegated to one man or a few;
                            the great Creator having never given to men a right to vest others with
                            authority over them unlimited either in duration or degree."</p>

                            the people, they are no longer to be deemed magistrates vested with a
                            sacred character, but become public enemies and ought to be resisted."

                            custom it had become at the outbreak of the Revolution to employ the
                            doctrines of Natural Law in defending the rights of the colonists. Thus,
                            the young Alexander Hamilton, when still a student at college, evinced
                            not only his learning in the positive laws of England, but also his
                            familiarity with the chief writers of Natural Law, in his vigorous and
                            able pamphlet, <hi rend="i">The Farmer Refuted,</hi> which appeared
                            February 5, 1775. He believes that the Deity is the author of an eternal
                            and immutable law which takes precedence over all human regulations and
                            binds mankind prior to any human institution. The Natural Rights of
                            Mankind depend upon this law. Civil liberty</p>

                            civil society makes necessary. "The sacred rights of mankind are not to
                            be rummaged for among old parchments or musty records. They are written,
                            as with a sunbeam, in the whole volume of human nature, by the hand of
                            the Divinity itself, and can never be erased or obscured by mortal
                            power." <ref id="ref_0458" rend="super" target="note_0458">1</ref>
                            Hamilton holds that "in a state of nature no man had any moral power to

                            govern is the consent of the governed. "To usurp dominion over a people

                            are willing to entrust, is to violate that law of nature which gives
                            every man a right to his personal liberty, and can therefore confer no
                            obligation to obedience." <ref id="ref_0460" rend="super"

                        <p>Of the members of the Congress of 1774 Lord Chatham said in the English
                            Parliament that for genuine sagacity, for singular moderation, for solid
                            wisdom, manly spirit, sublime sentiments, and simplicity of language,
                            for everything respectable and honorable, the Congress of Philadelphia
                            stood unrivalled.<ref id="ref_0462" rend="super" target="note_0462"

                        <p>One of the first acts of this Congress was to appoint a committee
                            consisting of two delegates from each colony, to draw up a Declaration
                            of Rights and to point out the violations of these rights which had
                            taken place.<ref id="ref_0463" rend="super" target="note_0463"

                        <p>John Jay, James Duane, Richard Henry Lee, John Rutledge, John Adams, and
                            Samuel Adams were the leading members of this committee. It is
                            unfortunate that our knowledge of the discussions which arose concerning
                            these rights is so meager, our only source of information being the
                            sparse notes of John Adams. Evidently a dispute arose regarding the
                            basis of these rights. From what we know in regard to the views of John
                            and Samuel Adams, as expressed in their writings, it is probable that
                            they advocated an appeal to the Laws of Nature, such as had been made by
                            Massachusetts. The biographer of John Adams says that he advocated
                            "tracing effects to their ultimate causes. Quite averse to resting the
                            justice of the American claims upon the mere offspring of man's will,
                            upon the construction put upon an unwritten local law, or upon grants
                            and charters derived from an equivocal sovereignty, he preferred to
                            include an appeal to the general ideas of Natural Right."<ref

                        <p>rights." Colonel Lee advocated that the colonists lay their rights upon
                            the broadest bottom, the ground of Nature, since their ancestors found
                            no government here. But Mr. Rutledge thought their claims were founded
                            on the British constitution and not on the Law of Nature. Mr. Duane
                            thought the Laws of Nature would be too feeble a support.<ref

                            ordered to be prepared, the matter was referred to Congress itself. It
                            was decided, contrary to the views of Adams and others, that no mention
                            be made of Natural Rights and that no grievances be stated whose origin
                            went before 1763.<ref id="ref_0466" rend="super" target="note_0466"

                        <p>Through the thorough discussion of the principles of Natural Law and of
                            the Rights of Men the various delegates to Congress must all have become
                            familiar with these theories. This discussion may, after the connections
                            with the mother country had been completely severed, and there was no
                            longer an excuse to appeal to the British constitution, have led to the
                            "Bill of Rights" drawn up by Virginia, some of whose delegates had
                            opposed the appeal to Natural Rights in 1774, and may also explain in
                            some measure why the other colonies imitated the example of Virginia by
                            prefixing such declarations to their constitutions. The rights to which
                            the colonists are entitled, according to the declaration of Congress as
                            agreed upon October 14, 1774, "by the immutable Laws of Nature, the
                            principles of the English constitution, and the several charters or
                            compacts," are: The right to life, liberty, and property; the rights,
                            liberties, and immunities of free and natural-born subjects of England
                            which were possessed by their ancestors before they emigrated and which

                            taxation and internal policy. They are entitled to the common law of
                            England, especially to the right of trial by jury; to the English
                            Statutes which existed at the time of their colonization; to the
                            privileges and immunities granted by their charters and provincial laws;

                            the consent of the legislature is unlawful. The constituent branches of
                            government should be independent of each other. It is declared
                            unconstitutional, dangerous, and destructive to American legislation
                            that a council appointed at the pleasure of the crown exercise the
                            legislative power.<ref id="ref_0467" rend="super" target="note_0467"

                        <p>The basis of all these rights is still the British constitution. After
                            independence had been declared another basis was necessary. "Virginia,"
                            as Bancroft says, "moved from charters and customs to primal principles;
                            from the altercation about facts to the contemplation of immutable
                            truth. She summoned the eternal laws of man's being to protest against
                            all tyranny. The English petition of rights in 1688 was historic and
                            retrospective; the Virginia declaration came out of the heart of nature
                            and announced governing principles for all peoples in all time. It was
                            the voice of reason going forth to speak a new political world into
                            being. At the bar of humanity Virginia gave the name and fame of her
                            sons as hostages that her public life should show a likeness to the
                            highest ideas of right and equal freedom among men." <ref id="ref_0468"

                            instruction given by the county of Buckingham to its delegates is
                            indicative of the spirit and the purpose of this body. "We intrust you
                            to cause a total and final separation from Great Britain, to take place
                            as soon as possible; and a constitution to be established with a full
                            representation, and full and frequent elections, the most free, happy,
                            and permanent government that human wisdom can contrive and the
                            perfection of man maintain."</p>

                        <p>We have here indicated the spirit from which grew the Bill of Rights. It
                            was to be the work of this body to separate from the mother country, and
                            to create an entirely new government based upon the sovereignty of the
                            people and realizing the highest degree of perfection human wisdom could
                            devise. Reason, not custom, must be their guide; the Law of Nature, not
                            that of England, their standard.</p>

                        <p>A committee of thirty-two was appointed to draw up a Declaration of
                            Rights. Archibald Cary, Richard Bland, Edmund Randolph, Patrick Henry,
                            and James Madison were among its members.</p>

                        <p>It was George Mason who drew up the famous document known as the Virginia
                            Bill of Rights. The ideas contained therein were by no means new, but in
                            this paper they received a classic expression. They were presented to
                            the Convention on the 27th of May, 1776, by Archibald Cary. For two
                            weeks that body deliberated upon them. They were finally adopted without
                            alteration except as regards the last article, which refers to freedom
                            of conscience.</p>

                        <p>Mason's article favored granting full toleration of worship. James
                            Madison objected to the word toleration, declaring it to imply a
                            concession, while it was a</p>

                        <p>sacred Right of Man to worship God according to his conscience.<ref

                        <p>As Virginia was at the time the most aristocratic colony, so it was the
                            one in which the principle of religious toleration had received least
                            recognition. The Anglican Church was the established Church. Young
                            Madison had himself suffered from religious persecution. In a letter to
                            William Bradford, written January 24, 1774, he writes: "If the Church of
                            England had been the established and general religion in all the
                            northern colonies as it has been among us here, and uninterrupted
                            tranquillity had prevailed throughout the continent, it is clear to me
                            that slavery and subjection might and would have been gradually
                            insinuated among us. Union of religious sentiments begets a surprising
                            confidence, and ecclesiastical establishments tend to great ignorance
                            and corruption, all of which facilitate the execution of mischievous
                            projects." <ref id="ref_0470" rend="super" target="note_0470">2</ref>
                            "That diabolical, hell-conceived principle of persecution," he
                            continues, "rages among some; and to their eternal infamy, the clergy
                            can furnish their quota of imps for such a business. This vexes me the
                            worst of anything whatever. There are at this time, in the adjacent
                            country, not less than five or six well-meaning men in close jail for
                            publishing their religious sentiments, which, in the main, are very
                            orthodox. . . . So I must beg you to pity me and pray for liberty of
                            conscience to all." <ref id="ref_0471" rend="super" target="note_0471"
                                >3</ref> In another letter of April 1, 1774, he wrote: "Religious
                            bondage shackles and debilitates the mind, and unfits it for every noble

                        <p>declares "that all men are by nature equally free and independent." The
                            compact theory of government is presupposed. Men are conceived as having
                            inherent rights of which they cannot deprive or divest their
                            descendants. These natural or inherent rights are designated as "the
                            enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and
                            possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and
                                safety."<ref id="ref_0473" rend="super" target="note_0473">1</ref>
                            The doctrine of the sovereignty of the people is clearly expressed. All
                            power is asserted to be vested in, and derived from, them. "Magistrates
                            are their trustees and servants, and at all times amenable to them."</p>

                        <p>The object of government is defined as the "common benefit, protection,
                            and security of the people." Of possible forms of government, that is
                            best which ensures the greatest degree of happiness and safety and the
                            best administration. The people may change the government if these
                            purposes are not realized. This is said to be "an indubitable,
                            inalienable, and indefeasible right."</p>

                        <p>Public service alone is declared to be the title to exclusive emolument
                            or privilege. No offices ought to be hereditary.</p>

                        <p>The doctrine of separation of powers which had been developed by Hooker,
                            Milton, and Montesquieu is stated. There are to be frequent, certain,
                            and regular elections. There ought to be no caste of public officials.
                            All officers of the State are to be taken from the body of the people
                            and shall return to private station. Elections ought to be free. The
                            right of suffrage should be given to all who have common interest with
                            and attachment to the community. No one ought to be taxed without his
                            consent or deprived of his property</p>

                        <p>involuntarily. All laws are to issue from the people or their
                            representatives, and to have for their object the public good.</p>

                        <p>The suspension of laws or their execution by an unlawful authority is
                            affirmed to be contrary to the rights of the people. Then follow four
                            clauses which are judicial in their nature, to the effect that every man
                            has a right to demand the cause of his accusation in all capital or
                            criminal prosecutions; to be confronted with accusers and witnesses; to
                            call for evidence in his favor; to be tried by an impartial jury of
                            twelve men; that he cannot be compelled to give evidence against
                            himself, nor can be deprived of his liberty except by the law of the
                            land or the judgment of his peers.<ref id="ref_0474" rend="super"
                                target="note_0474">1</ref> "Excessive bail ought not to be required,

                            General warrants ought not be granted. The trial by jury in cases
                            affecting property should be held sacred.</p>

                        <p>The freedom of the press is declared to be one of the great bulwarks of
                            liberty which no free government will restrain.</p>

                        <p>The proper, natural, and safe defence of a free. State is considered to
                            be a well-regulated militia of the citizens. Standing armies are
                            dangerous to liberty. The civil power should control the military.</p>

                        <p>Government should be uniform. It is only by adhering to justice,
                            moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue, and by keeping
                            fundamental principles in mind, that liberty can be preserved.</p>

                        <p>Madison's article closes the list. It affirmed "that religion, or the
                            duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can

                        <p> The Declaration of Independence, composed after the Virginia Bill of
                            Rights, declares that the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle one
                            people to sever their connection with another and make themselves
                            independent. It holds certain things to be self-evident truths, that is,
                            to be true according to the Law of Nature. One of these truths is that
                            all men are created equal. Wherein this equality consists we are not
                            told. It is also asserted that men possess certain unalienable rights,
                            among which are the right to life, to liberty, and to the pursuit of
                            happiness. Governments are held to be instituted for the purpose of
                            securing these rights. The principle of the sovereignty of the people is
                            also asserted. The people may change or abolish a government that
                            becomes destructive to the ends for which it is instituted. They may
                            "institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and
                            organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to
                            effect their safety and happiness."</p>

                        <p>There is not a single principle among these of which Jefferson was the
                            originator. Some of these doctrines had been put forth centuries before.
                            There can be no doubt, however, that the influence of the Declaration of
                            Independence was greater than that of any other similar document.</p>

                        <p>The example of Virginia was followed by the other American States. The
                            Virginia Bill became the model for other Bills of Rights which the
                            various States prefixed to their constitutions to guarantee the rights
                            of the citizens.</p>

                            politic to be formed by a voluntary association of individuals and to be
                            "a social compact, by which the whole people covenants with each
                            citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be
                            governed by certain laws for the common good." The constitution declares
                            all men to be born free and equal. It empowers the people to provide for
                            the institution of the public worship of God and "the support and
                            maintenance of public Protestant teachers of piety, religion, and

                        <p>The Pennsylvania constitution of 1776 contains the statement "that all
                            men have a natural inherent right to emigrate from one State to another
                            that will receive them, or to form a new State in vacant countries, or
                            in such countries as they can purchase, whenever they think that thereby
                            they may promote their own happiness." Another article says "that the
                            people have a right to assemble together, to consult for their common
                            good, to instruct their representatives, and to apply to the legislature
                            for redress of grievances, by address, petition, or remonstrance." <ref

                        <p>The importance attached by Americans to these Bills of Rights is shown by
                            the fact that all the States have incorporated some such a Declaration
                            of Rights into their constitutions, the newer States having in most

                            the English declarations contain no allusions to Natural Justice nor any
                            abstract principles whatever, but name certain concrete rights to which
                            individuals are entitled, not as men, but as English subjects. In the

                        <p>of Rights, on the other hand, we find statements of abstract principles;
                            such as the natural freedom and equality of men, the purpose of
                            government, the doctrines of the sovereignty of the people, of the
                            separation of powers, and the like, associated with statements of
                            concrete rights; such as the right of trial by jury, freedom of speech
                            and of the press, freedom of elections, security against excessive
                            fines, cruel and unusual punishments, general warrants, and others.
                            While the first class of statements are based upon the doctrines of
                            Locke, Blackstone, Vattel, Pufendorf, and in a few instances of
                            Montesquieu and Rousseau, the concrete rights are taken in most cases,
                            and often copied verbatim, from Magna Charta or the English Bill of
                            Rights.</p>

                        <p> In severing the ties which bound them to the motherland, the colonists
                            could no longer regard rights which were granted by king and Parliament
                            as applying to them. They must find another support for their rights.
                            The political philosophy of their age came to their relief. They
                            proclaimed the Rights of Man and founded them in Nature. But it was only
                            natural that the well-known clauses of the English documents should
                            still possess attraction for them. Indeed, it was for definite rights
                            they cared most. Sober Englishmen as they were, there was but little
                            likelihood of their attempting to carry abstract statements of equality
                            and liberty to their logical conclusions, as did the French people
                            during their Revolution. In France these selfsame ideas became a mass of
                            dynamite which shattered the entire social and political order of things
                            and gave rise to the worst excesses of the Reign of Terror. In America
                            no disturbances of any sort arose as a result of the proclamation of
                            these principles. The difference of consequences is attributable to a
                            difference</p>

                        <pb id="VAB1855-216" n="202"/>

                        <p>of circumstances, of past history, and above all, a difference in the
                            character of the American and the French people. What has been called
                            the "Revolutionary spirit" was totally lacking in America. Again, while
                            the American Revolution had few further results than that of recognizing
                            the independence of the colonies, the French Revolution was a social,
                            political, and administrative upheaval, which meant the arrival of a new
                            era, not only for France, but for the world.</p>

                        <p>It must not be supposed, however, that these doctrines have had no
                            influence in America. On the contrary, it is impossible to overestimate
                            their influence in promoting that love of individual liberty which, it
                            is true, is characteristic of the entire Anglo-Saxon race, but which is
                            nowhere so strong as in this country. American enterprise and
                            independence of character cannot be matched the world over. It is this
                            trait of character which, more than any other, has made our country what
                            it is to-day. This American spirit is the spirit of the Bills of Rights.
                            The American States have proclaimed and guaranteed the rights of the
                            individual. Indeed, the Bill of Rights is everywhere, perhaps, regarded
                            as the most important part of the State constitution. Judges have
                            frequently declared laws unconstitutional because they were contrary to
                            the spirit of the Bill of Rights.</p>

                        <p>But what necessity is there for such declarations of rights in a
                            republic?</p>

                        <p>Magna Charta and the other English papers were intended primarily as a
                            protection of the individual against the arbitrary exercise of power on
                            the part of the king. They were to serve as a check upon the king. Since
                            to-day the king has become a mere figurehead, however, and Parliament
                            has become omnipotent, these</p>

                        <pb id="VAB1855-217" n="203"/>

                        <p>documents no longer have a purpose. They do not protect the individual
                            against Parliament, for the power of Parliament is unlimited. Parliament
                            possessing full sovereignty can grant or take away individual rights as
                            it chooses. There is therefore, in the British constitution, no means of
                            protecting the individual against the government.</p>

                        <p>The American Bills of Rights are intended to serve as a check upon the
                            government, restraining it from interference with the rights the
                            individual is to enjoy. But is such a safeguard necessary in a
                            government where the power is in the hands of the people? To answer this
                            question it is necessary to bear in mind that democracy and liberty are
                            by no means synonymous. The fact that the people rule is no guarantee
                            that personal liberty must prevail. Public liberty does not imply civil
                            liberty. The inhabitants of the Greek and Roman republics possessed
                            extensive public rights, but no individual rights in the modern sense.
                            It is true that in the last few centuries the struggle for liberty has
                            been at the same time the struggle for democracy. But unlimited
                            sovereignty, whether exercised by one, a few, or the many, is always
                            liable to lead to tyranny. It is doubtful whether any tyranny can be
                            worse than that exercised in the name of the sovereignty of the people.
                            France experienced the truth of this during the Reign of Terror. The
                            Bills of Rights are intended as a limitation of the sovereignty of the
                            people in favor of the liberty of the individual.</p>

                            was watched by Europeans in general, and by the French in particular,
                            with intense interest.</p>

                        <p>One must consider the views of the French in the eighteenth century in
                            order to understand the sympathy they entertained for the Americans.</p>

                        <p>In the new world the ideas of Rousseau and of the other philosophers of
                            that century seemed to be realized. There reason, simplicity,
                            naturalness, and virtue were thought to reign.</p>

                        <p>The Count of Segur tells us in his memoirs how intense the excitement was
                            at Spa, a fashionable watering-place frequented by the aristocracy of
                            Europe, when the news of the events in Boston in 1775 became known. "The
                            first shot of the cannon fired in the new hemisphere," he writes,
                            "resounded throughout Europe with the rapidity of lightning. . . ." "The
                            courageous daring of the Americans electrified all spirits and excited

                            insurrection spread everywhere like a fashion . . . and I was far from
                            being the only one whose heart throbbed at the news of the awaking of

                            that he found the same agitation prevailing in Paris, and that the
                            envoys of the Americans, Deane, Lee, and Franklin, seemed to be the sage
                            contemporaries of Plato, or republicans of the time of Cato and

                        <p>Many members of the noblest families of France hastened to the scene of
                            conflict and fought with distinction at the side of Washington. Covered
                            with glory they returned to their native land, ardent advocates of the
                            American views of liberty and equality. These ideas spread widely, for

                            monarchical forms views had become republican, it was not difficult for

                            published a book entitled <hi rend="i">De la France et des
                                États-Unis,</hi> by Clavière and Brissot. It deals with the
                            prospects of commerce between France and America. In the introduction
                            Brissot says that the American Revolution had occasioned the discussion
                            of many points important for the public welfare, such as the social
                            contract, civil liberty, the things that can render a people
                            independent, and the circumstances which legitimatize an insurrection
                            and cause a nation to take a place among the powers of the world. "What
                            good," he writes, "have not done and will not do the codes of
                            Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New York, published and spread everywhere?

                            the governments of Europe will be forced to reform their abuses and

                        <p>The Abbé Raynal published in 1785 a series of letters he had written to

                        <p>" These constitutions have gone to the principles of nature. They have
                            established it as an axiom that all political authority derives its
                            origin from the people, and that magistrates are but the agents of the
                            people. The Americans know the Rights of Men and of Nations. The
                            delegates who have framed the constitutions have adopted the wise
                            principles of Locke regarding natural liberty and the nature of
                            government."</p>

                        <p>Raynal says he has thoroughly studied the legislation of America. "All
                            Europe," he declares, "having feared that the Americans would not be

                            courage and constancy they have shown, and with the happy success they

                            which it ought to protect, when it breaks the compact which assures

                            appeared in London in 1785. He regrets that this order was established
                            "at the end of the eighteenth century, at the moment when America seemed
                            to open an asylum to the human race; at the moment when the most
                            surprising revolution, the only one, perhaps, which philosophy approves
                            of, has turned the attention of all to the other hemisphere." <ref

                            Mirabeau says, "have made equality the basis of their insurrection,
                            their work, their demands, their rights, and their code. For this reason
                            they occupy among the powers of the world the rank and separate position
                            to which they are entitled by virtue of the Laws of Nature and of

                            of the various States. "All the States of the Confederation have
                            declared in their constitutions that men are born free and equal; that
                            they possess natural, essential, and unalienable rights, of which they
                            can by no compact deprive or despoil their posterity; that all
                            government derives its right from the people; that no authority can be
                            exercised over the people except that which emanates from them or is
                            accorded by them; that the various officers of the government clothed
                            with any legislative, executive, or judicial authority, are the
                            substitutes, the agents, the servants of the people, and accountable to
                            them at all times; that government is established for the common
                            welfare, for the protection and security of the people, and not for the
                            profit or interest of a single person, family, or assemblage of men who
                            are but a part of the community; that government shall ensure the

                        <p>"America," Mirabeau declared, "can, and is going to, determine with
                            certainty whether the human race is destined by nature to liberty or
                            slavery. No republican government has ever found in any part of the
                            globe such favorable circumstances." America is destined to show whether
                            or not the beautiful ideas of Sidney, Locke, and Rousseau are to remain
                            superb theories, whose realization is impracticable. Mirabeau appended
                            to his <hi rend="i">Considerations</hi> a letter written by the famous
                            Turgot to Dr. Price, an Englishman who possessed great enthusiasm for
                            America, and also Price's <hi rend="i">Observations on the Importance of
                                the American Revolution.</hi></p>

                        <p>In his letter Turgot wrote: "America is the hope of the human race and
                            ought to become the model for humanity. She ought to prove to the world

                            The asylum she opens to the oppressed ought to console the world. The
                            facility of profiting therefrom to escape the results of bad government,
                            will force all governments to be just and to enlighten themselves." <ref

                        <p>Price speaks of the American Revolution as opening a new era in the
                            history of the world and of presenting a grand perspective. He regards
                            it as having spread among the nations healthful principles concerning
                            the Rights of Mankind and the nature of government, and of having given
                            rise to a general spirit of resistance to tyranny. The Revolution, he
                            says, gave to America the most equitable and free government in
                            existence. He thinks that in America all the nations of the world will
                            be blest. This vast continent will become a refuge for the oppressed of
                            all nations. A republic has been established which will become the seat
                            of liberty, the sanctuary of science and of virtue. He hopes that
                            America will preserve this sacred treasure until all peoples enjoy it
                            and the infamous servitude which degrades the earth will have terminated
                            forever. Since the introduction of Christianity no epoch has been of
                            equal influence upon the advancement of the race as has been that of the
                            American Revolution. He believes that this revolution will diffuse among
                            all nations the principles of the Rights of Man, and will afford the
                            means of throwing off the yoke of superstition and tyranny.<ref

                                them.<ref id="ref_0494" rend="super" target="note_0494">1</ref> He
                            says that "The first Declaration of Rights which really merits the name,
                            is that of Virginia, issued June 1, 1776; and the author of this
                            production has claims to the everlasting gratitude of the human race.
                            Six other American States have imitated the example of Virginia." <ref
                                id="ref_0495" rend="super" target="note_0495">2</ref> These
                            declarations do not entirely satisfy him and he indicates several
                            omissions. Nevertheless there is no doubt in his mind that such a
                            declaration, which contains a clear statement of the Rights of Man, is
                            the only means of preventing tyranny, and will be a work useful to
                            mankind as a safeguard of public tranquillity and liberty. According to
                            his view, the best method of obtaining such a declaration is to
                            encourage enlightened men to draw up models and then to have these
                            drafts published, a course which was afterward pursued by the
                            Constituent Assembly. Condorcet himself composed a lengthy Declaration
                            of Rights in several sections, distinguishing between the Rights of Man
                            relative to personal safety, to personal liberty, to safety of property,
                            to liberty of property, and to natural equality. Condorcet took an
                            active part in the French Revolution. Eventually siding with the
                            Girondists, Condorcet presented to the convention the constitution, in
                            which was incorporated a Declaration of Rights, which had been drawn up
                            according to the principles of the Girondist party. He was likewise one
                            of the most energetic opponents against the attempts of the Mountain to
                            attack individual rights on the ground of promoting the public

                        <p>Mirabeau drew up a Declaration of Rights for the people of Holland in a
                            pamphlet which he wrote in 1788, at the suggestion of the Dutch
                            republicans, and which bears the title, <hi rend="i">Address to the
                                Batavians Concerning the Stadtholdership.</hi></p>

                        <p>He proposes to enumerate the rights to which this people are entitled as
                            men--rights which are inherent, prior to and above all written laws,
                            unalienable, and the eternal foundation of political society. He
                            considers these rights to be fully carried out only in the American
                            constitution. Without these rights mankind cannot maintain its dignity,
                            cannot perfect itself, or enjoy peace. Every nation desiring freedom
                            must be in possession of them.</p>

                        <p> Mirabeau's paper agrees with the American Bills of Rights in most of its
                            articles, and is interesting not only because it shows American
                            influence, but also because it forms, as it were, the political
                            confession of faith of this great statesman. The Declaration contains
                            such statements as that of the freedom and equality of all men; the
                            sovereignty of the people; universal toleration; freedom of the press,
                            of speech, of public meeting, and of elections; the separation of
                            powers; abolition of exclusive privileges; the subordination of the
                            military to the civil power; establishment of the militia system rather
                            than having standing armies; freedom from attack upon person, house,
                            papers, and property; independence of judges; right to speedy, free, and
                            unbiassed justice; freedom from banishment or deprivation of life,
                            liberty, or property, without a valid legal sentence.</p>

                        <p>We have seen that Mirabeau was well acquainted with the leading papers
                            issued by the American general government as well as by the individual
                            States. He</p>

                            the discussions regarding the Declaration of the Rights of Man, and was
                            one of the committee of five appointed by that body to prepare this
                            Declaration.</p>

                        <p>There can be no doubt that the American Revolution seemed to Europeans to
                            signify the dawn of liberty. This explains the interest they took in
                            American affairs. The Marquis of Chastellux, who travelled in America
                            during the years 1780-82, assured a number of farmers who were surprised
                            to see a map of their country in the hands of a Frenchman, that his
                            countrymen were as well acquainted with America as they were with their
                            next neighbors. In the preface to his Travels he says that the French
                            hailed with the greatest eagerness all information about America, and

                            intimate friends, though not intended for the public, passed rapidly
                            from hand to hand and were read with avidity.</p>

                        <p>Nor was this interest in American affairs confined to France. Of the
                            influence of our Revolution on the Germans a writer says: "The
                            republican sympathies of the educated and wide-awake classes in Germany
                            were increased and strengthened by the War of American Independence, and
                            especially by the surprisingly happy termination of that war. The long
                            extracts from the Congressional debates, the addresses of the rebellious
                            colonies, the Declaration of the Rights of Man by Congress, the orations
                            of the leaders in Congress and the army, were zealously spread by German
                            newspapers, and of necessity powerfully influenced the people. Yes, the
                            governments even, inasmuch as England was at the time greatly hated by
                            them, sided with the Americans and their principles, though the latter
                            contrasted</p>

                        <p>greatly with German conditions. Frederick the Great especially favored
                            the colonists. The victory of the young republic was hailed with general
                            and sympathetic rejoicing." <ref id="ref_0497" rend="super"
                                target="note_0497">1</ref> There was great indignation throughout
                            Germany at the shameless traffic with Hessian soldiers. As the French
                            officers returned to their native land filled with enthusiasm for
                            American institutions and principles, so these German soldiers
                            acquainted their countrymen with American ideas, not only by their
                            written accounts, but also, and more especially, by their glowing
                            accounts after their return.<ref id="ref_0498" rend="super"

                        <p>A German nobleman in the American service wrote to his friends in the old
                            world enthusiastic accounts of the "beautiful and happy land, without
                            kings, priests, farmers of taxes, and lazy barons, the land where every

                        <p>In 1783 there appeared in a Berlin journal an ode which contains these
                            words: "And thou, Europe, raise thy head. Soon will shine the day when
                            thy chains shall break. Thy princes expelled, thou wilt hail a happy
                            free state." Addressing America the poet says: "Thy example speaks
                            loudly to the farthest nations, free is he who wills it and is worthy to
                            be so. Yet ever-raging despotism, which, breaking God's laws, serves but
                            the great, frightens the nations." The writer blesses "the better
                            hemisphere, where sweet equality reigns, and Europe's curse, nobility,
                            does not simplicity's custom stain, wrongly defying worthier men,

                        <p>The years preceding the outbreak of the great French Revolution were a
                            time of great ferment in Europe, especially in France. The masses were
                            becoming enlightened. The revolutionary teachings of such writers as
                            Condillac, Holbach, Diderot, Voltaire, Rousseau, and others were
                            beginning to bear fruit. In America these principles had conquered.
                            Their success in that country increased their popularity and influence.
                            It was hoped that they would overthrow tyranny in the old world
                            likewise. The calling of the States General filled the French people
                            with hope that a new order of things would soon result. The instructions
                            prepared by the French districts for their representatives, which were
                            called Cahiers, give expression to the hopes and desires of the French
                            people on the eve of the Revolution. These papers show that the American
                            idea of enumerating individual rights in a declaration had met with
                            great favor. Several Cahiers suggest that a similar Declaration of the
                            Rights of Man should be drawn up by the States General.</p>

                        <p>The Cahier of the Third Estate of Paris contains a declaration which
                            states that all men have equal rights; that all power emanates from the
                            people and should be exercised only for their welfare; that the general
                            will makes the law and public power assures its execution. All subsidies
                            are declared to be conceded by the nation, which has the right to
                            determine their amount, to limit their duration, to designate the use to
                            which they shall be put, to demand an account of their employment, and
                            to insist upon their publication. The object of the law is to protect
                            property and ensure personal security. No citizen should be arrested or
                            punished without legal judgment, nor be arbitrarily deprived of any
                            office he may hold. Each citizen has the right to</p>

                        <pb id="VAB1855-233" n="219"/>

                        <p>be admitted to any office, possession, or dignity. The natural, civil,
                            and religious liberty of every man, his personal security, his absolute
                            independence of all authority except that of the law, excludes every
                            enquiry into his opinions, his speech, his writings, and his actions, so
                            long as they do not disturb the public order and injure the rights of
                            another. The declaration of natural, civil, and political rights was to
                            become the national charter, and the basis of the French government.</p>

                        <p>The Cahier instructed the deputies to demand a number of reforms as a
                            consequence of the principles of this Declaration of Rights; namely, the
                            abolition of all forms of servitude; of all unnecessary offices; of the
                            violation of public faith by searching letters sent through the mails;
                            and of all exclusive privileges, except a limited privilege to
                            inventors. Liberty of the press was likewise demanded, subject to
                            legitimate restrictions.</p>

                        <p>Perhaps the most remarkable of these Cahiers is that of the bailliage of
                            Nemours, among the deputies of which district was the Viscount de
                            Noailles, one of the young officers who had fought in America. This
                            paper affirms that the preservation of rights is the sole object of
                            political society, and holds that the knowledge of these rights ought to
                            be the basis of all laws and institutions. The States General ought to
                            determine these rights. A public Declaration should then be made by the
                            king, which is to be registered in all the courts, published several
                            times a year in all the churches, and inserted in all books intended for
                            the education of children. No person is to be entrusted with any charge,
                            place, or office, unless he has repeated this Declaration from<ref

                        <p>The electors of Nemours suggest certain truths which ought to be inserted
                            in this Declaration. Some of these ideas are quite fanciful. Every man
                            is said to have the right to do that which does not injure others. Every
                            man has a right to the assistance of others, and to a reciprocal service
                            from any one who has claimed his aid. Every helpless person has a right
                            to the gratuitous assistance of others. No man ought to be interrupted
                            or hindered in his work. No authority can compel any person to labor
                            without salary, or with insufficient salary. These maxims are very wise,
                            no doubt, but scarcely belong in a Declaration like the one intended.
                            Other demands are: Freedom of contract; inviolability of person and
                            property; no imprisonment without conviction; speedy trial; taxes to be
                            levied in proportion to income; no authority to supplant that of the
                            taxpayers or their representatives in levying taxes; freedom of speech,
                            of petition, and of the press. This is the gist of the thirty articles
                            this draft contains.</p>

                        <p>But already this draft seems to contain the germs of that spirit which
                            eventually destroyed individual liberty in France; namely, the desire
                            for a falsely conceived equality. Such appears to be the tendency of
                            statements like the one that every person is entitled to the assistance
                            of others; that every person in a state of infancy, helplessness, or
                            infirmity has a right to the gratuitous help of others; that any person
                            who has no income ought not be obliged to contribute to the payment of
                            the public expenses, but has a right to gratuitous aid.</p>

                        <p>It was, as we have seen, an injunction of several districts of France
                            upon the States General to enumerate and guarantee the Rights of Man and
                            of the Citizen after the American fashion. It was universally felt that
                            the</p>

                        <pb id="VAB1855-235" n="221"/>

                        <p>insecurity of the individual was one of the chief evils from which the
                            French were suffering, that <hi rend="i">lettres de cachet,</hi>
                            Bastille, seignorial rights, ought to be abolished.</p>

                        <p>The members of the States General, those representing the Third Estate at
                            least, were not likely to forget this behest.</p>

                        <p>It is true that in regard to the form of government the majority of the
                            members of the Constituent Assembly took England, rather than America,
                            as their model. Scarcely any one thought of the republic as a possible
                            or desirable form of government for France. Almost without exception the
                            monarchy was regarded as essential, even by such men as Lafayette. But
                            it was to become a constitutional monarchy.</p>

                        <p>But nevertheless the American idea of a Declaration of the Rights of Man
                            met with almost universal favor. It accorded perfectly with the tendency
                            of thought. Madame de Stail speaks of the democratic declarations which
                            found such applause in the Assembly, and states that this body was
                            seized by an enthusiasm for philosophy, of which the example of America
                            was a cause, the people of France believing that they might take as a
                            basis the principles which the people of the new world had adopted.<ref

                        <p>J<hi rend="sc">ULY</hi> 9, 1789, there was presented to the French
                            Constituent Assembly the report of the committee which that body had
                            selected to draft a constitution for France, regarding the plan
                            according to which the constitution should be framed. It was Mounier who
                            acted as reporter of the committee. He declared the sole end of
                            government to be the maintenance of the rights of man. In order to keep
                            this object constantly in view, there should be prefixed to the
                            constitution a Declaration of the Natural and Unalienable Rights of
                                Man.<ref id="ref_0504" rend="super" target="note_0504">1</ref></p>

                        <p>Three days later, Lafayette, of American fame, addressed the Assembly. As
                            commander of the National Guard he had no right to vote in that body,
                            but might participate in its deliberations. He now wished "to offer the
                            tribute of his thoughts." <ref id="ref_0505" rend="super"

                        <p>While in America Lafayette had imbibed the principles put forth during
                            the Revolution. On his return to France he enclosed a copy of the
                            American Declaration of Rights in a valuable frame. Beside the
                            Declaration there was an empty column headed: Declaration of the Rights

                        <p>Lafayette regarded the American Revolution as having inaugurated a new
                            social era. This new social order he held to be, properly speaking, the
                            period of the</p>

                                >1</ref> He said that only since the American Revolution had the
                            idea prevailed of defining the rights which nature gives to each man and
                            which are independent of all preexisting order, rights which are to such
                            an extent inherent in man's existence that not even the entire society
                            has the right to deprive him of them.2 He believed that the opportunity
                            had now come for France to imitate the example set by the Americans. In
                            his address to the Assembly, Lafayette affirmed the double purpose of a
                            Declaration of Rights as being: 1. To recall the sentiments which nature
                            had engraved on the heart of each individual, and to facilitate their
                            development, a task which is the more interesting because of the fact
                            that in order that a nation love liberty, it suffices that it know what
                            liberty is; and that in order to be free, it need only wish to be
                                so.<ref id="ref_0507" rend="super" target="note_0507">2</ref> To
                            express the eternal truths to which all institutions ought to conform
                            and which ought to be a guide to the representatives of the nation,
                            leading them to the source of Natural and Social Law. He said that a
                            Declaration of Rights should be true and precise, and should express
                            what the whole world knows and feels. As an attempt at such a
                            Declaration Lafayette presented a bill which contained the following
                            stipulations: 1. Nature has made men free and equal; distinctions
                            necessary for the social order aye founded on general utility alone. 2.
                            Every man is born with unalienable rights, such as liberty of opinion,
                            care of honor and of life, the right of property, the entire disposition
                            of his person, of his business, and of his faculties, the communication
                            of his thoughts in all ways possible, the pursuit of happiness, and
                            resistance to oppression. 3. The only limits to the exercise of Natural
                            Rights are</p>

                            consented to by himself or his representatives, and these laws must have
                            been previously promulgated and must be legally applied. 5. The origin
                            of all sovereignty is in the people. 6. No individual or corporation can
                            have any authority which does not expressly emanate from the people. 7.
                            All government has for its sole end the common welfare. This interest
                            demands that the legislative, executive, and judiciary powers be
                            distinct and defined, and that their organization assure the free
                            representation of the citizens, the responsibility of agents, and the
                            impartiality of judges. 8. The laws should be clear, precise, and
                            uniform. 9. The subsidies should be freely voted and proportionally
                            divided. 10. As the introduction of abuses and the rights of succeeding
                            generations necessitate the revision of all human establishments, it
                            ought to be possible for the nation to have, in ecrtain cases, an
                            extraordinary convocation of deputies, whose sole object be to examine
                            and correct, if necessary, the faults of the constitution.<ref

                        <p>It is evident that the project of Lafayette is modelled after the
                            Virginia Bill of Rights.<ref id="ref_0509" rend="super"

                            being wasted by foolish debates on the value and composition of a
                            perfect Declaration of Rights. There were long debates as to whether the
                            Declaration should precede the constitution, establishing the Rights of
                            Man previous to those of society, or be placed at the end, as a result
                            of the constitution. No agreement</p>

                            should contain such a Declaration. The question having been raised on
                            the 14th of July, but not then definitely decided, it was again raised
                            on the 1st of August. For several days a lively discussion was carried
                            on as to whether or not a Declaration of Rights should be drawn up, and
                            whether it should follow or precede the constitution.</p>

                        <p>On the 27th of July Champion de Cicé, Archbishop of Bordeaux, the
                            reporter for the committee of the constitution, said that the committee
                            had judged it necessary "that the constitution be preceded by a
                            Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen; not because it was
                            necessary to impress upon these first truths a force they already
                            derived from morals, from reason, and from nature, which had engrafted
                            them in all hearts, but because these ineffaceable principles should be
                            constantly before the eyes and in thought." This Declaration, he said,
                            "would be a constant guarantee against the fear of any disregard of its
                            principles." "If in the course of ages any power should attempt to
                            impose laws upon the people that were not an emanation from these
                            principles, this original and enduring type would instantly denounce
                            crime or error to all citizens." " This noble idea," he proceeded, "
                            conceived in another hemisphere, ought to be, because of its excellence,
                            at once transplanted among us. We have participated in the events that
                            gave to North America her liberty; she has shown us upon what principles
                            the conservation of our own should rest; and it is the new world,
                            whither we had formerly carried only weapons, which to-day teaches us to
                            secure ourselves against the misfortune of betaking thither our
                            persons." <ref id="ref_0510" rend="super" target="note_0510">1</ref></p>

                        <p>The Bishop of Auxerre, Champion de Cicé, thought the Declaration useless,
                            and said the example set by America was not conclusive, since that
                            country possessed only proprietors and cultivators of land, citizens who
                            were in fact equal. Before telling men they were free, as was done in
                            the United States, it is necessary that the laws be passed which placed
                            them on an equality.<ref id="ref_0511" rend="super" target="note_0511"

                        <p>Malouet expressed inquietude and regret on account of the time consumed
                            and the disorders that were accumulating. He thought that action rather
                            than talk was necessary. Though believing that the Rights of Man should
                            be held in view, and that they were not only the guide of the legislator
                            but also the object he should aim to realize, he thought these
                            principles ought to be presented as they are restricted by positive law.
                            If the Americans had not taken this precaution it was because they found
                            man in the natural state, and presented him to the universe in his
                            primitive sovereignty. The Americans were already accustomed to
                            equality. They were strangers to luxury as well as to indigence, free
                            from the yoke of imposts, of prejudice, and of feudal customs. But in
                            France a multitude of men were without property and dependent upon
                            assured labor and constant protection, irritated also by the spectacle
                            of luxury and opulence. The oppressed ought rather to be restored to
                            their rights. Wise institutions should bring together the happy and the
                            unhappy classes of society. Immoderate luxury should be attacked at its
                            source, for it assails all Natural Rights.<ref id="ref_0512"

                        <p>Malouet said that the domestic spirit which recalls man's Natural Rights,
                            and patriotism which consecrates them, should supplant the spirit of
                            caste and the love</p>

                            liberty and with the elevation of true patriotism. These reforms should
                            be effected, or at least attempted, before proclaiming to suffering men
                            who are destitute of enlightenment and of means, that they have equal
                            rights with the most powerful and most fortunate. He showed that each
                            natural law was modified by positive law, and that the moment a
                            particular form of government was chosen, the natural man and his rights
                            were restricted. He asked why a man should be taken to the top of a high
                            mountain and shown an unlimited empire that was said to belong to him,
                            when, on descending, he finds himself shut in at each step; why a man
                            should be told that he has the free disposition of his person, when he
                            must enter the army or the navy against his will; why he should be
                            assured that he may dispose of his property as he wishes, when custom
                            and law force him to dispose of it against his will; why it should be
                            said to him that if he is indigent he has a right to the assistance of
                            all, when he invokes in vain the pity of the passers-by. He said that
                            since every man whose rights were declared was a member of society,
                            there was therefore no reason of speaking of him as if he were separated
                            from society.</p>

                        <p>Malouet pointed out the danger that might result from interminable
                            metaphysical discussions, saying that under the circumstances of the
                            time, when the government was without force and means, when authority
                            was weakened and the courts inactive, when the people alone were in
                            motion, when there was no public income, but rather an increase of
                            expenditure, and all onerous obligations seemed unjust, a declaration
                            expressing in general and absolute terms natural liberty and equality,
                            might sever the bonds uniting the citizen and the government,</p>

                            of the deputies to establish principles, as Locke, Cumberland, Rousseau,
                            and others had done, but to promulgate their results; not to lay down
                            the preliminaries of the law, but to make the laws themselves. He said
                            that the time had arrived to create; that the law should be simple and
                            concise, so that even children could remember it. It was his opinion
                            that the framers of the constitution should reserve for themselves the
                            study of principles as bases of their labor, giving to the people only
                            the fruits of their work. In this case the vast foundation of the palace
                            would be hidden in the bosom of the earth, while to the eye of the
                            citizen only the majesty of the edifice would be visible. "Let us,"
                            concluded Delandine, "hasten to erect this edifice, and may it merit the
                            contemplation of the wise and the regard of posterity." <ref

                        <p>The Abbé Grégoire believed that a Declaration of Rights would be
                            incomplete without being at the same time a Declaration of Duties, since
                            rights and duties were correlative, and one could not exist without the
                            other. A man should be shown the circle within which he might move and
                            the barriers which ought to restrain him.<ref id="ref_0515" rend="super"

                        <p>The wise views of Malouet, Delandine, and Gregoire were not regarded. On
                            the 4th of August the excitement over the matter reached the climax.</p>

                        <p>An amendment proposed by Camus in accordance with the view of Grégoire
                            and many of the clergy, that there be also a Declaration of Duties, was
                            lost.</p>

                        <p>The Assembly decided almost unanimously that the Declaration be prefixed
                            to the constitution.</p>

                        <p>In the evening of the same day took place the celebrated abolition of
                            titles of nobility and feudal customs. The deliberation on the
                            Declaration of Rights was thereby suspended for several days, but it was
                            again resumed on the 14th of August.</p>

                        <p>A splendid opportunity offered itself to the members of the Constituent
                            Assembly to try their hands at framing a Declaration of Rights of Man,
                            and to demonstrate how well they were versed in political philosophy.
                            About fifty projects were presented to the Assembly. A committee of
                            five, consisting of Mirabeau, De La Luzerne, De Desmenniers, Tronchet,
                            and Rédon, was appointed to consider the various projects and to present
                            their conclusions to the Assembly. The three chief ones were those of
                            Lafayette, Sieyès, and Mounier. The first two had been written before
                            the convocation of the Constituent Assembly.<ref id="ref_0516"

                        <p>The Declaration framed by Mounier differed but slightly in its nature
                            from that of Lafayette. Some of its articles agreed almost <hi rend="i"
                                >verbatim</hi> with those of Lafayette's draft. But Mounier added
                            several additional clauses, to the effect that no <hi rend="i">ex post
                                facto</hi> laws should be passed; that all individuals be entitled
                            to the prompt succor of the law when their rights are infringed; that
                            they be secure from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment and from arbitrary
                            fines; that religious toleration and freedom of the press be guaranteed,
                            and that the civil authority alone have control over the military forces

                        <p>Mounier afterward regretted that he had participated in the Declaration
                            of the Rights of Man. Later events, especially those of the 5th and 6th
                            of October, showed him that abstract ideas on the Rights of Man might be
                            wrongly interpreted, and lead to dangerous consequences.<ref
                                id="ref_0518" rend="super" target="note_0518">2</ref></p>

                        <p>The Abbe Sieyes drew up a Declaration which was quite different in
                            character from any other. This expert constitution-maker, who considered
                            himself to have mastered the science of politics, presented a very
                            elaborate project in which each metaphysical principle followed its
                            predecessor in logical continuity. In order to facilitate the retention
                            of the eternal truths which this pamphlet professed to embody, and to
                            make them lucid for all classes, Sieyes likewise composed a short
                            extract of its main principles.<ref id="ref_0519" rend="super"
                                target="note_0519">3</ref></p>

                        <p>In his Declaration Sieyes considers society to have resulted from a
                            compact between all the associated, the purpose of this compact being
                            the greater good of all. Liberty is more extensive and secure in the
                            social, than in the natural, state. Every man is the sole proprietor of
                            his person and is free in the exercise of personal faculties. He may
                            think what he pleases and publish his thoughts in any manner whatsoever.
                            He may engage in any occupation, may go or remain anywhere he pleases,
                            and dispose of his property as seems best.</p>

                        <p>A public force should exist to protect each individual in the enjoyment
                            of his rights. The liberty of each should be rendered so secure by a
                            wise constitution of government that there need be no necessity for the
                            military force except against a foreign enemy. Each citizen is alike
                            subject to the law. There should be an abolition of all privileges, the
                            object of the law being the common interest. Sieyes declared that even
                            if men are not equal in means and differ as regards wealth,
                            intelligence, power, etc., they are equal in rights. The law should
                            protect all without distinction, for no person possesses greater freedom
                            than another. No one ought to be called to justice, seized, or
                            imprisoned except according to the forms prescribed by law. Every
                            arbitrary or illegal order is void; they who demand, sign, or execute
                            such an order are culpable; the citizen against whom it is directed may
                            repel violence by violence. Each citizen is declared to have a right to
                            prompt justice. He is entitled to the common advantages which come from
                            the state of society, and if in need, to the succor of his fellow
                            citizens. The law is said to be the expression of the general will.
                            Unlike Rousseau, Sieyès believed in representation.<ref id="ref_0520"
                                rend="super" target="note_0520">1</ref></p>

                        <p>Sieyès distinguishes in his draft between natural and civil rights on the
                            one hand and political rights on the other. The purpose of society is to
                            develop and maintain the natural and civil rights of men, but society is
                            itself produced by the political rights of the citizens; .that is, while
                            the former are passive rights, the latter are active.<ref id="ref_0521"
                                rend="super" target="note_0521">2</ref></p>

                        <p>He also distinguishes between passive and active citizens. All
                            inhabitants of a country, men, women, strangers, or children, are
                            passive citizens, because all</p>

                        <p>are entitled to the rights of citizens. Active citizens are those who
                            contribute to public establishment. The equality of political rights is
                            a fundamental principle. Every privilege is unjust, odious, and
                            contradictory to the true end of society. The social order necessarily
                            presupposes unity of purpose. Sieyès says that a political association
                            is the work of the unanimous will of the associated. Its public
                            establishment is the result of the will of a plurality of those
                            associated, inasmuch as it is impossible to attain unanimity in a body
                            of many millions. The general will is therefore the will of the
                            plurality. He maintains that all authority comes from the people, and
                            that all public powers, without distinction, are an emanation from the
                            general will. Every public function is a commission, not property; a
                            duty, not a right. All public officers except the king are responsible
                            for their conduct. He asserts that a people has the right to revise its
                            constitution. It is even good that at fixed periods such a revision take
                            place if necessary.<ref id="ref_0522" rend="super" target="note_0522"

                        <p> On the 17th of August Mirabeau, the reporter of the committee of five
                            appointed to draft the Declaration, submitted their project to the
                            Assembly. In his introductory speech he said that it was a difficult
                            task to draw up a Declaration destined for an old and infirm political
                            body, since many local considerations must be regarded; and that the
                            difficulty was so much the greater because the constitution to which
                            this Declaration should form the preamble was not known. What made the
                            task still more arduous was that twenty projects had to be revised in
                            three days.<ref id="ref_0523" rend="super" target="note_0523">2</ref> He
                            said that the committee had clothed the principles in a popular form,
                            which would recall to the people not what they</p>

                        <p>had read in books, but what they themselves experienced. Accordingly, the
                            instrument was written in the language used by the people to express
                            their ideas rather than composed after the nature of a science to be
                            taught them. He considered this an important matter because liberty was
                            never the fruit of philosophica l deductions, but rather of every-day
                            experience and of the simple ideas arising from facts. Mirabeau thought
                            a Declaration would be better understood in proportion as it expressed
                            these popular ideas. He said that the Americans had proceeded thus,
                            having purposely omitted science and presented political truths which
                            could be easily apprehended by the people, for whom alone liberty is
                            intended, and who alone can maintain it. In attempting to imitate them,
                            continued Mirabeau, a great difficulty was encountered in distinguishing
                            what belonged to the nature of man from the modifications his nature had
                            undergone in a particular society, and in declaring the principles of
                            liberty without entering into details and assuming the form of laws. It
                            was hard to resist the temptation to denounce the abuses of despotism,
                            and compose, not a Declaration of the Rights of Man, but a declaration
                            of war against tyrants. Mirabeau said that an ideal declaration must be
                            simple, evident, and fruitful of consequences. He thought circumstances
                            and men in France were not prepared for anything but a feeble attempt at
                            such a Declaration.<ref id="ref_0524" rend="super" target="note_0524"

                        <p>Mirabeau then read the draft framed by the committee, which had either
                            entirely avoided the use of metaphysical generalizations that might be
                            put to a dangerous application, or if it did employ an abstraction,
                            restricted it in a way that limited its scope. This</p>

                        <p>was due to the foresight and carefulness of Mirabeau. Thus, while
                            declaring all men free and equal, equality was in another article
                            defined as meaning, not an equality of property or distinctions, but an
                            equal submission to the law and an equal right to its protection. While
                            asserting that the citizen had the right to employ his powers, his
                            industry, and his property as he pleased, the right was reserved to the
                            law of modifying this liberty if the general welfare necessitated it.
                            Liberty of thought and expression was granted, but with the restriction
                            that the rights of others be regarded. Every political organization was
                            affirmed to be instituted by a social compact by which an individual put
                            his person and property under the supreme direction of the general will.
                            The stipulations of this project were: That all powers emanate from the
                            nation; that the common welfare is the end of government, and that no
                            laws are valid that were not consented to by the people or their
                            representatives; that the law, being the expression of the general will,
                            should be general in its object and ensure to all liberty, property, and
                            civil equality; that the liberty of the citizen consisted in his being
                            subject to the law alone, and to the authority established by law; that
                            the citizen might resist unlawful oppression; that he should enjoy the
                            right of public trial; that accusation, arrest, and imprisonment should
                            be according to legal forms; that punishment should be legal, graduated
                            according to the nature of the offence, and equal for all. It declared
                            further that the citizen might travel or migrate whither he pleased,
                            with legal reservations; that all citizens should have the right of
                            petition, of public meeting in a legal form; that the State alone could
                            demand a sacrifice of private property, and should exercise this right
                            only in case of</p>

                        <p>While a contribution to the public expenses, according to the amount of
                            property, was demanded of each citizen, it was stated that every
                            contribution was contrary to the rights of men if it discouraged
                            industry, excited cupidity, corrupted morals, or deprived the people of
                            their means of subsistence. Accountability of the employment of finances
                            and economy of administration were set down as rigorous duties of the
                            government. The army was to be under the direction and control of the
                            civil authorities.</p>

                        <p>Mirabeau, continuing his address, predicted that the laws passed by the
                            Constituent Assembly would, if they were worthy laws, become the laws of
                            Europe, and that its members were laboring not only for themselves, but
                            also for their descendants and for the whole world.<ref id="ref_0526"

                        <p>On the following day, the 18th of August, the Declaration presented by
                            Mirabeau was laid before the Constituent Assembly for discussion. Rabaut
                            de Saint Etienne said that the Assembly, in occupying itself with a
                            Declaration of Rights, obeyed the demand made in various cahiers, and
                            that these cahiers had spoken of the matter, America having served as a
                            model. He thought that the circumstances in France were not quite the
                            same as in that country and therefore there need be no servile imitation
                            of what had been done by the United States. According to his idea the
                            draft of the committee lacked plan, development, clearness, truth, and
                            precision. He thought the whole world should be able to grasp the
                            principles embodied in an instrument of this kind; that it should become
                            the</p>

                            would give birth to a strong and vigorous race of men who would know how
                            to defend their liberties and repulse despotism, which extended from the
                            foot of the throne to the various ramifications of government.<ref

                        <p>He thought the draft presented, by aiming to be pure and simple, had
                            become insufficient; and therefore demanded that the principles and
                            preservatives the Abb6 Sieyes had inserted in his project, which
                            protected the citizen against the most concealed usurpations of tyranny,
                            be embodied in the Declaration of the committee.<ref id="ref_0528"
                                rend="super" target="note_0528">2</ref></p>

                        <p>Mirabeau arose to defend the work of the committee. He said that if the
                            circumstances were calm, minds peaceable, and sentiments of accord,
                            general maxims might be employed without fear of opposition or of
                            dangerous consequences. But when the most obvious principles attacked a
                            multitude of pretensions and prejudices there would arise such a violent
                            opposition against any particular exposition of rights as would amount
                            to an opposition against every declaration of this kind. Self-love and
                            self-interest would lead to the composition of a mass of declarations.
                            Difficulties would increase infinitely. A Declaration of Rights would be
                            but the almanac of a single year.<ref id="ref_0529" rend="super"

                        <p>Inasmuch as the draft of the committee did not meet with the favor of the
                            Assembly, Reynauld proposed that a plan be chosen, after which a

                            that the draft of the committee alone must serve as the basis for the
                            discussion. It might be altered or even rejected, but until judgment had
                            been passed on it, there could be no talk of another. He dwelt on the
                            difficulties the committee had encountered, and said that it would be
                            still more difficult for so large a body as the Assembly to choose among
                            so many projects as had been presented.</p>

                        <p>Another long discussion ensued. Again no conclusion was reached. Maulette
                            then proposed that the Assembly separate into bureaux and proceed to
                            choose a particular draft; that having the plurality of votes to be
                            submitted for discussion, article by article.</p>

                        <p>To put an end to these interminable disputations Mirabeau at this
                            juncture made a motion that aroused the greatest excitement.</p>

                        <p>No man in France had suffered more than Mirabeau from the evils of the

                        <p> Now he proposed that further action on the Declaration be deferred until
                            the provisions of the constitution were known.<ref id="ref_0532"

                        <p>We learn from Dumont, one of a number of exiled Genevese who assisted
                            Mirabeau in his labors and often composed his speeches, that the latter
                            entrusted his faithful friends with the task of drawing up the
                            Declaration on behalf of the committee of five.<ref id="ref_0533"
                                rend="super" target="note_0533">2</ref> Dumont says the quartet set
                            to work to compose the draft, disputing, now adding a word, now erasing
                            four, and wearying themselves in the attempt to write down Natural
                            Rights which had never existed. He says that the work brought to his
                            mind reflections which he had not made before, and that he saw the
                            undertaking to be ridiculous and a mere puerile fiction, inasmuch as
                            rights can only be declared after the constitution is known, since they
                            are the result of the laws. He had come to the conclusion that the
                            maxims to be embodied in the Declaration were not only untrue, but might
                            become dangerous.<ref id="ref_0534" rend="super" target="note_0534"

                        <p>Whether Mirabeau had been influenced by the opinions of his friend and
                            had changed his views on the value of the Declaration, whether he only
                            wished to prevent the waste of more time because more important problems
                            were pressing, or whether he realized that such a Declaration could only
                            be framed after the terms of the constitution were known, cannot be
                            definitely ascertained. His motion contained nothing to indicate that he
                            was opposed to the Declaration as such. On the contrary, he proposed

                            opposition to his motion. He was accused of using his superior talents

                                rend="super" target="note_0535">1</ref> His proposal was voted down.
                            The Constituent Assembly decided not to make the draft of the committee
                            the basis of its discussions, but to proceed independently.</p>

                        <p>Lally-Tollendal pointed to the great variety of drafts that had been
                            presented, to the difficulty of deciding upon any one of them, and to
                            the endless debates that had already taken place. He asked how the
                            Assembly could hope that twenty-four millions would interpret a
                            Declaration alike if two hundred could not agree upon the sense of its
                            articles. He said that the English, who of all peoples best understood
                            the science of government, had in the various acts which state their
                            liberties, avoided metaphysical questions and general maxims susceptible
                            of denial or dispute, and merely stated facts which no one could deny.
                            He said it was without doubt a great and beautiful idea to expose
                            principles in order to draw consequences from them; to take men to the
                            source of their duties; to inspire them with the dignity of their being
                            before assuring them of the enjoyment of their faculties; and to show
                            them nature before giving them happiness; but he demanded that the
                            Declaration be short and clear; that immediately after a principle was
                            stated its true consequence be drawn, in order to prevent others from
                            drawing false conclusions; and that after having transported mall to

                        <p>forests he be immediately returned to France. Of all the drafts he
                            preferred that of Mounier. He recommended various changes, especially
                            the addition of an article defining the relation of man to a Supreme
                            Being, for in speaking of Nature, he said, one should also speak of its
                            Author; and one ought not forget the first base of all duties, the bond
                            of society, the bridle of the wicked, and the only consolation of the
                            unhappy. Rather than spend much more time upon the Declaration,
                            Lally-Tollendal preferred a postponement of the discussion upon these
                            general maxims. The principles of fact the Assembly was enjoined upon to
                            establish, he said, were independent of the principles of reason from
                            which it was proposed to derive them. It would be better to give the
                            people liberty and tranquillity--to have them enjoy effects, and teach
                            them causes later.<ref id="ref_0536" rend="super" target="note_0536"

                        <p>On the 19th of August the Constituent Assembly chose the draft of the
                            sixth bureau for discussion. On the 20th the preamble of the Declaration
                            and the first three articles, which were those of Mounier, were
                                adopted.<ref id="ref_0537" rend="super" target="note_0537"
                            >2</ref></p>

                        <p>The preamble declares ignorance, neglect, or contempt of the Rights of
                            Man to be the sole causes of public misfortunes and of the corruption of
                            government. In order to keep the rights and duties of all the members of
                            the social body constantly before their minds, the representatives of
                            the French people have resolved to set forth the natural, unalienable,
                            and sacred rights of man in a solemn declaration. This declaration is to
                            serve as the standard with which the people are to compare the acts of
                            the government. Inasmuch as these acts of the government can at any
                            moment be compared with the end of every political institution,</p>

                        <p>they will be more respected. If the claims of citizens are founded on
                            simple and incontestable principles, they will always tend to the
                            maintenance of the constitution and the general happiness. From the
                            preamble it is evident that the Constituent Assembly was influenced by
                            the noblest motives in undertaking to declare the Rights of Man. The
                            members of that body did not believe that they had discovered truths
                            which were now put forth for the first time. These truths were set forth
                            to reveal corruption in the officers of the State, to remind the
                            citizens of their rights and duties, to make them patriotic and
                            law-abiding, to ennoble the spirit of the people. These rights received
                            a religious sanction by being declared in the presence of the Supreme
                            Being.</p>

                        <p>The doctrines promulgated in this Declaration are by no means
                            metaphysical generalities or unrestricted rights, as many writers
                            consider them to be. They are no more general or abstract than those
                            contained in the American Bills of Rights.</p>

                        <p>Art. I. affirms that men are born and continue free and equal in respect
                            to their rights. Civil distinctions can be founded on public utility
                                only.<ref id="ref_0538" rend="super" target="note_0538">1</ref></p>

                        <p>II. The end of all political associations is the preservation of the
                            natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty,
                            property, security, and resistance to oppression.<ref id="ref_0539"

                        <p>III. The source of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation; no
                            body of men, no individual, can exercise any authority that does not

                        <p>The next two articles were presented by Alexander Lameth, one of the
                            young noblemen who had been in America.<ref id="ref_0541" rend="super"
                                target="note_0541">1</ref></p>

                        <p>IV. Liberty consists in the power of doing whatever does not injure
                                another.<ref id="ref_0542" rend="super" target="note_0542">2</ref>
                            The exercise of the natural rights of every man has no other limits than
                            those which are necessary to secure to every other person the free
                            exercise of the same rights; and these limits are determinable only by
                            the law.</p>

                        <p>V. The law ought to prohibit only such actions as are hurtful to society.
                            What is not prohibited by law cannot be hindered, and no one can be
                            constrained to do that which the law does not ordain.</p>

                        <p>The definition of liberty gave rise to a discussion concerning natural
                            right and civil right. Some believed that political, not natural,
                            liberty ought to be spoken of in this connection, for, while the
                            previous articles had referred to man prior to his having entered
                            society, as soon as the law is spoken of, society is already formed. In
                            accordance with this view André proposed the following definition of
                            liberty: "The liberty of the citizen consists in being subject to the
                            law alone, and in being bound to obey no other authority except that
                            established by the law; to be able to use his faculties in every respect
                            the law does not forbid, without fear of punishment." This definition
                            was not adopted.<ref id="ref_0543" rend="super" target="note_0543"

                        <p>Next the discussion turned upon the law and the privileges of the
                            citizens.</p>

                        <p>functions be neither arbitrary nor exclusive. "By like expressions," he
                            said, "the Americans have in their Declarations of Rights extirpated all
                            germs of aristocracy." Others wished the laws to be considered as
                            compacts made by society. The article proposed by Talleyrand was
                            accepted after being amended in several particulars. The definition of
                            the law is that of Rousseau. The article is as follows:</p>

                        <p>VI. The law is the expression of the general will. All citizens have a
                            right to concur, either personally, or by their representatives, in its
                            formation. It should be the same for all, whether it protects or
                            punishes; and all being equal in its sight, are equally eligible to all
                            honors, places, and employments, according to their ability, without any
                            other distinction than that of their virtues and talents.<ref
                                id="ref_0544" rend="super" target="note_0544">1</ref></p>

                        <p>This article is entirely democratic in its nature. It is a manifesto
                            against all political privilege.</p>

                        <p>The next point taken up was arbitrary punishment. Mirabeau insisted that
                            the responsibility of each officer of the State be declared, save that
                            of the head of the nation. He believed this to be the guarantee of
                            liberty. The public force, he said, should be subject to the forms
                            determined by law.<ref id="ref_0545" rend="super" target="note_0545"
                                >2</ref></p>

                        <p>The three articles relating to judicial affairs which were decided upon,
                            meant a radical reform of the judicial system. They were the answer of

                            punished, but every citizen called or seized by virtue of the law, ought

                        <p>IX. Inasmuch as every man is presumed innocent till he has been declared
                            culpable, whenever his detention becomes indispensable, all rigor
                            against him, more than is necessary to secure his person, ought to be
                            provided against by law.</p>

                        <p>A long and interesting discussion took place in the Constituent Assembly
                            concerning religious liberty. Some deputies did not consider religious
                            liberty a right. Others thought the question of religion should be
                            treated in the Constitution, not in the Declaration. Bonnal, Bishop of
                            Clermont, considered religion the base of empires, the eternal reason
                            watching over the order of things, and demanded that the principles of
                            the constitution rest on religion as an eternal basis.<ref id="ref_0549"
                                rend="super" target="note_0549">3</ref> Laborde pleaded for
                            tolerance, regarding the attempt to control religious opinions as the
                            most cruel despotism. He thought liberty of religion a sacred good
                            belonging to every citizen, and urged that strange cults be respected.
                            Mirabeau said that in his eyes the most unlimited liberty of religion
                            was so sacred a right that</p>

                        <p>the word toleration itself seemed to him tyrannical. This was exactly
                            what Madison had said in the Virginia Convention. Diversity of opinions,
                            Mirabeau continued, results from a diversity of minds, and cannot be
                            prevented. Against those who spoke of a dominant cult, he said the word
                            dominant was tyrannical and ought to be banished from legislation.
                            Nothing should dominate except justice. No one should do that which
                            might harm another.<ref id="ref_0550" rend="super" target="note_0550"
                                >1</ref> Rabaut de Saint itienne made an eloquent plea for full
                            religious toleration. He said that one-third of his constituents were
                            Protestants, who enjoyed but imperfect toleration. He attacked those who
                            held that liberty of opinion should be granted, provided the public
                            order were not disturbed by the manifestation of these opinions. He
                            declared this view extremely dangerous. He proposed "that each citizen
                            be free in his opinions, that he have the right to profess his cult
                            freely, and ought not be inquieted for his religion." He said that
                            liberty ought to belong to all Frenchmen equally and in the same manner.
                            Liberty of thought and opinion he held to be the most sacred of rights.
                            It escapes the rule of men, he said, and takes refuge in conscience as a
                            sanctuary whither no mortal has a right to penetrate. It is the only
                            right which men have not put under the laws of the common association:
                            to constrain this right is an injustice, to attack it a sacrilege. He
                            demanded for all non-Catholics equal liberty and equality of rights with
                            the Catholics. He pointed to the "generous" Americans who had put
                            universal religious liberty at the head of their civil code; to the
                            Pennsylvanians who had declared that all who adored a Supreme Being, in

                            his religious opinions, provided their manifestation does not disturb

                        <p>T<hi rend="sc">HERE</hi> is a tendency on the part of some, notably
                            English, writers, to ridicule all political theorizing. Scientific and
                            historical, rather than philosophical studies, have most attraction for
                            the English mind. Thinkers of that nation are inclined to regard it as a
                            fruitless task to grapple with philosophical questions. It is not
                            accidental that Bacon, the man who did perhaps more than any other
                            person in developing the spirit of inductive research to which modern
                            science owes her wonderful triumphs, was an Englishman. To collect
                            facts, rather than build up systems, is characteristic of English
                            intellectual activity. And in accordance with this tendency political
                            theories have been utterly discarded in the English system of
                            government; indeed it is doubtful whether the word system can be
                            legitimately used in speaking of the English constitution, for this
                            constitution is not the product of logical construction, as French
                            constitutions have invariably been, but consists rather of devices
                            dictated by the necessities of the moment. The British government has
                            never recognized those ideas which form the political creed of the
                            American and French Revolutions. Although England has since the earliest
                            days of her history been the example of a free country to the </p>

                        <p>rest of the world, the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people is not
                            recognized. Although almost every adult male can in England acquire the
                            right of suffrage if he desires, full manhood suffrage has not been
                            proclaimed, but the idea of property, rather than that of equality, is
                            still adhered to. The existence of the peerage, which still possesses
                            great social and political privileges, further disagrees with the
                            doctrines of 'equality and popular sovereignty. Neither is there any
                            recognition of the rights of the individual as a man, although nowhere,
                            with the possible exception of America, is the importance of personal
                            liberty more esteemed. Though written safeguards after the American
                            fashion are lacking, the force of custom is so strong that the rights of
                            the citizen are nowhere more secure.</p>

                        <p>While these considerations apply to England they do not apply to other
                            nations, especially not to the American and the French nations, among
                            whom ideas of this sort have been a force in influencing historical
                            development, whose importance can hardly be exaggerated. It is
                            impossible to comprehend the French Revolution without understanding the
                            effects of the so-called "Principles of 1789." It may be said that these
                            ideas form the essence of that movement. De Tocqueville, whose acute and
                            luminous observations have so greatly broadened our views regarding the
                            Revolution and its antecedents, distinguishes between the accidental and
                            transitory features of this period on the one hand, and its essential
                            and permanent characteristics on the other. The antagonism to the Church
                            and hostility against religion he regards as subordinate, while the
                            substance of the Revolution, the most fundamental, the most durable, the
                            truest portion of its work, seems to him to be " the doctrines</p>

                        <p> The most necessary and abiding reforms effected during the Revolution
                            were but the results of applying the doctrines of the Declaration of the
                            Rights of Man to the existing order composing the ancient regime, which
                            was founded upon royal prerogative, social and political inequality, and
                            submission. The consequences of this application of principles to
                            conditions were the reform of the monarchy, of the educational system,
                            abolition of feudal privileges, a radical change in the system of
                            administration and in the judicial organization, as well as a reform of
                            the civil and criminal laws -reforms demanded by the doctrines of
                            equality, liberty, and popular sovereignty, and this work was done
                            logically, yes, mathematically, in accordance with the tendency of the
                            French mind.</p>

                        <p>But let us inquire what the opinions of the men were who drew up this
                            Declaration, regarding the importance of the principles it
                            contained.</p>

                        <p>To Bailly, the famous astronomer, member of three academies, president of
                            the Constituent Assembly, and at one time mayor of Paris, this
                            Declaration seemed both necessary and dangerous; dangerous because of
                            the abuses which wicked and seditious men might commit, forgetting that
                            rights entail duties and that liberty is not license; necessary, because
                            the Rights of Man had been forgotten, otherwise there would have been no
                            Revolution. The first work of the Revolution should be the Declaration
                            of Rights. The first measure of the legislators should be their
                            recognition and proclamation.</p>

                        <p>They should form the basis of the constitution, the thread put into the
                            hand of the legislators to guide them constantly. It was worthy of the
                            wisdom of the Assembly, Bailly holds, not to hesitate in recognizing
                            these rights, and to begin its work upon the constitution with this
                            solemn act, which is the prize of possessing liberty, "an act made by
                            us, for ourselves, but belonging to all mankind as well." <ref
                                id="ref_0561" rend="super" target="note_0561">1</ref></p>

                        <p>Condorcet regards the declaring of the Rights of Man as the only means of
                            preventing tyranny, which is according to him, simply a violation of
                            these rights.<ref id="ref_0562" rend="super" target="note_0562">2</ref>
                            Rabaut de Saint Étienne, the Protestant minister, who is one of the most
                            influential of the actors in the early part of the Revolution, considers
                            the Declaration of Rights the most important achievement of the
                            Revolution. When all other parts of the constitution have perished, this
                            will survive; although it may be submerged it will always come to the
                            top again,--a prediction which has come true. It has established itself
                            easily in America, Rabaut continues, because neither kings, nor priests,
                            nor doctors, nor nobles exist in that country to attack it; but crossing
                            the ocean to the old continent, with its populous cities, its
                            overnumerous cathedrals, towers, monasteries, and dungeons, it has been
                            exposed to the bitterest insults. But he regards this as the new gospel,
                            which will naturally be opposed because it is the good tidings of the
                            lowly and foolishness according to the world. Its mysteries were long
                            hidden, because they attacked the priests and the great.<ref

                        <p>In the preamble to the Declaration, the Constituent Assembly consider
                            ignorance, neglect, or contempt of human rights the sole causes of
                            public misfortunes and corruptions of government. They anticipate as
                            results of the Declaration, that the members of the social body will be
                            kept attentive to their rights and duties; that the acts of the
                            government will be more respected; and that the claims of the citizens
                            will tend to the maintenance of the constitution and the general
                            happiness.</p>

                        <p>The members of the Constituent Assembly felt certain that they were
                            legislating for all mankind. They believed that the eyes of the entire
                            race were upon them; that their work, especially the Declaration of the
                            Rights of Man, would survive the vicissitudes of the ages. And indeed
                            they were hardly mistaken in holding this view, for the effects of their
                            work are still to be felt. The Principles of 1789 have in reality
                            transformed the structure of European government and society. The seeds
                            of liberty have sprung up again and again, despite all exertions to
                            destroy them. While the conquests made by the French during this most
                            brilliant period of their military history have been lost, and almost
                            everything else that was attempted by the leading actors in that great
                            drama has vanished, these ideas still survive as a living force. Despite
                            the numerous political upheavals in France that have occurred since the
                            close of the Revolution, the French people have always returned to these
                            principles. Ideas which have exerted such a fascination \in the past,
                            and have been prized by some of the noblest of the race ever since the
                            time of the Stoics, can hardly be regarded as fallacies, and are on no
                            account to be held in derision.</p>

                        <p>It is but natural that ideas which have exerted such</p>

                        <p>tremendous influence as have the Principles of 1789, should not only find
                            enthusiastic adherents but also bitter opponents. The most famous
                            attack, perhaps, upon the Rights of Man, as upon the influence of the
                            French Revolution on the whole, was that of Edmund Burke, the noted
                            English parliamentarian, in his <hi rend="i">Reflections on the
                                Revolution in France</hi>--a dissertation full of the most striking
                            observations expressed with an unexampled wealth of language, but one in
                            which truth and falsehood, sound judgment and unpardonable prejudice,
                            are strangely mixed. Though Burke's views have been often discussed, at
                            least a brief consideration of them must here be given because of their
                            bearing on our subject.</p>

                        <p>Though Burke, in accordance with almost all of the political philosophers
                            of his age, accepts the theories of Natural Law and a state of Nature,
                            he is really a forerunner of the Historical School of politics,
                            anticipating the notions of Savigny by a quarter of a century. The
                            organic theory of the State could scarcely be expressed more clearly
                            than it is in the following words of Burke's, in which he lays bare the
                            leading error of the Natural Rights School: "Society is, indeed, a
                            contract. Subordinate contracts for objects of mere occasional inter-
                            est may be dissolved at pleasure; but the State ought not to be
                            considered as nothing better than a partnership agreement in a trade of
                            pepper and coffee, calico or tobacco, or some other such low concern, to
                            be taken up for a little temporary interest, and to be dissolved by the
                            fancy of the parties. It is to be looked on with other reverence;
                            because it is not a partnership in things subservient only to the gross
                            animal existence of a temporary and perishable nature. It is a
                            partnership in all science, a partnership in all art, a partnership</p>

                        <pb id="VAB1855-268" n="254"/>

                        <p>in every virtue and in all perfection. As the ends of such a partnership
                            cannot be obtained in many generations, it becomes a partnership not
                            only between those who are living, but between those who are living,
                            those who are dead, and those who are to be born."<ref id="ref_0564"
                                rend="super" target="note_0564">1</ref> The idea of the continuity
                            of the State is thus plainly emphasized. Burke repeatedly attacks the
                            fallacy of supposing that the foundations of the State might be torn up
                            at any moment and replaced by a more suitable substructure. He looks
                            "with horror on those children of their country who are prompt rashly to
                            hack that aged parent in pieces and put him into the kettle of
                            magicians, in hopes that by their poisonous weeds and wild incantations
                            they may regenerate the paternal constitution and renovate their
                            father's life."<ref id="ref_0565" rend="super" target="note_0565"
                                >2</ref> He censures French politicians and writers for their
                            overconfidence in their own wisdom and lack of respect for the wisdom of
                            others; for their love of the new and hatred of the old simply because
                            it is old; for their assumption that governments may vary like modes of
                            dress; for their forgetfulness of the fact that they have duties to
                            perform as well as rights to enjoy.<ref id="ref_0566" rend="super"

                        <p>Burke maintains that if civil society is the result of a convention or
                            contract, laws and constitutions of government framed are the creatures
                            of this convention, and that men have abdicated their Natural Rights,

                            civil state. Government is not made in virtue of Natural Rights, but is
                            a contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants. Men have a
                            right that these wants should be provided for. But the inclinations of
                            men must be frequently thwarted, their will controlled, and their
                            passions brought into subjection, by a power out of themselves. "In this
                            sense, the restraints on men, as well as their liberties, are to be
                            reckoned among their rights. But as the liberties and the restrictions
                            vary with times and circumstances, and admit of infinite modifications,
                            they cannot be settled upon any abstract rule."<ref id="ref_0568"

                        <p>With respect to the Rights of Man Burke says that they are extreme
                            metaphysical rights, which are morally and politically false. He
                            considers the real rights of men to be a sort of middle, incapable of
                            definition, but not of discernment. "The rights of men in government are
                            their advantages; and these are often in balances between differences of
                            good,--in compromises sometimes between good and evil, and sometimes
                            between evil and evil." The intricacy of man's nature and of the objects
                            of society, the gross and complicated mass of human passions and
                            concerns, makes innumerable modifications of the primitive Rights of Man
                                unavoidable.<ref id="ref_0569" rend="super" target="note_0569"

                            English tastes and have no place in the English system of government. He
                            denies that the people of England have the right to choose their own
                            governors, to cashier them for misconduct, or to frame a government for
                            themselves. He asserts that England will ever preserve "an established

                            similar tribunal to interpret the Declaration and apply its principles,
                            the local club in each city or village becomes the champion, the judge,

                            in the destruction of all law and order. Whenever they considered
                            themselves oppressed they would rise up in arms and resist; they might
                            claim the right of demanding personal account of the magistrates, of
                            supervising the legislators; the proletariat might demand the right of

                            the mob would try to legitimize the worst excesses, by appealing to the

                        <p>Taine must have been unfamiliar with the constitutions of the American
                            States, for he says that the American constitution has nothing
                            resembling statements of the Rights of Man. He states that Jefferson's
                            Declaration of Rights was refused, and that merely eleven amendments
                            were added affirming the fundamental liberties of the citizen.</p>

                        <p>Stahl, whose Philosophy of Law still enjoys considerable popularity in
                            Germany, is acquainted with the Bills of Rights of the American States,
                            and rates them very highly, but is hardly fair toward the French
                            Declaration. He says: "The French Constituent Assembly was entranced
                            with the philosophical procedure of North America and imitated it with
                            the greatest exaggeration. While disclaiming any intention of drawing up
                            metaphysical, and not practical rights, hollow and erroneous deductions
                            from Natural Law were placed at the head of the Declaration of the

                        <p>a collection of unrestricted metaphysical principles. That instrument
                            recognizes the fact that the exigencies and needs of civil society make
                            a restriction of individual rights necessary. The language is quite
                            carefully guarded. Thus, the limit to the liberty of any person consists
                            in the equal rights of others; freedom of opinion is granted, but the
                            public order must not be disturbed; freedom of speech and of the press
                            is granted, but the citizen is responsible for the abuse of this
                            liberty. There is nothing incendiary about any of these principles.
                            While in some cases an attempt was made to palliate the crimes committed
                            during the Revolution by appealing to the Rights of Man, it is
                            exceedingly probable that these excesses would have occurred even if
                            there had never been a Declaration of the Rights of Man. It is not this
                            Declaration which caused the September massacres or the Reign of Terror,
                            but the danger threatening the French from the invasion of the foreign
                            foe, the opposition of a large portion of the country against the
                            Revolution, the desire of ambitious individuals to retain their power,
                            and other considerations of like nature. It seems to me that the
                            wholesome effects of these principles far outweighed their evil
                            influence. It is impossible to deny that on the whole the Rights of Man
                            contain good doctrine, and have been productive of incalculable good.
                            Believing that the political development of the French people had been
                            kept back by the misrule of autocratic kings, selfish nobles, worldly
                            churchmen, and grasping magistrates, the Constituent Assembly thought it
                            wise to proclaim the principles they regarded as forming the basis of
                            society, hoping that these principles would guide the legislators in
                            framing the constitution and laws of the state; that they would remind
                            the citizens of their rights and</p>

                        <pb id="VAB1855-273" n="259"/>

                        <p>duties; and that they would serve as a bridle upon all magistrates,
                            restraining them in the exercise of unlawful power. The purposes, there
                            can be no doubt, were noble. But why did the Rights of Man fail to
                            accomplish what was anticipated? There seem to me to be several reasons
                            for this failure.</p>

                        <p>While the Rights of Man had been asserted by the Americans against an
                            external foe, these same doctrines, proclaimed by the French people,
                            became a declaration of war against the privileged classes. The
                            conditions which the Declaration of Man presupposed did not exist in
                            France, as they did, to a considerable extent at least, in America, and
                            therefore liberty, equality, and popular sovereignty had first to be
                            won. This could not happen without exciting the bitterest opposition of
                            the interests threatened. The Rights of Man became a mass of dynamite
                            which shattered the entire social and political fabric. A strong central
                            government might have prevented this upheaval, but that was lacking. Too
                            much inflammable material had been heaped up by centuries of oppression,
                            to which fire was applied by declaring the Rights of Man.</p>

                        <p>Out of the ruins arose a new structure whose foundation was the
                            Declaration of the Rights of Man. It is the constructive, rather than
                            the destructive, side of the Revolution, which ought most to be
                            considered. It cannot be denied that the Rights of Man had much to do in
                            regard to rendering the Revolution a benefit to mankind. The wholesome
                            influence of these ideas might have been still greater, had they been
                            rightly understood.</p>

                        <p>The French people prized equality more highly than liberty. In trying to
                            bring about absolute equality, which will ever remain a dream, they
                            sacrificed liberty.</p>

                        <pb id="VAB1855-274" n="260"/>

                        <p>They failed to see that liberty can exist where considerable inequality
                            prevails, as has been the case in England. The French desired not only
                            equality before the law, but also social and economic equality, which
                            cannot be procured, and which would scarcely be beneficial if it could
                            be obtained. Thus it happened that not only the nobles were proscribed,
                            but the levelling propensity eventually attacked every one whose birth,
                            wealth, or intellect distinguished him above the mob. Liberty seemed to
                            the French to be synonymous with equality of conditions. It was not
                            equality of rights, but equality in fact after which they chased. In the
                            pursuit of this chimera the real Rights of Man were sacrificed. They
                            were entirely unfamiliar with the real nature of liberty. It was to them
                            merely an idea -something existing on paper, but something which they
                            had never tasted and which had not entered the nature of the people.</p>

                        <p>The French did not only confuse liberty and equality, i they likewise
                            believed liberty to be identical with democracy, thus committing the
                            same error as the Greeks and Romans. We have seen that among the
                            ancients the State was everything, the individual nothing, and that in
                            the city-state of antiquity individual rights were constantly overridden
                            by the general will. It was shown that though wielding sovereign power
                            the people may yet be slaves, providing there is nothing to limit the
                            interference of the government with individual rights. The same
                            development occurs in France, even though the Declaration of the Rights
                            of Man was intended to shield the individual against tyranny, whether
                            this tyranny be exercised by the king or by the people themselves. The
                            liberty of the individual is safe only when the sovereignty of the State
                            finds its limits in the rights of the citizen.</p>

                        <pb id="VAB1855-275" n="261"/>

                        <p>The error of the ancients again manifested itself. The views of Locke and
                            others, who had asserted that the State must not interfere with the
                            Natural Rights of Man, even though these views had given birth to the
                            idea of a declaration of the rights which are reserved to the
                            individual, were nevertheless supplanted by the notion to which Rousseau
                            had given expression, that the power of the people is unlimited. It was
                            the prevalence of this latter view which caused liberty to perish. The
                            doctrine of the public welfare becomes destructive of the rights of the
                            individual. The spirit of the Declaration is violated though its
                            principles are on everybody's lips.</p>

                        <p>This victory of the principle of sovereignty over the principle of
                            liberty was not solely due to the influence of Rousseau, great as that
                            influence was upon Robespierre, Saint Just, and other assassins of
                            French liberty. Rousseau himself but represented a deep tendency of the
                            French character--the tendency, namely, toward centralization, which to
                            this day is inimical to individual liberty in France. Whatever our view
                            regarding the origin of this inclination toward centralization may
                            be--whether we regard it as a victory of the Roman influence over the
                            Germanic; whether we ascribe it to the revival of Roman Law and the
                            influence of the legists, who were constantly asserting that what the
                            king wishes is Law; or whether we attribute it to the deliberate
                            creation of the French kings; this tendency can be clearly traced
                            through French history, down to the very present. It was not created by
                            the revolutionists but was inherited from the old <hi rend="i"

                            purpose is to establish the victory of liberty, after which it will be
                            followed by the constitutional regime, which will concern itself
                            principally with civil liberty. The revolutionary government is entirely
                            legitimate, for "it is founded upon the most sacred of all laws, the
                            public welfare, upon the most irrefragable of all titles, necessity."

                            themselves. When a nation is in danger, the rights of the individual
                            disappear, there remain only the rights of the people, and their first
                            right, without doubt, is that of physical and political preservation. In
                            moments of peril or of crisis, a people may and ought to do whatever it
                            believes will conduce to its safety, without being hindered by any
                            personal consideration, or by the fear of violating justice." <ref

                        <p>with the sovereignty of the people. The Rights of Man are trampled upon
                            because the welfare of the State demands it; centralization supplants
                            the self-direction of the individual; the tendency begun by Philip the
                            Fair, continued by Louis XIV., is again taken up by the Mountain, only
                            to be completed by Napoleon; paternalism encroaches more and more upon
                            individual rights until liberty is practically destroyed. Everything \is
                            managed from one centre by the ever active and interfering bureaucracy.
                            Everything is done for the people, in the name of the people, but
                            nothing by the people. The people are considered children whom the
                            government must protect and direct. It is due to the peculiar
                            fascination of the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people, and to the
                            confusion of democracy with liberty, that the Rights of Man were
                            forfeited. Centralization and paternalism are the bane of the French
                            people to this day. France presents the spectacle of a country which is
                            democratic in principle, but which knows little of individual liberty.
                            The celebrated Dreyfus case was a flaring confirmation of the truth of
                            this statement. That the tendency toward centralization is responsible
                            for many evils from which France has long been suffering and is still
                            suffering, has been felt by many of her best men--men of the stamp of
                            Laurent, De Tocqueville, and Laboulaye. It is only by placing the
                            individual upon his own feet, by cultivating individual initiative and
                            self-reliance, by refraining from an excess of legislation and
                            administrative control, by granting to the individual a large measure of
                            liberty and by protecting him in the enjoyment of this liberty; and
                            finally by allowing the people to govern themselves, not only in
                            national, but also in local affairs, that a nation can become and remain
                            strong and</p>

                        <p> great. Under these conditions only can the development of the individual
                            citizens reach its highest stage, and this means likewise the maximum of
                            national power and greatness. "It is in the respect of the person that
                            one can measure the true grandeur of civilization."<ref id="ref_0578"

                            the record of the gradual enfranchisement of the individual. Experience
                            has demonstrated the wisdom of freeing the individual from all
                            unnecessary restraint. Freedom of thought <hi rend="i">(Lehr--und
                                Lernfreiheit)</hi> has given the world German science. Religious
                            freedom has not caused, but prevented, civil disturbances; has not
                            resulted in a decline, but rather in an increase, of religious fervor,
                            as the religious condition of the United States plainly shows. Freedom
                            of trade has not diminished the wealth and commercial power of England.
                            The restriction of the right of public meeting and of public speech has
                            not diminished, but rather increased, the political power of the United
                            States, where these rights are unrestricted, socialism and kindred
                            movements are almost unknown. It is precisely those nations in which the
                            individual enjoys the greatest freedom which are to-day in the lead. If
                            Frnace is lagging somewhat behind, that is due to the fact that she
                            still clings to the paternal system. It is hot Anglo-Saxon race
                            superiority, but rather Anglo-Saxon liberty, to which the greatness of
                            the Germanic powers is due. France can only regain her former power and
                            glory and the station to which the wealth of her resources and the
                            genius of her people entitle her, by forsaking her pernicious system,
                            and returning to the spirit of the Declaration of the Rights of Man.</p>

                        <p>We have assigned two reasons for the failure of the Declaration of the
                            Rights of Man to result in the triumph of personal liberty in France;
                            namely, the undue emphasis put upon actual equality, and the
                            identification of sovereignty with liberty. A third cause of this
                            failure deserves attention. Though the Declaration contains a clause
                            stating that every society in which a guarantee of rights and a
                            separation of the powers of government is wanting, lacks a true
                            constitution, yet the French people neglected to provide for such a
                            guarantee as well as for the separation of the three departments of
                            government. This separation is also lacking in the British constitution,
                            and among any other people but the English, the omnipotence of
                            Parliament might prove disastrous to personal freedom. But in England
                            the force of custom and the respect of personal liberty are such, that
                            they really act as restraints upon Parliament. In the American system of
                            government it is by means of a territorial diffusion of sovereignty
                            among the States and the national government; by means also of our
                            system of "checks and balances"; and especially by the importance of our
                            courts, that the sovereignty of the people is with us restrained and the
                            individual protected in the enjoyment of his rights, not only against
                            the infringement of these rights by other individuals, but also by the
                                government.<ref id="ref_0579" rend="super" target="note_0579"
                                >1</ref> In France safeguards of this sort were, and are still,
                            entirely lacking. Sovereignty there is concentrated; no system of courts
                            exists to protect the individual from the government. In the
                            administrative courts the government, not the individual, is favored. In

                            be exercised either by the administration itself, which would result in
                            despotism, or else the people themselves would interpret the
                            Declaration, in which case mob rule would be the consequence. Both of
                            these eventualities have occurred in France, both have contributed
                            toward rendering liberty nugatory. That which still further fostered the
                            tendency toward direct government by the mob, was the pernicious view of
                            popular sovereignty which Rousseau inculcated. If the general will is
                            but the sum of the individual wills; if this general will, strictly
                            speaking, cannot be delegated, it follows that the people have a direct
                            share in the government, that the legislators and magistrates are on the
                            same level with the people, that the people have the right to see that
                            their will is carried out; mob rule thus received a philosophical
                            foundation. Hereby the respect for law and authority was still further
                            undermined and the pernicious influence of the revolutionary spirit,
                            which has worked such havoc in France, still further aggravated. Seeking
                            liberty, the French people conferred sovereignty upon Napoleon, the
                            Bourbons, Louis Philippe, Napoleon III., only to find that they had, in
                            every case, been deluded.<ref id="ref_0580" rend="super"

                            throughout the world. These principles are the basis of modern liberty.
                            This liberty, the fruit of a struggle between people and their rulers
                            which had been carried on for centuries, will not be forsaken. History
                            shows, as Buckle points out, that there is "an intimate connexion
                            between knowledge and liberty; between an increasing civilization and an
                            advancing democracy." <ref id="ref_0581" rend="super" target="note_0581"

                        <p>Those who hold that public expediency determines the measure of
                            individual rights, believe in a principle which no sound thinker will
                            doubt. If the alternative were between the good of the whole State and
                            the good of an individual, it would be foolish to deny that the good of
                            the whole is of greater significance than that of an infinitesimally
                            small part of the whole. But this alternative does not arise. There is
                            at present a tendency, now that the organic conception of the State is
                            universally accepted, to forget that the State consists of individuals
                            and has no interest apart from theirs. Many persons who are continually
                            speaking of public expediency forget that what we hold to be for the
                            good of the whole may after all be only our own individual view of
                            public expediency. It was in the interests of public expediency, falsely
                            understood, that censorships, the inquisition, repressive measures of
                            all sorts, were established. It was avowedly for the public good that
                            Socrates was put to death; that the Puritans were driven from England;
                            that the Huguenots were oppressed; that Robespierre and his consorts
                            sent thousands to the guillotine; that the English government, during

                <p>Out of the immense number of interesting and important documents in English and
                    American constitutional history Miss Hill has chosen twenty-four documents, or
                    groups of documents, which include the great monuments of Anglo-Saxon liberty,
                    and at the same time are sufficiently representative of the mass of omitted
                    papers. Each of these documents she has prefaced with appropriate "
                    Suggestions," which include some statement of the historical conditions under
                    which the document first saw the light and of the relation of each piece with
                    other materials of the same kind. Then follows in each case the "text" of the
                    document, in translation or transliteration where necessary. After the text of
                    the document follows the "Contemporary Exposition," designed to show why our
                    ancestors felt that the great documents were essential to them and their
                    posterity. The fourth part of each chapter is the "Critical Comment," made up of
                    approved criticism from a considerable number of authorities.</p>

                <p>The most obvious use of such a book is to furnish the backbone of a course in
                    English and American constitutional development, the Outlines of the Appendix
                    serving for an analysis of the whole subject, while the documents are to be a
                    subject of study and thought. It has been adopted for this purpose in normal and
                    other schools, and teachers interested are invited to send for a circular
                    containing opinions and specimen pages.</p>

                <p>In considering the actual workings of the American government the author of this
                    book believes that the real kernel is to be found in that personal interest and
                    personal action which vitalizes government. He discusses not only the machinery
                    but the operations of government, on the ground that functions are more
                    important than details of governmental organization, and lays stress upon the
                    purpose, extent, division, exercise, and limitations of governing power.
                    However, he endeavors to make clear the make-up of governments and the status of
                    officials. The governmental system is treated as a whole.</p>

                <p><hi rend="b">William MacDonald, LL.D.,</hi> Professor of History, Brown
                    University:--" It seems to me to be without question the best text-book of Civil
                    Government ever offered to American students of high-school and college grade. I
                    could wish that it might have large use among those who in our day so greatly
                    need instruction and guidance in the matter of which it treats." </p>

                    University of Pennsylvania :-"A hurried glance has been sufficient to reveal to

                    instruction in regard to the administration of the American Government. I note
                    that in distinction from works on civil government it describes not merely the
                    form and machinery of the government, but their actual operation. This is a new
                    and important contribution to the literature of the subject." </p>

                    serve a significant purpose in high schools and colleges. But its chief
                    usefulness will be in normal schools, where instruction must be a matter of
                    general survey rather than intensive study, and where the method of handling
                    history is made a vital point. For such work Professor Bourne's text would seem

                <p>The aim of this History of England is to give a short narrative of the growth of
                    the British Empire and the Constitution from the earliest times to the present
                    day, and to give a clear and intelligible account of those events and
                    institutions, a knowledge of which is so much needed by the student of modern
                    political life.</p>

                <p>Everywhere I have been guided by what I have learnt, as a practical teacher, of
                    the difficulties which most readers find hardest to surmount, and I have tried
                    to bear in mind that the object of teaching history is not to cram with facts
                    and dates (useful and indeed necessary as these are), but to awaken thought, and
                    especially to teach the habit of thinking intelligently about political
                    events.</p>

                <p>The history is divided into nine books, according to dynasties, and each chapter
                    contains, as a rule, the reign of one king. At the beginning of each book are
                    placed genealogies of the royal families, and pedigrees to illustrate special
                    points are given in the notes. At the head of each reign is a list of notable
                    characters to whom attention is to be directed. Numerous maps and plans are
                    given, with tables of the chief events, and a complete analysis is provided by
                    the table of contents.</p>
