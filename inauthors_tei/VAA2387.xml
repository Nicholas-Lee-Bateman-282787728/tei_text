                        rend="sc">ALCOUR</hi>: You gave me the inspiration which made this story
                    haunt me until I wrote it. Gaspard Roussillon&apos;s letter, a mildewed
                    relic of the year 1788, which you so kindly permitted me to copy, as far as it
                    remained legible, was the point from which my imagination, accompanied by my
                    curiosity, set out upon a long and delightful quest. You laughed at me when I
                    became enthusiastic regarding the possible historical importance of that ancient
                    and, alas! fragmentary epistle; but the old saying about the beatitude of him
                    whose cachinations are latest comes handy to me just now, and I must remind you
                    that &quot;I told you so.&quot; True enough, it was history pure and
                    simple that I had in mind while enjoying the large hospitality of your gulf-side
                    home. Gaspard Roussillon&apos;s letter then appealed to my greed for
                    materials which would help along the making of my little book &quot;The
                    Story of Louisiana.&quot; Later, however, as my frequent calls upon you for
                    both documents and suggestions have informed you, I fell to strumming a
                    different guitar. And now to you I dedicate this historical romance of old
                    Vincennes, as a very appropriate, however slight, recognition of your scholarly
                    attainments, your distinguished career in a noble profession, and your descent
                    from one of the earliest French families (if not the very earliest) long
                    resident at that strange little post on the <pb id="VAA2387-005" n="[]"/>
                    Wabash, now one of the most beautiful cities between the great river and the
                    ocean.</p>
                <p>Following, with ever tantalized expectancy, the broken and breezy hints in the
                    Roussillon letter, I pursued a will-o&apos;-the-wisp, here, there, yonder,
                    until by slowly arriving increments I gathered up a large amount of valuable
                    facts, which when I came to compare them with the history of Clark&apos;s
                    conquest of the Wabash Valley, fitted amazingly well into certain spaces
                    heretofore left open in that important yet sadly imperfect record.</p>
                <p>You will find that I was not so wrong in suspecting that Emile Jazon, mentioned
                    in the Roussillon letter, was a brother of Jean Jazon and a famous scout in the
                    time of Boone and Clark. He was, therefore, a kinsman of yours on the maternal
                    side, and I congratulate you. Another thing may please you, the success which
                    attended my long and patient research with a view to clearing up the connection
                    between Alice Roussillon&apos;s romantic life, as brokenly sketched in M.
                    Roussillon&apos;s letter, and the capture of Vincennes by Colonel George
                    Rogers Clark.</p>
                <p>Accept, then, this book, which to those who care only for history will seem but
                    an idle romance, while to the lovers of romance it may look strangely like the
                    mustiest history. In my mind, and in yours I hope, it will always be connected
                    with a breezy summer-house on a headland of the Louisiana gulf coast, the
                    rustling of palmetto leaves, the fine flash of roses, a tumult of mocking-bird
                    voices, the soft lilt of creole patois, and the endless dash and roar of a
                    fragrant sea over which the gulls and pelicans never ceased their flight, and
                    beside which you smoked while I dreamed.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">UNDER THE CHERRY TREE</head>
                    <p>Up to the days of Indiana&apos;s early statehood, probably as late as
                        1825, there stood, in what is now the beautiful little city of Vincennes on
                        the Wabash, the decaying remnant of an old and curiously gnarled cherry
                        tree, known as the Roussillon tree, <hi rend="i">le cerisier de Monsieur
                            Roussillon</hi>, as the French inhabitants called it, which as long as
                        it lived bore fruit remarkable for richness of flavor and peculiar dark ruby
                        depth of color. The exact spot where this noble old seedling from <hi
                            rend="i">la belle France</hi> flourished, declined, and died cannot be
                        certainly pointed out; for in the rapid and happy growth of Vincennes many
                        land-marks once notable, among them <hi rend="i">le cerisier de Monsieur
                            Roussillon</hi>, have been destroyed and the spots where they stood,
                        once familiar to every eye in old Vincennes, are now lost in the pleasant
                        confusion of the new town.</p>
                    <p>The security of certain land titles may have largely depended upon the
                        disappearance of old, fixed objects here and there. Early records were
                        loosely kept, indeed, scarcely kept at all; many were destroyed by designing
                        land speculators, while those most carefully preserved often failed to give
                        even a shadowy trace of the actual boundaries of the estates held thereby;
                            <pb id="VAA2387-010" n="2"/> so that the position of a house or tree not
                        infrequently settled an important question of property rights left open by a
                        primitive deed. At all events the Roussillon cherry tree disappeared long
                        ago, nobody living knows how, and with it also vanished, quite as
                        mysteriously, all traces of the once important Roussillon estate. Not a
                        record of the name even can be found, it is said, in church or county books.</p>
                    <p>The old, twisted, gum-embossed cherry tree survived every other
                        distinguishing feature of what was once the most picturesque and romantic
                        place in Vincennes. Just north of it stood, in the early French days, a low,
                        rambling cabin surrounded by rude verandas overgrown with grapevines. This
                        was the Roussillon place, the most pretentious home in all the Wabash
                        country. Its owner was Gaspard Roussillon, a successful trader with the
                        Indians. He was rich, for the time and the place, influential to a degree, a
                        man of some education, who had brought with him to the wilderness a bundle
                        of books and a taste for reading.</p>
                    <p>From faded letters and dimly remembered talk of those who once clung fondly
                        to the legends and traditions of old Vincennes, it is drawn that the
                        Roussillon cherry tree stood not very far away from the present site of the
                        Catholic church, on a slight swell of ground overlooking a wide marshy flat
                        and the silver current of the Wabash. If the tree grew there, then there too
                        stood the Roussillon house with its cosy log rooms, its clay-daubed chimneys
                        and its grapevine-mantled verandas, while some distance away and <pb
                            id="VAA2387-011" n="3"/> nearer the river the rude fort with its huddled
                        officers&apos; quarters seemed to fling out over the wild landscape,
                        through its squinting and lopsided port-holes, a gaze of stubborn defiance.</p>
                    <p>Not far off was the little log church, where one good Father Beret, or as
                        named by the Indians, who all loved him, Father Blackrobe, performed the
                        services of his sacred calling; and scattered all around were the cabins of
                        traders, soldiers and woodsmen forming a queer little town, the like of
                        which cannot now be seen anywhere on the earth.</p>
                    <p>It is not known just when Vincennes was first founded; but most historians
                        make the probable date very early in the eighteenth century, somewhere
                        between 1710 and 1730. In 1810 the Roussillon cherry tree was thought by a
                        distinguished botanical letter-writer to be at least fifty years old, which
                        would make the date of its planting about 1760. Certainly as shown by the
                        time-stained family records upon which this story of ours is based, it was a
                        flourishing and wide-topped tree in early summer of 1778, its branches
                        loaded to drooping with luscious fruit. So low did the dark red clusters
                        hang at one point that a tall young girl standing on the ground easily
                        reached the best ones and made her lips purple with their juice while she
                        ate them.</p>
                    <p>That was long ago, measured by what has come to pass on the gentle swell of
                        rich country from which Vincennes overlooks the Wabash. The new town
                        flourishes notably and its appearance marks the latest limit of progress.
                        Electric cars in its streets, electric <pb id="VAA2387-012" n="4"/> lights
                        in its beautiful homes, the roar of railway trains coming and going in all
                        directions, bicycles whirling hither and thither, the most fashionable
                        styles of equipages, from brougham to pony-phaeton, make the days of
                        flint-lock guns and buckskin trousers seem ages down the past; and yet we
                        are looking back over but a little more than a hundred and twenty years to
                        see Alice Roussillon standing under the cherry tree and holding high a
                        tempting cluster of fruit, while a very short, hump-backed youth looks up
                        with longing eyes and vainly reaches for it. The tableau is not merely
                        rustic, it is primitive.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jump!&quot; the girl is saying in French, &quot;jump, Jean;
                        jump high!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Yes, that was very long ago, in the days when women lightly braved what the
                        strongest men would shrink from now.</p>
                    <p>Alice Roussillon was tall, lithe, strongly knit, with an almost perfect
                        figure, judging by what the master sculptors carved for the form of Venus,
                        and her face was comely and winning, if not absolutely beautiful; but the
                        time and the place were vigorously indicated by her dress, which was of
                        coarse stuff and simply designed. Plainly she was a child of the American
                        wilderness, a daughter of old Vincennes on the Wabash in the time that tried
                        men&apos;s souls.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jump, Jean!&quot; she cried, her face laughing with a show of
                        cheek-dimples, an arching of finely sketched brows and the twinkling of
                        large blue-gray eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jump high and get them!&quot;</p>
                    <p>While she waved her sun-browned hand holding <pb id="VAA2387-013" n="5"/> the
                        cherries aloft, the breeze blowing fresh from the southwest tossed her hair
                        so that some loose strands shone like rimpled flames.</p>
                    <p>The sturdy little hunchback did leap with surprising activity; but the
                        treacherous brown hand went higher, so high that the combined altitude of
                        his jump and the reach of his unnaturally long arms was overcome. Again and
                        again he sprang vainly into the air comically, like a long-legged,
                        squat-bodied frog.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you brag of your agility and strength, Jean,&quot; she
                        laughingly remarked; &quot;but you can&apos;t take cherries when
                        they are offered to you. What a clumsy bungler you are.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can climb and get some,&quot; he said with a hideously happy
                        grin, and immediately embraced the bole of the tree, up which he began
                        scrambling almost as fast as a squirrel.</p>
                    <p>When he had mounted high enough to be extending a hand for a hold on a
                        crotch, Alice grasped his leg near the foot and pulled him down, despite his
                        clinging and struggling, until his hands clawed in the soft earth at the
                        tree&apos;s root, while she held his captive leg almost vertically
                        erect.</p>
                    <p>It was a show of great strength; but Alice looked quite unconscious of it,
                        laughing merrily, the dimples deepening in her plump cheeks, her forearm,
                        now bared to the elbow, gleaming white and shapely while its muscles rippled
                        on account of the jerking and kicking of Jean.</p>
                    <p>All the time she was holding the cherries high in her other hand, shaking
                        them by the twig to which <pb id="VAA2387-014" n="6"/> their slender stems
                        attached them, and saying in a sweetly tantalizing tone:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What makes you climb downward after cherries, Jean? What a foolish
                        fellow you are, indeed, trying to grabble cherries out of the ground, as you
                        do potatoes! I&apos;m sure I didn&apos;t suppose that you knew so
                        little as that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her French was colloquial, but quite good, showing here and there what we
                        often notice in the speech of those who have been educated in isolated
                        places far from that babel of polite energies which we call the world;
                        something that may be described as a bookish cast appearing oddly in the
                        midst of phrasing distinctly rustic and local,a peculiarity not easy to
                        transfer from one language to another.</p>
                    <p>Jean the hunchback was a muscular little deformity and a wonder of good
                        nature. His head looked unnaturally large, nestling grotesquely between the
                        points of his lifted and distorted shoulders, like a shaggy black animal in
                        the fork of a broken tree. He was bellicose in his amiable way and never
                        knew just when to acknowledge defeat. How long he might have kept up the
                        hopeless struggle with the girl&apos;s invincible grip would be hard to
                        guess. His release was caused by the approach of a third person, who wore
                        the robe of a Catholic priest and the countenance of a man who had lived and
                        suffered a long time without much loss of physical strength and endurance.</p>
                    <p>This was Pre Beret, grizzly, short, compact, his face deeply lined, his mouth
                        decidedly aslant on account of some lost teeth, and his eyes set deep under
                            <pb id="VAA2387-015" n="7"/> gray, shaggy brows. Looking at him when his
                        features were in repose a first impression might not have been favorable;
                        but seeing him smile or hearing him speak changed everything. His voice was
                        sweetness itself and his smile won you on the instant. Something like a
                        pervading sorrow always seemed to be close behind his eyes and under his
                        speech; yet he was a genial, sometimes almost jolly, man, very prone to join
                        in the lighter amusements of his people.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Children, children, my children,&quot; he called out as he
                        approached along a little pathway leading up from the direction of the
                        church, &quot;what are you doing now? Bah there, Alice, will you pull
                        Jean&apos;s leg off?&quot;</p>
                    <p>At first they did not hear him, they were so nearly deafened by their own
                        vocal discords.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why are you standing on your head with your feet so high in air,
                        Jean?&quot; he added. &quot;It&apos;s not a polite attitude in
                        the presence of a young lady. Are you a pig, that you poke your nose in the
                        dirt?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice now turned her bright head and gave Pre Beret a look of frank welcome,
                        which at the same time shot a beam of willful self-assertion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My daughter, are you trying to help Jean up the tree feet
                        foremost?&quot; the priest added, standing where he had halted just
                        outside of the straggling yard fence.</p>
                    <p>He had his hands on his hips and was quietly chuckling at the scene before
                        him, as one who, although old, sympathized with the natural and harmless
                        sportiveness of young people and would as lief as not join in a prank or
                        two.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You see what I&apos;m doing, Father Beret,&quot; said
                        Alice. <pb id="VAA2387-016" n="8"/> &quot;I am preventing a great damage
                        to you. You will maybe lose a good many cherry pies and dumplings if I let
                        Jean go. He was climbing the tree to pilfer the fruit; so I pulled him down,
                        you understand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ta, ta!&quot; exclaimed the good man, shaking his gray head;
                        &quot;we must reason with the child. Let go his leg, daughter, I will
                        vouch for him; eh, Jean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice released the hunchback, then laughed gayly and tossed the cluster of
                        cherries into his hand, whereupon he began munching them voraciously and
                        talking at the same time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I knew I could get them,&quot; he boasted; &quot;and see, I
                        have them now.&quot; He hopped around, looking like a species of
                        ill-formed monkey.</p>
                    <p>Pre Beret came and leaned on the low fence close to Alice. She was almost as
                        tall as he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The sun scorches to-day,&quot; he said, beginning to mop his
                        furrowed face with a red-flowered cotton handkerchief; &quot;and from
                        the look of the sky yonder,&quot; pointing southward, &quot;it is
                        going to bring on a storm. How is Madame Roussillon to-day?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is complaining as she usually does when she feels extremely
                        well,&quot; said Alice; &quot;that&apos;s why I had to take her
                        place at the oven and bake pies. I got hot and came out to catch a bit of
                        this breeze. Oh, but you needn&apos;t smile and look greedy, Pre Beret,
                        the pies are not for your teeth!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My daughter, I am not a glutton, I hope; I had meat not two hours
                        sincesome broiled young squirrels with cress, sent me by Ren de Ronville. He
                        never forgets his old father.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-017" n="9"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I never forget you either, <hi rend="i">mon pre;</hi> I thought
                        of you to-day every time I spread a crust and filled it with cherries; and
                        when I took out a pie all brown and hot, the red juice bubbling out of it so
                        good smelling and tempting, do you know what I said to myself?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How could I know, my child?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I thought this: `Not a single bite of that pie does Father
                        Beret get.&apos; &quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why so, daughter?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because you said it was bad of me to read novels and told Mother
                        Roussillon to hide them from me. I&apos;ve had any amount of trouble
                        about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ta, ta! read the good books that I gave you. They will soon kill
                        the taste for these silly romances.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I tried,&quot; said Alice; &quot;I tried very hard, and
                        it&apos;s no use; your books are dull and stupidly heavy. What do I care
                        about something that a queer lot of saints did hundreds of years ago in
                        times of plague and famine? Saints must have been poky people, and it is
                        poky people who care to read about them, I think. I like reading about
                        brave, heroic men and beautiful women, and war and love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Pre Beret looked away with a curious expression in his face, his eyes half
                        closed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I&apos;ll tell you now, Father Beret,&quot; Alice went
                        on after a pause, &quot;no more claret and pies do you get until I can
                        have my own sort of books back again to read as I please.&quot; She
                        stamped her moccasin-shod foot with decided energy.</p>
                    <p>The good priest broke into a hearty laugh, and taking <pb id="VAA2387-018"
                            n="10"/> off his cap of grass-straw mechanically scratched his bald
                        head. He looked at the tall, strong girl before him for a moment or two, and
                        it would have been hard for the best physiognomist to decide just how much
                        of approval and how much of disapproval that look really signified.</p>
                    <p>Although, as Father Beret had said, the sun&apos;s heat was violent,
                        causing that gentle soul to pass his bundled handkerchief with a wiping
                        circular motion over his bald and bedewed pate, the wind was momently
                        freshening, while up from behind the trees on the horizon beyond the river,
                        a cloud was rising blue-black, tumbled, and grim against the sky.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the priest, evidently trying hard to exchange
                        his laugh for a look of regretful resignation, &quot;you will have your
                        own way, my child, and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then you will have pies galore and no end of claret!&quot; she
                        interrupted, at the same time stepping to the withe-tied and peg-latched
                        gate of the yard and opening it. &quot;Come in, you dear, good Father,
                        before the rain shall begin, and sit with me on the gallery&quot; (the
                        creole word for veranda) &quot;till the storm is over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret seemed not loath to enter, albeit he offered a weak protest
                        against delaying some task he had in hand. Alice reached forth and pulled
                        him in, then reclosed the queer little gate and pegged it. She caressingly
                        passed her arm through his and looked into his weather-stained old face with
                        childlike affection.</p>
                    <p>There was not a photographer&apos;s camera to be had in those days; but
                        what if a tourist with one in hand could have been there to take a snapshot
                        at the priest and <pb id="VAA2387-019" n="[]"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2387-020" n="11"/> the maiden as they walked arm in arm to that
                        squat little veranda! The picture to-day would be worth its weight in a
                        first-water diamond. It would include the cabin, the cherry-tree, a glimpse
                        of the raw, wild background and a sharp portrait-group of Pre Beret, Alice,
                        and Jean the hunchback. To compare it with a photograph of the same spot now
                        would give a perfect impression of the historic atmosphere, color and
                        conditions which cannot be set in words. But we must not belittle the power
                        of verbal description. What if a thoroughly trained newspaper reporter had
                        been given the freedom of old Vincennes on the Wabash during the first week
                        of June, 1778, and we now had his printed story! What a supplement to the
                        photographer&apos;s pictures! Well, we have neither photographs nor
                        graphic report; yet there they are before us, the gowned and straw-capped
                        priest, the fresh-faced, coarsely-clad and vigorous girl, the grotesque
                        little hunchback, all just as real as life itself. Each of us can see them,
                        even with closed eyes. Led by that wonderful guide, Imagination, we step
                        back a century and more to look over a scene at once strangely attractive
                        and unspeakably forlorn.</p>
                    <p>What was it that drew people away from the old countries, from the cities,
                        the villages and the vineyards of beautiful France, for example, to dwell in
                        the wilderness, amid wild beasts and wilder savage Indians, with a rude
                        cabin for a home and the exposures and hardships of pioneer life for their
                        daily experience?</p>
                    <p>Men like Gaspard Roussillon are of a distinct stamp. Take him as he was. Born
                        in France, on the banks of <pb id="VAA2387-021" n="12"/> the Rhone near
                        Avignon, he came as a youth to Canada, whence he drifted on the tide of
                        adventure this way and that, until at last he found himself, with a wife, at
                        Post Vincennes, that lonely picket of religion and trade, which was to
                        become the center of civilizing energy for the great Northwestern Territory.
                        M. Roussillon had no children of his own; so his kind heart opened freely to
                        two fatherless and motherless waifs. These were Alice, now called Alice
                        Roussillon, and the hunchback, Jean. The former was twelve years old, when
                        he adopted her, a child of Protestant parents, while Jean had been taken,
                        when a mere babe, after his parents had been killed and scalped by Indians.
                        Madame Roussillon, a professed invalid, whose appetite never failed and
                        whose motherly kindness expressed itself most often through strains of
                        monotonous falsetto scolding, was a woman of little education and no
                        refinement; while her husband clung tenaciously to his love of books,
                        especially to the romances most in vogue when he took leave of France.</p>
                    <p>M. Roussillon had been, in a way, Alice&apos;s teacher, though not
                        greatly inclined to abet Father Beret in his kindly efforts to make a
                        Catholic of the girl, and most treacherously disposed toward the good priest
                        in the matter of his well-meant attempts to prevent her from reading and
                        re-reading the aforesaid romances. But for many weeks past Gaspard
                        Roussillon had been absent from home, looking after his trading schemes with
                        the Indians; and Pre Beret acting on the suggestion of the proverb about the
                        absent cat and the playing mouse, had formed an alliance offensive and
                        defensive <pb id="VAA2387-022" n="13"/> with Madame Roussillon, in which it
                        was strictly stipulated that all novels and romances were to be forcibly
                        taken and securely hidden away from Mademoiselle Alice; which, to the best
                        of Madame Roussillon&apos;s ability, had accordingly been done.</p>
                    <p>Now, while the wind strengthened and the softly booming summer shower came on
                        apace, the heavy cloud lifting as it advanced and showing under it the dark
                        gray sheet of the rain, Pre Beret and Alice sat under the clapboard roof
                        behind the vines of the veranda and discussed, what was generally uppermost
                        in the priest&apos;s mind upon such occasions, the good of
                        Alice&apos;s immortal soul,a subject not absorbingly interesting to her
                        at any time.</p>
                    <p>It was a standing grief to the good old priest, this strange perversity of
                        the girl in the matter of religious duty, as he saw it. True she had a
                        faithful guardian in Gaspard Roussillon; but, much as he bad done to aid the
                        church&apos;s work in general, for he was always vigorous and liberal,
                        he could not be looked upon as a very good Catholic; and of course his
                        influence was not effective in the right direction. But then Pre Beret saw
                        no reason why, in due time and with patient work, aided by Madame Roussillon
                        and notwithstanding Gaspard&apos;s treachery, he might not safely lead
                        Alice, whom he loved as a dear child, into the arms of the Holy Church, to
                        serve which faithfully, at all hazards and in all places, was his highest
                        aim.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, my child,&quot; he was saying, &quot;you are a sweet,
                        good girl, after all, much better than you make yourself <pb
                            id="VAA2387-023" n="14"/> out to be. Your duty will control you; you
                        will do it nobly at last, my child.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;True enough, Father Beret, true enough!&quot; she responded,
                        laughing, &quot;your perception is most excellent, which I will prove to
                        you immediately.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She rose while speaking and went into the house.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll return in a minute or two,&quot; she called back
                        from a region which Pre Beret well knew was that of the pantry;
                        &quot;don&apos;t get impatient and go away!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Pre Beret laughed softly at the preposterous suggestion that he would even
                        dream of going out in the rain, which was now roaring heavily on the loose
                        board roof, and miss a cut of cherry piea cherry pie of Alice&apos;s
                        making! And the Roussillon claret, too, was always excellent. &quot;Ah,
                        child,&quot; he thought, &quot;your old Father is not going
                        away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She presently returned, bearing on a wooden tray a ruby-stained pie and a
                        short, stout bottle flanked by two glasses.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course I&apos;m better than I sometimes appear to
                        be,&quot; she said, almost humbly, but with mischief still in her voice
                        and eyes, &quot;and I shall get to be very good when I have grown old.
                        The sweetness of my present nature is in this pie.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She set the tray on a three-legged stool which she pushed close to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There now,&quot; she said, &quot;let the rain come,
                        you&apos;ll be happy, rain or shine, while the pie and wine last,
                        I&apos;ll be bound.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Pre Beret fell to eating right heartily, meantime handing Jean a liberal
                        piece of the luscious pie.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-024" n="15"/>
                    <p>&quot;It is good, my daughter, very good, indeed,&quot; the priest
                        remarked with his mouth full. &quot;Madame Roussillon has not neglected
                        your culinary education.&quot; Alice filled a glass for him. It was
                        Bordeaux and very fragrant. The bouquet reminded him of his sunny boyhood in
                        France, of his journey up to Paris and of his careless, joy-brimmed youth in
                        the gay city. How far away, how misty, yet how thrillingly sweet it all was!
                        He sat with half closed eyes awhile, sipping and dreaming.</p>
                    <p>The rain lasted nearly two hours; but the sun was out again when Pre Beret
                        took leave of his young friend. They had been having another good-natured
                        quarrel over the novels, and Madame Roussillon had come out on the veranda
                        to join in.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve hidden every book of them,&quot; said Madame, a
                        stout and swarthy woman whose pearl-white teeth were her only mark of
                        beauty. Her voice indicated great stubbornness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good, good, you have done your very duty, Madame,&quot; said
                        Pre Beret, with immense approval in his charming voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, Father, you said awhile ago that I should have my own way
                        about this,&quot; Alice spoke up with spirit; &quot;and on the
                        strength of that remark of yours I gave you the pie and wine.
                        You&apos;ve eaten my pie and swigged the wine, and now&quot;</p>
                    <p>Pre Beret put on his straw cap, adjusting it carefully over the shining dome
                        out of which had come so many thoughts of wisdom, kindness and human
                        sympathy. <pb id="VAA2387-025" n="16"/> This done, he gently laid a hand on
                        Alice&apos;s bright crown of hair and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bless you, my child. I will pray to the Prince of Peace for you as
                        long as I live, and I will never cease to beg the Holy Virgin to intercede
                        for you and lead you to the Holy Church.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned and went away; but when he was no farther than the gate, Alice
                        called out:</p>
                    <p>&quot;O Father Beret, I forgot to show you something!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She ran forth to him and added in a low tone:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know that Madame Roussillon has hidden all the novels from
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was fumbling to get something out of the loose front of her dress.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, just take a glance at this, will you?&quot; and she
                        showed him a little leather bound volume, much cracked along the hinges of
                        the back.</p>
                    <p>It was <hi rend="i">Manon Lescaut</hi>, that dreadful romance by the famous
                        Abb Prevost.</p>
                    <p>Pre Beret frowned and went his way shaking his head; but before he reached
                        his little hut near the church he was laughing in spite of himself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s not so bad, not so bad,&quot; he thought aloud,
                        &quot;it&apos;s only her young, independent spirit taking the bit
                        for a wild run. In her sweet soul she is as good as she is
                    pure.&quot;</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">A LETTER FROM AFAR</head>
                    <p>Although Father Beret was for many years a missionary on the Wabash, most of
                        the time at Vincennes, the fact that no mention of him can be found in the
                        records is not stranger than many other things connected with the old
                        town&apos;s history. He was, like nearly all the men of his calling in
                        that day, a self-effacing and modest hero, apparently quite unaware that he
                        deserved attention. He and Father Gibault, whose name is so beautifully and
                        nobly connected with the stirring achievements of Colonel George Rogers
                        Clark, were close friends and often companions. Probably Father Gibault
                        himself, whose fame will never fade, would have been to-day as obscure as
                        Father Beret, but for the opportunity given him by Clark to fix his name in
                        the list of heroic patriots who assisted in winning the great Northwest from
                        the English.</p>
                    <p>Vincennes, even in the earliest days of its history, somehow kept up
                        communication and, considering the circumstances, close relations with New
                        Orleans. It was much nearer Detroit; but the Louisiana colony stood next to
                        France in the imagination and longing of priests, <hi rend="i">voyageurs,
                            coureurs de bois</hi> and reckless adventurers who had Latin blood in
                        their veins. Father Beret first came to Vincennes from New Orleans, the
                        voyage up the Mississippi, Ohio, and Wabash, in a pirogue, lasting through a
                        whole summer and far into <pb id="VAA2387-027" n="18"/> the autumn. Since
                        his arrival the post had experienced many vicissitudes, and at the time in
                        which our story opens the British government claimed right of dominion over
                        the great territory drained by the Wabash, and, indeed, over a large,
                        indefinitely outlined part of the North American continent lying above
                        Mexico; a claim just then being vigorously questioned, flintlock in hand, by
                        the Anglo-American colonies.</p>
                    <p>Of course the handful of French people, at Vincennes, so far away from every
                        center of information, and wholly occupied with their trading, trapping and
                        missionary work, were late finding out that war existed between England and
                        her colonies. Nor did it really matter much with them, one way or another.
                        They felt secure in their lonely situation, and so went on selling their
                        trinkets, weapons, domestic implements, blankets and intoxicating liquors to
                        the Indians, whom they held bound to them with a power never possessed by
                        any other white dwellers in the wilderness. Father Beret was probably
                        subordinate to Father Gibault. At all events the latter appears to have had
                        nominal charge of Vincennes, and it can scarcely be doubted that he left
                        Father Beret on the Wabash, while he went to live and labor for a time at
                        Kaskaskia beyond the plains of Illinois.</p>
                    <p>It is a curious fact that religion and the power of rum and brandy worked
                        together successfully for a long time in giving the French posts almost
                        absolute influence over the wild and savage men by whom they were always
                        surrounded. The good priests deprecated the traffic in liquors and tried
                        hard to control <pb id="VAA2387-028" n="19"/> it, but soldiers of fortune
                        and reckless traders were in the majority, their interests taking precedence
                        of all spiritual demands and carrying everything along. What could the brave
                        missionaries do but make the very best of a perilous situation?</p>
                    <p>In those days wine was drunk by almost everybody, its use at table and as an
                        article of incidental refreshment and social pleasure being practically
                        universal; wherefore the steps of reform in the matter of intemperance were
                        but rudimentary and in all places beset by well-nigh insurmountable
                        difficulties. In fact the exigencies of frontier life demanded, perhaps, the
                        very stimulus which, when over indulged in, caused so much evil. Malaria
                        loaded the air, and the most efficacious drugs now at command were then
                        undiscovered or could not be had. Intoxicants were the only popular
                        specific. Men drank to prevent contracting ague, drank again, between
                        rigors, to cure it, and yet again to brace themselves during convalescence.</p>
                    <p>But if the effect of rum as a beverage had strong allurement for the white
                        man, it made an absolute slave of the Indian, who never hesitated for a
                        moment to undertake any task, no matter how hard, bear any privation, even
                        the most terrible, or brave any danger, although it might demand reckless
                        desperation, if in the end a well filled bottle or jug appeared as his
                        reward.</p>
                    <p>Of course the traders did not overlook such a source of power. Alcoholic
                        liquor became their implement of almost magical work in controlling the
                        lives, labors, and resources of the Indians. The priests with their <pb
                            id="VAA2387-029" n="20"/> captivating story of the Cross had a large
                        influence in softening savage natures and averting many an awful danger; but
                        when everything else failed, rum always came to the rescue of a threatened
                        French post.</p>
                    <p>We need not wonder, then, when we are told that Father Beret made no sign of
                        distress or disapproval upon being informed of the arrival of a boat loaded
                        with rum, brandy or gin. It was Ren de Ronville who brought the news, the
                        same Ren already mentioned as having given the priest a plate of squirrels.
                        He was sitting on the doorsill of Father Beret&apos;s hut, when the old
                        man reached it after his visit at the Roussillon home, and held in his hand
                        a letter which he appeared proud to deliver.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A batteau and seven men, with a cargo of liquor, came during the
                        rain,&quot; he said, rising and taking off his curious cap, which, made
                        of an animal&apos;s skin, had a tail jauntily dangling from its
                        crown-tip; &quot;and here is a letter for you, Father. The batteau is
                        from New Orleans. Eight men started with it; but one went ashore to hunt and
                        was killed by an Indian.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret took the letter without apparent interest and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you, my son, sit down again; the door-log is not wetter than
                        the stools inside; I will sit by you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The wind had driven a flood of rain into the cabin through the open door, and
                        water twinkled in puddles here and there on the floor&apos;s puncheons.
                        They sat down side by side, Father Beret fingering the letter in an
                        absent-minded way.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-030" n="21"/>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;ll be a jolly time of it to-night,&quot; Ren de
                        Ronville remarked, &quot;a roaring time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why do you say that, my son?&quot; the priest demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The wine and the liquor,&quot; was the reply; &quot;much
                        drinking will be done. The men have all been dry here for some time, you
                        know, and are as thirsty as sand. They are making ready to enjoy themselves
                        down at the river house.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, the poor souls!&quot; sighed Father Beret, speaking as one
                        whose thoughts were wandering far away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you read your letter, Father?&quot; Ren
                        added.</p>
                    <p>The priest started, turned the soiled square of paper over in his hand, then
                        thrust it inside his robe.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It can wait,&quot; he said. Then, changing his voice;
                        &quot;the squirrels you gave me were excellent, my son. It was good of
                        you to think of me,&quot; he added, laying his hand on Ren&apos;s
                        arm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;m glad if I have pleased you, Father Beret, for you
                        are so kind to me always, and to everybody. When I killed the squirrels I
                        said to myself: `These are young, juicy and tender, Father Beret must have
                        these,&apos; so I brought them along.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The young man rose to go; for he was somehow impressed that Father Beret must
                        wish opportunity to read his letter, and would prefer to be left alone with
                        it. But the priest pulled him down again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stay a while,&quot; he said, &quot;I have not had a talk
                        with you for some time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ren looked a trifle uneasy.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-031" n="22"/>
                    <p>&quot;You will not drink any to-night, my son,&quot; Father Beret
                        added. &quot;You must not; do you hear?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The young man&apos;s eyes and mouth at once began to have a sullen
                        expression; evidently he was not pleased and felt rebellious; but it was
                        hard for him to resist Father Beret, whom he loved, as did every soul in the
                        post. The priest&apos;s voice was sweet and gentle, yet positive to a
                        degree. Ren did not say a word.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Promise me that you will not taste liquor this night,&quot;
                        Father Beret went on, grasping the young man&apos;s arm more firmly;
                        &quot;promise me, my son, promise me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Still Ren was silent. The men did not look at each other, but gazed away
                        across the country beyond the Wabash to where a glory from the western sun
                        flamed on the upper rim of a great cloud fragment creeping along the
                        horizon. Warm as the day had been, a delicious coolness now began to temper
                        the air; for the wind had shifted into the northwest. A meadow-lark sang
                        dreamingly in the wild grass of the low lands hard by, over which two or
                        three prairie hawks hovered with wings that beat rapidly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Eh bien</hi>, I must go,&quot; said Ren presently,
                        getting to his feet nimbly and evading Father Beret&apos;s hand which
                        would have held him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not to the river house, my son?&quot; said the priest
                        appealingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, not there; I have another letter; one for
                        M&apos;sieu&apos; Roussillon; it came by the boat too. I go to give
                        it to Madame Roussillon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ren de Ronville was a dark, weather-stained young <pb id="VAA2387-032" n="23"
                        /> fellow, neither tall nor short, wearing buckskin moccasins, trousers and
                        tunic. His eyes were dark brown, keen, quick-moving, set well under heavy
                        brows. A razor had probably never touched his face, and his thin, curly
                        beard crinkled over his strongly turned cheeks and chin, while his
                        moustaches sprang out quite fiercely above his full-lipped, almost sensual
                        mouth. He looked wiry and active, a man not to be lightly reckoned with in a
                        trial of bodily strength and will power.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret&apos;s face and voice changed on the instant. He laughed
                        dryly and said, with a sly gleam in his eyes:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You could spend the evening pleasantly with Madame Rousillon and
                        Jean. Jean, you know, is a very amusing fellow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ren brought forth the letter of which he had spoken and held it up before
                        Father Beret&apos;s face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe you think I haven&apos;t any letter for
                        M&apos;sieu&apos; Roussillon,&quot; he blurted; &quot;and
                        maybe you are quite certain that I am not going to the house to take the
                        letter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Monsieur Roussillon is absent, you know,&quot; Father Beret
                        suggested. &quot;But cherry pies are just as good while he&apos;s
                        gone as when he&apos;s at home, and I happen to know that there are some
                        particularly delicious ones in the pantry of Madame Roussillon. Mademoiselle
                        Alice gave me a juicy sample; but then I dare say you do not care to have
                        your pie served by her hand. It would interfere with your appetite; eh, my
                        son?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ren turned short about wagging his head and laughing, and so with his back to
                        the priest he strode <pb id="VAA2387-033" n="24"/> away along the wet path
                        leading to the Roussillon place.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret gazed after him, his face relaxing to a serious expression in
                        which a trace of sadness and gloom spread like an elusive twilight. He took
                        out his letter, but did not glance at it, simply holding it tightly gripped
                        in his sinewy right hand. Then his old eyes stared vacantly, as eyes do when
                        their sight is cast back many, many years into the past. The missive was
                        from beyond the seahe knew the handwritinga waft of the flowers of Avignon
                        seemed to rise out of it, as if by the pressure of his grasp.</p>
                    <p>A stoop-shouldered, burly man went by, leading a pair of goats, a kid
                        following. He was making haste excitedly, keeping the goats at a lively
                        trot.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Bon jour</hi>, Pre Beret,&quot; he flung out
                        breezily, and walked rapidly on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, ah; his mind is busy with the newly arrived cargo,&quot;
                        thought the old priest, returning the salutation; &quot;his throat aches
                        for the liquor,the poor man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then he read again the letter&apos;s superscription and made a faltering
                        move, as if to break the seal. His hands trembled violently, his face looked
                        gray and drawn.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come on, you brutes,&quot; cried the receding man, jerking the
                        thongs of skin by which he led the goats.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret rose and turned into his damp little hut, where the light was
                        dim on the crucifix hanging opposite the door against the clay-daubed wall.
                        It was a bare, unsightly, clammy room; a rude bed on one side, a shelf for
                        table and two or three wooden stools <pb id="VAA2387-034" n="25"/>
                        constituting the furniture, while the uneven puncheons of the floor wabbled
                        and clattered under the priest&apos;s feet.</p>
                    <p>An unopened letter is always a mysterious thing. We who receive three or four
                        mails every day, scan each little paper square with a speculative eye. Most
                        of us know what sweet uncertainty hangs on the opening of envelopes whose
                        contents may be almost anything except something important, and what a vague
                        yet delicious thrill comes with the snip of the paper knife; but if we be in
                        a foreign land and long years absent from home, then is a letter subtly
                        powerful to move us, even more before it is opened than after it is read.</p>
                    <p>It had been many years since a letter from home had come to Father Beret. The
                        last, before the one now in hand, had made him ill of nostalgia, fairly
                        shaking his iron determination never to quit for a moment his life work as a
                        missionary. Ever since that day he had found it harder to meet the many and
                        stern demands of a most difficult and exacting duty. Now the mere touch of
                        the paper in his hand gave him a sense of returning weakness,
                        dissatisfaction, and longing. The home of his boyhood, the rushing of the
                        Rhone, a seat in a shady nook of the garden, Madeline, his sister, prattling
                        beside him, and his mother singing somewhere about the houseit all came back
                        and went over him and through him, making his heart sink strangely, while
                        another voice, the sweetest ever heardbut she was ineffable and her memory a
                        forbidden fragrance.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret tottered across the forlorn little room and knelt before the
                        crucifix holding his clasped hands <pb id="VAA2387-035" n="26"/> high, the
                        letter pressed between them. His lips moved in prayer, but made no sound;
                        his whole frame shook violently.</p>
                    <p>It would be unpardonable desecration to enter the chamber of Father
                        Beret&apos;s soul and look upon his sacred and secret trouble; nor must
                        we even speculate as to its particulars. The good old man writhed and
                        wrestled before the cross for a long time, until at last he seemed to
                        receive the calmness and strength he prayed for so fervently; then he rose,
                        tore the letter into pieces so small that not a word remained whole, and
                        squeezed them so firmly together that they were compressed into a tiny,
                        solid ball, which he let fall through a crack between the floor puncheons.
                        After waiting twenty years for that letter, hungry as his heart was, he did
                        not even open it when at last it arrived. He would never know what message
                        it bore. The link between him and the old sweet days was broken forever. Now
                        with God&apos;s help he could do his work to the end.</p>
                    <p>He went and stood in his doorway, leaning against the side. Was it a mere
                        coincidence that the meadowlark flew up just then from its grass-tuft, and
                        came to the roof&apos;s comb overhead, where it lit with a light yet
                        audible stroke of its feet and began fluting its tender, lonesome-sounding
                        strain? If Father Beret heard it he gave no sign of recognition; very likely
                        he was thinking about the cargo of liquor and how he could best counteract
                        its baleful influence. He looked toward the &quot;river house,&quot;
                        as the inhabitants had named a large shanty, which stood on a bluff of the
                        Wabash not far <pb id="VAA2387-036" n="27"/> from where the road-bridge at
                        present crosses, and saw men gathering there.</p>
                    <p>Meantime Ren de Ronville had delivered Madame Roussillon&apos;s letter
                        with due promptness. Of course such a service demanded pie and claret. What
                        still better pleased him, Alice chose to be more amiable than was usually
                        her custom when he called. They sat together in the main room of the house
                        where M. Roussillon kept his books, his curiosities of Indian manufacture
                        collected here and there, and his surplus firearms, swords, pistols, and
                        knives, ranged not unpleasingly around the walls.</p>
                    <p>Of course, along with the letter, Ren bore the news, so interesting to
                        himself, of the boat&apos;s tempting cargo just discharged at the river
                        house. Alice understood her friend&apos;s dangerfelt it in the intense
                        enthusiasm of his voice and manner. She had once seen the men carousing on a
                        similar occasion when she was but a child, and the impression then made
                        still remained in her memory. Instinctively she resolved to hold Ren by one
                        means or another away from the river house if possible. So she managed to
                        keep him occupied eating pie, sipping watered claret and chatting until
                        night came on and Madame Roussillon brought in a lamp. Then he hurridly
                        snatched his cap from the floor beside him and got up to go.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come and look at my handiwork,&quot; Alice quickly said;
                        &quot;my shelf of pies, I mean.&quot; She led him to the pantry,
                        where a dozen or more of the cherry pts were ranged in order. &quot;I
                        made every one of them this morning and baked them; had them all out of the
                        oven <pb id="VAA2387-037" n="28"/> before the rain came up. Don&apos;t
                        you think me a wonder of cleverness and industry? Father Beret was polite
                        enough to flatter me; but youyou just eat what you want and say nothing! You
                        are not polite, Monsieur Ren de Ronville.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve been showing you what I thought of your
                        goodies,&quot; said Ren; &quot;eating&apos;s better than
                        talking, you know; so I&apos;ll just take one more,&quot; and he
                        helped himself. &quot;Isn&apos;t that compliment enough?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A few such would make me another hot day&apos;s work,&quot;
                        she replied, laughing. &quot;Pretty talk would be cheaper and more
                        satisfactory in the long run. Even the flour in these pts I ground with my
                        own hand in an Indian mortar. That was hard work too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>By this time Ren had forgotten the river house and the liquor. With softening
                        eyes he gazed at Alice&apos;s rounded cheeks and sheeny hair over which
                        the light from the curious earthen lamp she bore in her hand flickered most
                        effectively. He loved her madly; but his fear of her was more powerful than
                        his love. She gave him no opportunity to speak what he felt, having ever
                        ready a quick, bright change of mood and manner when she saw him plucking up
                        courage to address her in a sentimental way. Their relations had long been
                        somewhat familiar, which was but natural, considering their youth and the
                        circumstances of their daily life; but Alice somehow had kept a certain
                        distance open between them, so that very warm friendship could not suddenly
                        resolve itself into a troublesome passion on Ren&apos;s part.</p>
                    <p>We need not attempt to analyze a young girl&apos;s feeling <pb
                            id="VAA2387-038" n="29"/> and motives in such a case; what she does and
                        what she thinks are mysteries even to her own understanding. The influence
                        most potent in shaping the rudimentary character of Alice Tarleton (called
                        Roussillon) had been only such as a lonely frontier post could generate. Her
                        associations with men and women had, with few exceptions, been unprofitable
                        in an educational way, while her reading in M. Roussillon&apos;s little
                        library could not have given her any practical knowledge of manners and
                        life.</p>
                    <p>She was fond of Ren de Ronville, and it would have been quite in accordance
                        with the law of ordinary human forces, indeed almost the inevitable thing,
                        for her to love and marry him in the fullness of time; but her imagination
                        was outgrowing her surroundings. Books had given her a world of romance
                        wherein she moved at will, meeting a class of people far different from
                        those who actually shared her experiences. Her day-dreams and her
                        night-dreams partook much more of what she had read and imagined than of
                        what she had seen and heard in the raw little world around her.</p>
                    <p>Her affection for Ren was interfered with by her large admiration for the
                        heroic, masterful and magnetic knights who charged through the romances of
                        the Roussillon collection. For although Ren was unquestionably brave and
                        more than passably handsome, he had no armor, no war-horse, no shining lance
                        and embossed shieldthe difference, indeed, was great.</p>
                    <p>Those who love to contend against the fatal drift of our age toward
                        over-education could find in Alice Tarleton, foster daughter of Gaspard
                        Roussillon, a primitive <pb id="VAA2387-039" n="30"/> example, an elementary
                        case in point. What could her book education do but set up stumbling blocks
                        in the path of happiness? She was learning to prefer the ideal to the real.
                        Her soul was developing itself as best it could for the enjoyment of
                        conditions and things absolutely foreign to the possibilities of her lot in
                        life.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps it was the light and heat of imagination, shining out through
                        Alice&apos;s face, which gave her beauty such a fascinating power. Ren
                        saw it and felt its electrical stroke send a sweet shiver through his heart,
                        while he stood before her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are very beautiful to-night, Alice,&quot; he presently
                        said, with a suddenness which took even her alertness by surprise. A flush
                        rose to his dark face and immediately gave way to a grayish pallor. His
                        heart came near stopping on the instant, he was so shocked by his own
                        daring; but he laid a hand on her hair, stroking it softly.</p>
                    <p>Just a moment she was at a loss, looking a trifle embarrassed, then with a
                        merry laugh she stepped aside and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;That sounds better, Monsieur Ren de Ronville, much better; you will
                        be as polite as Father Beret after a little more training.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She slipped past him while speaking and made her way back again to the main
                        room, whence she called to him:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come here, I&apos;ve something to show you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He obeyed, a sheepish trace on his countenance betraying his
                        self-consciousness.</p>
                    <p>When he came near Alice she was taking from its <pb id="VAA2387-040" n="31"/>
                        buckhorn hook on the wall a rapier, one of a beautiful pair hanging side by
                        side.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Papa Roussillon gave me these,&quot; she said with great
                        animation. &quot;He bought them of an Indian who had kept them a long
                        time; where he came across them he would not tell; but look how beautiful!
                        Did you ever see anything so fine?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Guard and hilt were of silver; the blade, although somewhat corroded, still
                        showed the fine wavy lines of Damascus steel and traces of delicate
                        engraving, while in the end of the hilt was set a large oval turquoise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A very queer present to give a girl,&quot; said Ren;
                        &quot;what can you do with them?&quot;</p>
                    <p>A captivating flash of playfulness came into her face and she sprang
                        backward, giving the sword a semicircular turn with her wrist. The blade
                        sent forth a keen hiss as it cut the air close, very close to Ren&apos;s
                        nose. He jerked his head and flung up his hand.</p>
                    <p>She laughed merrily, standing beautifully poised before him, the
                        rapier&apos;s point slightly elevated. Her short skirt left her feet and
                        ankles free to show their graceful proportions and the perfect pose in which
                        they held her supple body.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You see what I can do with the <hi rend="i">colechemarde</hi>, eh,
                        Monsieur Ren de Ronville!&quot; she exclaimed, giving him a smile which
                        fairly blinded him. &quot;Notice how very near to your neck I can thrust
                        and yet not touch it. Now!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She darted the keen point under his chin and drew it away so quickly that the
                        stroke was like a glint of sunlight.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-041" n="32"/>
                    <p>&quot;What do you think of that as a nice and accurate piece of
                        skill?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She again resumed her pose, the right foot advanced, the left arm well back,
                        her lissome, finely developed body leaning slightly forward.</p>
                    <p>Ren&apos;s hands were up before his face in a defensive position, palms
                        outward.</p>
                    <p>Just then a chorus of men&apos;s voices sounded in the distance. The
                        river house was beginning its carousal with a song. Alice let fall her
                        sword&apos;s point and listened.</p>
                    <p>Ren looked about for his cap.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I must be going,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Another and louder swish of the rapier made him pirouette and dodge again
                        with great energy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t,&quot; he cried, &quot;that&apos;s
                        dangerous; you&apos;ll put out my eyes; I never saw such a
                        girl!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She laughed at him and kept on whipping the air dangerously near his eyes,
                        until she had driven him backward as far as he could squeeze himself into a
                        corner of the room.</p>
                    <p>Madame Roussillon came to the door from the kitchen and stood looking in and
                        laughing, with her hands on her hips. By this time the rapier was making a
                        criss-cross pattern of flashing lines close to the young man&apos;s head
                        while Alice, in the enjoyment of her exercise, seemed to concentrate all the
                        glowing rays of her beauty in her face, her eyes dancing merrily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Quit, now, Alice,&quot; he begged, half in fun and half in
                        abject fear; &quot;please quitI surrender!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She thrust to the wall on either side of him, then <pb id="VAA2387-042"
                            n="33"/> springing lightly backward a pace, stood at guard. Her thick
                        yellow hair had fallen over her neck and shoulders in a loose wavy mass, out
                        of which her face beamed with a bewitching effect upon her captive.</p>
                    <p>Ren, glad enough to have a cessation of his peril, stood laughing dryly; but
                        the singing down at the river house was swelling louder and he made another
                        movement to go.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You surrendered, you remember,&quot; cried Alice, Renewing the
                        sword-play; &quot;sit down on the chair there and make yourself
                        comfortable. You are not going down yonder to-night; you are going to stay
                        here and talk with me and Mother Roussillon; we are lonesome and you are
                        good company.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A shot rang out keen and clear; there was a sudden tumult that broke up the
                        distant singing; and presently more firing at varying intervals cut the
                        night air from the direction of the river.</p>
                    <p>Jean, the hunchback, came in to say that there was a row of some sort; he had
                        seen men running across the common as if in pursuit of a fugitive; but the
                        moonlight was so dim that he could not be sure what it all meant.</p>
                    <p>Ren picked up his cap and bolted out of the house.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE RAPE OF THE DEMIJOHN</head>
                    <p>The row down at the river house was more noise than fight, so far as results
                        seemed to indicate. It was all about a small <hi rend="i">dame jeanne</hi>
                        of fine brandy, which an Indian by the name of Long-Hair had seized and run
                        off with at the height of the carousal. He must have been soberer than his
                        pursuers, or naturally fleeter; for not one of them could catch him, or even
                        keep long in sight of him. Some pistols were emptied while the race was on,
                        and two or three of the men swore roundly to having seen Long-Hair jump
                        sidewise and stagger, as if one of the shots had taken effect. But, although
                        the moon was shining, he someway disappeared, they could not understand just
                        how, far down beside the river below the fort and the church.</p>
                    <p>It was not a very uncommon thing for an Indian to steal what he wanted, and
                        in most cases light punishment followed conviction; but it was felt to be a
                        capital offense for an Indian or anybody else to rape a demijohn of fine
                        brandy, especially one sent as a present, by a friend in New Orleans, to
                        Lieutenant Governor Abbott, who had until recently been the commandant of
                        the post. Every man at the river house ognized and resented the enormity of
                        Long-Hair&apos;s crime and each was, for the moment, ready to be his
                        judge and his executioner. He had broken at once every rule of frontier
                        etiquette and every bond of sympathy. <pb id="VAA2387-044" n="35"/> Nor was
                        Long-Hair ignorant of the danger involved in his daring enterprise. He had
                        beforehand carefully and stolidly weighed all the conditions, and true to
                        his Indian nature, had concluded that a little wicker covered bottle of
                        brandy was well worth the risk of his life. So he had put himself in
                        condition for a great race by slipping out and getting rid of his weapons
                        and all surplus weight of clothes.</p>
                    <p>This incident brought the drinking bout at the river house to a sudden end;
                        but nothing further came of it that night, and no record of it would be
                        found in these pages, but for the fact that Long-Hair afterwards became an
                        important character in the stirring historical drama which had old Vincennes
                        for its center of energy.</p>
                    <p>Ren de Ronville probably felt himself in bad luck when he arrived at the
                        river house just too late to share in the liquor or to join in chasing the
                        bold thief. He listened with interest, however, to the story of
                        Long-Hair&apos;s capture of the commandant&apos;s demijohn and could
                        not refrain from saying that if he had been present there would have been a
                        quite different result.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I would have shot him before he got to that door,&quot; he
                        said, drawing his heavy flint-lock pistol and going through the motions of
                        one aiming quickly and firing. Indeed, so vigorously in earnest was he with
                        the pantomime, that he actually did fire, unintentionally of course,the ball
                        burying itself in the door-jamb.</p>
                    <p>He was laughed at by those present for being more excited than they who
                        witnessed the whole thing. One of them, a leathery-faced and grizzled old
                        sinner, <pb id="VAA2387-045" n="36"/> leered at him contemptuously and said
                        in queer French, with a curious accent caught from long use of backwoods
                        English:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Listen how the boy brags! Ye might think, to hear Ren talk, that he
                        actually amounted to a pile.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This personage was known to every soul in Vincennes as Oncle Jazon, and when
                        Oncle Jazon spoke the whole town felt bound to listen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;An&apos; how well he shoots, too,&quot; he added with an
                        intolerable wink; &quot;aimed at the door and hit the post. Certainly
                        Long-Hair would have been in great danger! O yes, he&apos;d
                        &apos;ave killed Long-Hair at the first shot, wouldn&apos;t he
                        though!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon had the air of a large man, but the stature of a small one; in
                        fact he was shriveled bodily to a degree which suggested comparison with a
                        sundried wisp of hickory bark; and when he chuckled, as he was now doing,
                        his mouth puckered itself until it looked like a scar on his face. From cap
                        to moccasins he had every mark significant of a desperate character; and yet
                        there was about him something that instantly commanded the confidence of
                        rough men,the look of self-sufficiency and superior capability always to be
                        found in connection with immense will power. His sixty years of exposure,
                        hardship, and danger seemed to have but toughened his physique and
                        strengthened his vitality. Out of his small hazel eyes gleamed a light as
                        keen as ice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right, Oncle Jazon,&quot; said Ren laughing and blowing the
                        smoke out of his pistol; &quot; &apos;twas you all the <pb
                            id="VAA2387-046" n="37"/> same who let Long-Hair trot off with the
                        Governor&apos;s brandy, not I. If you could have hit even a door-post it
                        might have been better.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon took off his cap and looked down into it in a way he had when
                        about to say something final.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Ventrebleu!</hi> I did not shoot at Long-Hair at
                        all,&quot; he said, speaking slowly, &quot;because the scoundrel was
                        unarmed. He didn&apos;t have on even a knife, and he was havin&apos;
                        enough to do dodgin&apos; the bullets that the rest of &apos;em were
                        plumpin&apos; at &apos;im without any compliments from me to bother
                        &apos;im more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; Ren replied, turning away with a laugh,
                        &quot;if I&apos;d been scalped by the Indians, as you have, I
                        don&apos;t think there would be any particular reason why I should wait
                        for an Indian thief to go and arm himself before I accepted him as a
                        target.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon lifted a hand involuntarily and rubbed his scalpless crown; then
                        he chuckled with a grotesque grimace as if the recollection of having his
                        head skinned were the funniest thing imaginable.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When you&apos;ve killed as many of &apos;em as Oncle Jazon
                        has,&quot; remarked a bystander to Ren, &quot;you&apos;ll not be
                        so hungry for blood, maybe.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Especially after ye&apos;ve took fifty-nine scalps to pay for
                        yer one,&quot; added Oncle Jazon, replacing his cap over the hairless
                        area of his crown.</p>
                    <p>The men who had been chasing Long-Hair presently came straggling back with
                        their storieseach had a distinct oneof how the fugitive escaped. They were
                        wild looking fellows, most of them somewhat intoxicated, all profusely
                        liberal with their stock of picturesque <pb id="VAA2387-047" n="38"/>
                        profanity. They represented the roughest element of the well-nigh lawless
                        post.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m positive that he&apos;s wounded,&quot; said
                        one. &quot;Jacques and I shot at him together, so that our pistols
                        sounded just as if only one had been firedbang! that wayand he leaped
                        sideways for all the world like a bird with a broken leg. I thought
                        he&apos;d fall; but <hi rend="i">ve</hi>! he ran faster&apos;n ever,
                        and all at once he was gone; just disappeared.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, to-morrow we&apos;ll get him,&quot; said another.
                        &quot;You and I and Jacques, we&apos;ll take up his trail, the
                        thief, and follow him till we find him. He can&apos;t get off so
                        easy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know so well about that;&quot; said another;
                        &quot;it&apos;s Long-Hair, you must remember, and Long-Hair is no
                        common buck that just anybody can find asleep. You know what Long-Hair is.
                        Nobody&apos;s ever got even with &apos;im yet. That&apos;s so,
                        ain&apos;t it? Just ask Oncle Jazon, if you don&apos;t believe
                        it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The next morning Long-Hair was tracked to the river&apos;s edge. He had
                        been wounded, but whether seriously or not could only be conjectured. A
                        sprinkle of blood, here and there quite a dash of it, reddened the grass and
                        clumps of weeds he had run through, and ended close to the water into which
                        it looked as if he had plunged with a view to baffling pursuit. Indeed
                        pursuit was baffled. No further trace could be found, by which to follow the
                        cunning fugitive. Some of the men consoled themselves by saying, without
                        believing, that Long-Hair was probably lying drowned at the bottom of the
                        river.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-048" n="39"/>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Pas du tout</hi>,&quot; observed Oncle Jazon, his
                        short pipe askew far over in the corner of his mouth, &quot;not a bit of
                        it is that Indian drowned. He&apos;s jes&apos; as live as a fat cat
                        this minute, and as drunk as the devil. He&apos;ll get some o&apos;
                        yer scalps yet after he&apos;s guzzled all that brandy and
                        slep&apos; a week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It finally transpired that Oncle Jazon was partly right and partly wrong.
                        Long-Hair was alive, even as a fat cat, perhaps; but not drunk, for in
                        trying to swim with the rotund little <hi rend="i">dame jeanne</hi> under
                        his arm he lost hold of it and it went to the bottom of the Wabash, where it
                        may be lying at this moment patiently waiting for some one to fish it out of
                        its bed deep in the sand and mud, and break the ancient wax from its neck!</p>
                    <p>Ren de Ronville, after the chase of Long-Hair had been given over, went to
                        tell Father Beret what had happened, and finding the priest&apos;s hut
                        empty turned into the path leading to the Roussillon place, which was at the
                        head of a narrow street laid out in a direction at right angles to the
                        river&apos;s course. He passed two or three diminutive cabins, all as
                        much alike as bee-hives. Each had its squat veranda and thatched or
                        clapboarded roof held in place by weight-poles ranged in roughly parallel
                        rows, and each had the face of the wall under its veranda neatly daubed with
                        a grayish stucco made of mud and lime. You may see such houses today in some
                        remote parts of the creole country of Louisiana.</p>
                    <p>As Ren passed along he spoke with a gay French freedom to the dames and
                        lasses who chanced to be visible. His air would be regarded as violently
                        brigandish <pb id="VAA2387-049" n="40"/> in our day; we might even go so far
                        as to think his whole appearance comical. His jaunty cap with a tail that
                        wagged as he walked, his short trousers and leggins of buckskin, and his
                        loose shirt-like tunic, drawn in at the waist with a broad belt, gave his
                        strong figure just the dash of wildness suited to the armament with which it
                        was weighted. A heavy gun lay in the hollow of his shoulder under which hung
                        an otter-skin bullet-pouch with its clear powder-horn and white bone
                        charger. In his belt were two huge flint-lock pistols and a long case-knife.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Bon jour, Ma&apos;m&apos;selle
                        Adrienne</hi>,&quot; he cheerily called, waving his free hand in
                        greeting to a small, dark lass standing on the step of a veranda and
                        indolently swinging a broom. &quot;<hi rend="i">Comment alles-vous
                            aujourd&apos;hui?</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">J&apos;m&apos;porte trs bien, merci,
                            Mo&apos;sieu Ren</hi>,&quot; was the quick response;
                            &quot;<hi rend="i">et vous?</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;m as lively as a cricket.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Going a hunting?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, just up here a little wayjust on businessup to Mo&apos;sieu
                        Roussillon&apos;s for a moment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; the girl responded in a tone indicative of something
                        very like spleen, &quot;yes, undoubtedly, Mo&apos;sieu de Ronville;
                        your business there seems quite pressing of late. I have noticed your
                        industrious application to that business.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Ta-ta</hi>, little one,&quot; he wheedled,
                        lowering his voice; &quot;you mustn&apos;t go to making bug-bears
                        out of nothing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bug-bears!&quot; she retorted, &quot;you go on about your
                        business and I&apos;ll attend to mine,&quot; and she flirted into
                        the house.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-050" n="41"/>
                    <p>Ren laughed under his breath, standing a moment as if expecting her to come
                        out again; but she did not, and he resumed his walk singing softly</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;<hi rend="i">Elle a les joues vermeilles,

                    </lg>
                    <p>But ten to one he was not thinking of Madamoiselle Adrienne Bourcier. His
                        mind, however, must have been absorbingly occupied; for in the straight,
                        open way he met Father Beret and did not see him until he came near bumping
                        against the old man, who stepped aside with astonishing agility and said</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Dieu vous benisse, mon fils</hi>; but what is your
                        great hurrywhere can you be going in such happy haste?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ren did not stop to parley with the priest. He flung some phrase of pleasant
                        greeting back over his shoulder as he trudged on, his heart beginning a
                        tattoo against his ribs when the Roussillon place came in sight, and he took
                        hold of his mustache to pull it, as some men must do in moments of
                        nervousness and bashfulness. If sounds ever have color, the humming in his
                        ears was of a rosy hue; if thoughts ever exhale fragrance, his brain
                        overflowed with the sweets of violet and heliotrope.</p>
                    <p>He had in mind what he was going to say when Alice and he should be alone
                        together. It was a pretty speech, he thought; indeed a very thrilling little
                        speech, by the way it stirred his own nerve-centers as he conned it over.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-051" n="42"/>
                    <p>Madame Roussillon met him at the door in not a very good humor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is Mademoiselle Alice here?&quot; he ventured to demand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Alice? no, she&apos;s not here; she&apos;s never here just
                        I when I want her most. <hi rend="i">V&apos;la le picbois et la

                    <p>Madame Roussillon puffed audibly between phrases; but she suddenly became
                        very mild when relieved of her tirade.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Mais entrz</hi>,&quot; she added in a pleasant
                        tone, &quot;come in and tell me the news.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ren&apos;s disappointment rushed into his face, but he managed to laugh
                        it aside.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father Beret has just been telling me,&quot; said Madame
                        Roussillon, &quot;that our friend Long-Hair made some trouble last
                        night. How about it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ren told her what he knew and added that Long-Hair would probably never be
                        seen again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He was shot, no doubt of it,&quot; he went on, &quot;and is
                        now being nibbled by fish and turtles. We tracked him by his blood to where
                        he jumped into the Wabash. He never came out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Strangely enough it happened that, at the very time of this chat between
                        Madame Roussillon and Ren, <pb id="VAA2387-052" n="43"/> Alice was bandaging
                        Long-Hair&apos;s wounded leg with strips of her apron. It was under some
                        willows which overhung the bank of a narrow and shallow lagoon or slough,
                        which in those days extended a mile or two back into the country on the
                        farther side of the river. Alice and Jean went over in a pirogue to see if
                        the water lilies, haunting a pond there, were yet beginning to bloom. They
                        landed at a convenient spot some distance up the little lagoon, made the
                        boat fast by dragging its prow high ashore, and were on the point of setting
                        out across a neck of wet, grassy land to the pond, when a deep grunt, not
                        unlike that of a self-satisfied pig, attracted them to the willows, where
                        they discovered Long-Hair, badly wounded, weltering in some black mud.</p>
                    <p>His hiding-place was cunningly chosen, save that the mire troubled him,
                        letting him down by slow degrees, and threatening to engulf him bodily; and
                        he was now too weak to extricate himself. He lifted his head and glared. His
                        face was grimy, his hair matted with mud. Alice, although brave enough and
                        quite accustomed to startling experiences, uttered a cry when she saw those
                        snaky eyes glistening so savagely amid the shadows. But Jean was quick to
                        recognize Long-Hair; he had often seen him about town, a figure not to be
                        forgotten.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ve been hunting him everywhere,&quot; he said in
                        a half whisper to Alice, clutching the skirt of her dress.
                        &quot;It&apos;s Long-Hair, the Indian who stole the brandy; I know
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice recoiled a pace or two.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-053" n="44"/>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s go back and tell `em,&quot; Jean added, still
                        whispering, &quot;they want to kill him; Oncle Jazon said so. Come
                        on!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He gave her dress a jerk; but she did not move any farther back; she was
                        looking at the blood oozing from a wound in the Indian&apos;s leg.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is shot, he is hurt, Jean, we must help him,&quot;: she
                        presently said, recovering her self-control, yet still pale. &quot;We
                        must get him out of that bad place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jean caught Alice&apos;s merciful spirit with sympathetic readiness, and
                        showed immediate willingness to aid her.</p>
                    <p>It was a difficult thing to do; but there was a will and of course a way.
                        They had knives with which they cut willows to make a standing place on the
                        mud. While they were doing this they spoke friendly words to Long-Hair, who
                        understood French a little, and at last they got hold of his arms, tugged,
                        rested, tugged again, and finally managed to help him to a dry place, still
                        under the willows, where he could lie more at ease. Jean carried water in
                        his cap with which they washed the wound and the stolid savage face. Then
                        Alice tore up her cotton apron, in which she had hoped to bear home a load
                        of lilies, and with the strips bound the wound very neatly. It took a long
                        time, during which the Indian remained silent and apparently quite
                        indifferent.</p>
                    <p>Long-Hair was a man of superior physique, tall, straight, with the muscles of
                        a Vulcan; and while he lay stretched on the ground half clad and motionless,
                        he would have been a grand model for an heroic figure <pb id="VAA2387-054"
                            n="[]"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2387-3">

                        <pb id="VAA2387-055" n="45"/> in bronze. Yet from every lineament there came
                        a strange repelling influence, like that from a snake. Alice felt almost
                        unbearable disgust while doing her merciful task; but she bravely persevered
                        until it was finished.</p>
                    <p>It was now late in the afternoon, and the sun would be setting before they
                        could reach home.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We must hurry back, Jean,&quot; Alice said, turning to depart.
                        &quot;It will be all we can do to reach the other side in daylight.
                        I&apos;m thinking that they&apos;ll be out hunting for us too, if we
                        don&apos;t move right lively. Come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She gave the Indian another glance when she had taken but a step. He grunted
                        and held up something in his handsomething that shone with a dull yellow
                        light. It was a small, oval, gold locket which she had always worn in her
                        bosom. She sprang and snatched it from his palm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she exclaimed, smiling gratefully. &quot;I
                        am so glad you found it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The chain by which the locket had hung was broken, doubtless by some movement
                        while dragging Long-Hair out of the mud, and the lid had sprung open,
                        exposing a miniature portrait of Alice, painted when she was a little child,
                        probably not two years old. It was a sweet baby face, archly bright, almost
                        surrounded with a fluff of golden hair. The neck and the upper line of the
                        plump shoulders, with a trace of richly delicate lace and a string of
                        pearls, gave somehow a suggestion of patrician daintiness.</p>
                    <p>Long-Hair looked keenly into Alice&apos;s eyes, when <pb id="VAA2387-056"
                            n="46"/> she stooped to take the locket from his hand, but said nothing.</p>
                    <p>She and Jean now hurried away, and, so vigorously did they paddle the
                        pirogue, that the sky was yet red in the west when they reached home and
                        duly received their expected scolding from Madame Roussillon.</p>
                    <p>Alice sealed Jean&apos;s lips as to their adventure; for she had made up
                        her mind to save Long-Hair if possible, and she felt sure that the only way
                        to do it would be to trust no one but Father Beret.</p>
                    <p>It turned out that Long-Hair&apos;s wound was neither a broken bone nor a
                        cut artery. The flesh of his leg, midway between the hip and the knee, was
                        pierced; the bullet had bored a neat hole clean through. Father Beret took
                        the case in hand, and with no little surgical skill proceeded to set the big
                        Indian upon his feet again. The affair had to be cleverly managed. Food,
                        medicines and clothing were surreptitiously borne across the river; a bed of
                        grass was kept fresh under Long-Hair&apos;s back; his wound was
                        regularly dressed; and finally his weaponsa tomahawk, a knife, a strong bow
                        and a quiver of arrowswhich he had hidden on the night of his bold theft,
                        were brought to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now go and sin no more,&quot; said good Father Beret; but he
                        well knew that his words were mere puffs ot articulate wind in the ear of
                        the grim and silent savage, who limped away with an air of stately dignity
                        into the wilderness.</p>
                    <p>A load fell from Alice&apos;s mind when Father Beret informed her of
                        Long-Hair&apos;s recovery and departure. Day and night the dread lest
                        some of the men should <pb id="VAA2387-057" n="47"/> find out his
                        hiding-place and kill him had depressed and worried her. And now, when it
                        was all over, there still hovered like an elusive shadow in her
                        consciousness a vague haunting impression of the incident&apos;s immense
                        significance as an influence in her life. To feel that she had saved a man
                        from death was a new sensation of itself; but the man and the circumstances
                        were picturesque; they invited imagination; they furnished an atmosphere of
                        romance dear to all young and healthy natures, and somehow stirred her soul
                        with a strange appeal.</p>
                    <p>Long-Hair&apos;s imperturbable calmness, his stolid, immobile
                        countenance, the mysterious reptilian gleam of his shifty black eyes, and
                        the soulless expression always lurking in them, kept a fascinating hold on
                        the girl&apos;s memory. They blended curiously with the impressions left
                        by the romances she had read in M. Roussillon&apos;s mildewed books.</p>
                    <p>Long-Hair was not a young man; but it would have been impossible to guess
                        near his age. His form and face simply showed long experience and
                        immeasurable vigor. Alice remembered with a shuddering sensation the look he
                        gave her when she took the locket from his hand. It was of but a
                        second&apos;s duration, yet it seemed to search every nook of her being
                        with its subtle power.</p>
                    <p>Romancers have made much of their Indian heroes, picturing them as models of
                        manly beauty and nobility; but all fiction must be taken with liberal
                        pinches of salt. The plain truth is that dark savages of the pure blood
                        often do possess the magnetism of perfect physical <pb id="VAA2387-058"
                            n="48"/> development and unfathomable mental strangeness; but real
                        beauty they never have. Their innate repulsiveness is so great that, like
                        the snake&apos;s charm, it may fascinate; yet an indescribable, haunting
                        disgust goes with it. And, after all, if Alice had been asked to tell just
                        how she felt toward the Indian she had labored so hard to save, she would
                        promptly have said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I loathe him as I do a toad!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Nor would Father Beret, put to the same test, have made a substantially
                        different confession. His work, to do which his life went as fuel to fire,
                        was training the souls of Indians for the reception of divine grace; but
                        experience had not changed his first impression of savage character. When he
                        traveled in the wilderness he carried the Word and the Cross; but he was
                        also armed with a gun and two good pistols, not to mention a dangerous
                        knife. The rumor prevailed that Father Beret could drive a nail at sixty
                        yards with his rifle, and at twenty snuff a candle with either one of his
                        pistols.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE FIRST MAYOR OF VINCENNES</head>
                    <p>Governor Abbott probably never so much as heard of the <hi rend="i">dame
                            jeanne</hi> of French brandy sent to him by his creole friend in New
                        Orleans. He had been gone from Vincennes several months when the batteau
                        arrived, having been recalled to Detroit by the British authorities; and he
                        never returned. Meantime the little post with its quaint cabins and its
                        dilapidated blockhouse, called Fort Sackville, lay sunning drowsily by the
                        river in a blissful state of helplessness from the military point of view.
                        There was no garrison; the two or three pieces of artillery, abandoned and
                        exposed, gathered rust and cobwebs, while the pickets of the stockade,
                        decaying and loosened in the ground by winter freezes and summer rains,
                        leaned in all directions, a picture of decay and inefficiency.</p>
                    <p>The inhabitants of the town, numbering about six hundred, lived very much as
                        pleased them, without any regular municipal government, each family its own
                        tribe, each man a law unto himself; yet for mutual protection, they all kept
                        in touch and had certain common rights which were religiously respected and
                        defended faithfully. A large pasturing ground was fenced in where the goats
                        and little black cows of the villagers browsed as one herd, while the
                        patches of wheat, corn and vegetables were not inclosed at all. A few of the
                        thriftier and more important citizens, <pb id="VAA2387-060" n="50"/>
                        however, had separate estates of some magnitude, surrounding their
                        residences, kept up with care and, if the time and place be taken into
                        account, with considerable show of taste.</p>
                    <p>Monsieur Gaspard Roussillon was looked upon as the aristocrat <hi rend="i"
                            >par excellence</hi> of Vincennes, notwithstanding the fact that his
                        name bore no suggestion of noble or titled ancestry. He was rich and in a
                        measure educated; moreover the successful man&apos;s patent of
                        leadership, a commanding figure and a suave manner, came always to his
                        assistance when a crisis presented itself. He traded shrewdly, much to his
                        own profit, but invariably with the excellent result that the man, white or
                        Indian, with whom he did business felt himself especially favored in the
                        transaction. By the exercise of firmness, prudence, vast assumption, florid
                        eloquence and a kindly liberality he had greatly endeared himself to the
                        people; so that in the absence of a military commander he came naturally to
                        be regarded as the chief of the town, <hi rend="i"
                            >Mo&apos;sieu&apos; le maire.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>He returned from his extended trading expedition about the middle of July,
                        bringing, as was his invariable rule, a gift for Alice. This time it was a
                        small, thin disc of white flint, with a hole in the center through which a
                        beaded cord of sinew was looped. The edge of the disc was beautifully
                        notched and the whole surface polished so that it shone like glass, while
                        the beads, made of very small segments of porcupine quills, were variously
                        dyed, making a curiously gaudy show of bright colors.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There now, <hi rend="i">ma cherie</hi>, is something worth fifty
                            <pb id="VAA2387-061" n="51"/> times its weight in gold,&quot; said
                        M. Roussillon when he presented the necklace to his foster daughter with
                        pardonable self-satisfaction. &quot;It is a sacred charm-string given me
                        by an old heathen who would sell his soul for a pint of cheap rum. He
                        solemnly informed me that whoever wore it could not by any possibility be
                        killed by an enemy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice kissed M. Roussillon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s so curious and beautiful,&quot; she said, holding
                        it up and drawing the variegated string through her fingers. Then, with her
                        mischievous laugh; she added; &quot;and I&apos;m glad it is so
                        powerful against one&apos;s enemy; I&apos;ll wear it whenever I go
                        where Adrienne Bourcier is, see if I don&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is she your enemy? What&apos;s up between you and la petite
                        Adrienne, eh?&quot; M. Roussillon lightly demanded. &quot;You were
                        always the best of good friends, I thought. What&apos;s
                        happened?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, we are good friends,&quot; said Alice, quickly,
                        &quot;very good friends, indeed; I was but chaffing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good friends, but enemies; that&apos;s how it is with women.
                        Who&apos;s the young man that&apos;s caused the coolness? I could
                        guess, maybe!&quot; He laughed and winked knowingly. &quot;May I be
                        so bold as to name him at a venture?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, if you&apos;ll be sure to mention Monsieur Ren de
                        Ronville,&quot; she gayly answered. &quot;Who but he could work
                        Adrienne up into a perfect green mist of jealousy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He would need an accomplice, I should imagine; a <pb
                            id="VAA2387-062" n="52"/> young lady of some beauty and a good deal of
                        heart-lessness.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Like whom, for example?&quot; and she tossed her bright head.
                        &quot;Not me, I am sure.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Poh! like every pretty maiden in the whole world, <hi rend="i">ma
                            petite coquette</hi>; they&apos;re all alike as peas, cruel as blue
                        jays and as sweet as apple-blossoms.&quot; He stroked her hair clumsily
                        with his large hand, as a heavy and roughly fond man is apt to do, adding in
                        an almost serious tone:</p>
                    <p>&quot;But my little girl is better than most of them, not a foolish
                        mischief-maker, I hope.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice was putting her head through the string of beads and letting the
                        translucent white disc fall into her bosom.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s time to change the subject,&quot; she said;
                        &quot;tell me what you have seen while away. I wish I could go far off
                        and see things. Have you been to Detroit, Quebec, Montreal?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I&apos;ve been to all, a long, hard journey, but
                        reasonably profitable. You shall have a goodly dot when you get married, my
                        child.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And did you attend any parties and balls?&quot; she inquired
                        quickly, ignoring his concluding remark. &quot;Tell me about them. How
                        do the fine ladies dress, and do they wear their hair high with great big
                        combs? Do they have long skirts and&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold up, you double-tongued chatterbox!&quot; he interrupted;
                        &quot;I can&apos;t answer forty questions at once. Yes, I danced
                        till my legs ached with women old and girls young; but how could I remember
                        how they were <pb id="VAA2387-063" n="53"/> dressed and what their style of
                        coiffure was? I know that silk rustled and there was a perfume of <hi
                            rend="i">eau de Cologne</hi> and mignonette and my heart expanded and
                        blazed while I whirled like a top with a sweet lady in my arms.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you must have cut a ravishing figure!&quot; interpolated
                        Madame Roussillon with emphatic disapproval, her eyes snapping. &quot;A
                        bull in a lace shop. How delighted the ladies must have been!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never saw such blushing faces and burning glancessuch fluttering
                        breasts, such&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Big braggart,&quot; Madame Roussillon broke in contemptuously,
                        &quot;it&apos;s a piastre to a sou that you stood gawping in through
                        a window while gentlemen and ladies did the dancing. I can imagine how you
                        lookedI can!&quot; and with this she took her prodigious bulk at a
                        waddling gait out of the room. &quot;I remember how you danced even when
                        you were not clumsy as a pig on ice!&quot; she shrieked back over her
                        shoulder.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Parbleu!</hi> true enough, my dear,&quot; he
                        called after her, &quot;I should think you couldyou mind how we used to
                        trip it together. You were the prettiest dancer of them all, and the young
                        fellows all went to the swords about you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But tell me more,&quot; Alice insisted; &quot;I want to
                        know all about what you saw in the great townsin the fine houseshow the
                        ladies looked, how they actedwhat they saidthe dresses they
                        worehow&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ciel! you will split my ears, child; can&apos;t you fill my
                        pipe and bring it to me with a coal on it? Then I&apos;ll try to tell
                        you what I can,&quot; he cried, assuming a <pb id="VAA2387-064" n="54"/>
                        humorously resigned air. &quot;Perhaps if I smoke I can remember
                        everything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice gladly ran to do what he asked. Meantime Jean was out on the gallery
                        blowing a flute that M. Roussillon had brought him from Quebec.</p>
                    <p>The pipe well filled and lighted apparently did have the effect to steady and
                        encourage M. Roussillon&apos;s memory; or if not his memory, then his
                        imagination, which, was of that fervid and liberal sort common to natives of
                        the Midi, and which has been exquisitely depicted by the late Alphonse
                        Daudet in Tartarin and Bompard. He leaned far back in a strong chair, with
                        his massive legs stretched at full length, and gazed at the roof-poles while
                        he talked.</p>
                    <p>He sympathized fully, in his crude way, with Alice&apos;s lively
                        curiosity, and his affection for her made him anxious to appease her longing
                        after news from the great outside world. If the sheer truth must come out,
                        however, he knew precious little about that world, especially the polite
                        part of it in which thrived those femininities so dear to the heart of an
                        isolated and imaginative girl. Still, as he, too, lived in Arcadia, there
                        was no great effort involved when he undertook to blow a dreamer&apos;s
                        flute.</p>
                    <p>In the first place he had not been in Quebec or Montreal during his absence
                        from home. Most of the time he had spent disposing of pelts and furs at
                        Detroit and in extending his trading relations with other posts; but what
                        mattered a trifling want of facts when his meridional fancy once began to
                        warm up? A smattering of social knowledge, gained at first hand in his
                        youthful <pb id="VAA2387-065" n="55"/> days in France while he was a student
                        whose parents fondly expected him to conquer the world, came to his aid, and
                        besides he had saturated himself all his life with poetry and romance.
                        Scudry, Scarron, Prvost, Madame La Fayette and Calprnde were the chief
                        sources of his information touching the life and manners, morals and
                        gayeties of people who, as he supposed, stirred the surface of that
                        resplendent and far-off ocean called society. Nothing suited him better than
                        to smoke a pipe and talk about what he had seen and done; and the less he
                        had really seen and done the more he had to tell.</p>
                    <p>His broad, almost over-virile, kindly and contented face beamed with the
                        warmth of wholly imaginary recollections while he recounted with minute
                        circumstantiality to the delighted Alice his gallant adventures in the
                        crowded and brilliant ball-rooms of the French-Canadian towns. The rolling
                        burr of his bass voice, deep and resonant, gave force to the improvised
                        descriptions.</p>
                    <p>Madame Roussillon heard the heavy booming and presently came softly back into
                        the door from the kitchen to listen. She leaned against the facing in an
                        attitude of ponderous attention, a hand on her bulging hip. She could not
                        suppress her unbounded admiration of her liege lord&apos;s manly
                        physique, and jealous to fierceness as she was of his experiences so
                        eloquently and picturesquely related, her woman&apos;s nature took fire
                        with enjoyment of the scenes described.</p>
                    <p>This is the mission of the poet and the romancerto sponge out of existence,
                        for a time, the stiff, refractory, <pb id="VAA2387-066" n="56"/> and
                        unlovely realities and give in their place a scene of ideal mobility and
                        charm. The two women reveled in Gaspard Roussillon&apos;s revelations.
                        They saw the brilliant companies, the luxurious surroundings, heard the
                        rustle of brocade and the fine flutter of laces, the hum of sweet voices,
                        breathed in the wafts of costly perfumeries, looked on while the dancers
                        whirled and flickered in the confusion of lights; and over all and through
                        all poured and vibrated such ravishing music as only the southern
                        imagination could have conjured up out of nothing.</p>
                    <p>Alice was absolutely charmed. She sat on a low wooden stool and gazed into
                        Gaspard Roussillon&apos;s face with dilating eyes in which burned that
                        rich and radiant something we call a passionate soul. She drank in his
                        flamboyant stream of words with a thirst which nothing but experience could
                        ever quench. He felt her silent applause and the admiring involuntary
                        absorption that possessed his wife; the consciousness of his elementary
                        magnetism augmented the flow of his fine descriptions, and he went on and
                        on, until the arrival of Father Beret put an end to it all.</p>
                    <p>The priest, hearing of M. Roussillon&apos;s return, had come to inquire
                        about some friends living at Detroit. He took luncheon with the family,
                        enjoying the down right refreshing collation of broiled birds, onions,
                        meal-cakes and claret, ending with a dish of blackberries and cream.</p>
                    <p>M. Roussillon seized the first opportunity to resume his successful
                        romancing, and presently in the midst <pb id="VAA2387-067" n="57"/> of the
                        meal began to tell Father Beret about what he had seen in Quebec.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By the way,&quot; he said, with expansive casualness in his
                        voice, &quot;I called upon your old-time friend and coadjutor, Father
                        Sebastien, while up there. A noble old man. He sent you a thousand good
                        messages. Was mightily delighted when I told him how happy and hale you have
                        always been here. Ah, you should have seen his dear old eyes full of loving
                        tears. He would walk a hundred miles to see you, he said, but never expected
                        to in this world. Blessings, blessings upon dear Father Beret, was what he
                        murmured in my ear when we were parting. He says that he will never leave
                        Quebec until he goes to his home aboveah!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The way in which M. Roussillon closed his little speech, his large eyes
                        upturned, his huge hands clasped in front of him, was very effective.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am under many obligations, my son,&quot; said Father Beret,
                        &quot;for what you tell me. It was good of you to remember my dear old
                        friend and go to him for his loving messages to me. I am very, very
                        thankful. Help me to another drop of wine, please.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Now the extraordinary feature of the situation was that Father Beret had
                        known positively for nearly five years that Father Sebastien was dead and
                        buried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; M. Roussillon continued, pouring the claret with
                        one hand and making a pious gesture with the other; &quot;the dear old
                        man loves you and prays for you; his voice quavers whenever he speaks of
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Doubtless he made his old joke to you about the <pb
                            id="VAA2387-068" n="58"/> birth-mark on my shoulder,&quot; said
                        Father Beret after a moment of apparently thoughtful silence. &quot;He
                        may have said something about it in a playful way, eh?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;True, true, why yes, he surely mentioned the same,&quot;
                        assented M. Roussillon, his face assuming an expression of confused memory;
                        &quot;it was something sly and humorous, I mind; but it just escapes my
                        recollection. A right jolly old boy is Father Sebastien; indeed very amusing
                        at times.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;At times, yes,&quot; said Father Beret, who had no birth-mark
                        on his shoulder, and had never had one there, or on any other part of his
                        person.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How strange!&quot; Alice remarked, &quot;I, too, have a
                        mark on my shouldera pink spot, just like a small, five-petaled flower. We
                        must be of kin to each other, Father Beret.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The priest laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If our marks are alike, that would be some evidence of
                        kinship,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But what shape is yours, Father?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve never seen it,&quot; he responded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never seen it! Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it&apos;s absolutely invisible,&quot; and he chuckled
                        heartily, meantime glancing shrewdly at M. Roussillon out of the tail of his
                        eye.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s on the back part of his shoulder,&quot; quickly
                        spoke up M. Roussillon, &quot;and you know priests never use
                        looking-glasses. The mark is quite invisible therefore, so far as Father
                        Beret is concerned!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You never told me of your birth-mark before, ray
                        daughter,&quot; said Father Beret, turning to Alice with <pb
                            id="VAA2387-069" n="59"/> sudden interest. &quot;It may some day be
                        good fortune to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why so, Father?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If your family name is really Tarleton, as you suppose from the
                        inscription on your locket, the birthmark, being of such singular shape,
                        would probably identify you. It is said that these marks run regularly in
                        families. With the miniature and the distinguishing birth-mark you have
                        enough to make a strong case should you once find the right Tarleton
                        family.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You talk as they write in novels,&quot; said Alice.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve read about just such things in them.
                        Wouldn&apos;t it be grand if I should turn out to be some great
                        personage in disguise!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The mention of novels reminded Father Beret of that terrible book, <hi
                            rend="i">Manon Lescaut</hi>, which he last saw in Alice&apos;s
                        possession, and he could not refrain from mentioning it in a voice that
                        shuddered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rest easy, Father Beret,&quot; said Alice; &quot;that is
                        one novel I have found wholly distasteful to me. I tried to read it, but
                        could not do it. I flung it aside in utter disgust. You and mother
                        Roussillon are welcome to hide it deep as a well, for all I care. I
                        don&apos;t enjoy reading about low, vile people and hopeless
                        unfortunates; I like sweet and lovely heroines and strong, high-souled,
                        brave heroes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Read about the blessed saints, then, my daughter; you will find in
                        them the true heroes and heroines of this world,&quot; said Father
                        Beret.</p>
                    <p>M. Roussillon changed the subject, for he always somehow dreaded to have the
                        good priest fall into the <pb id="VAA2387-070" n="60"/> strain of argument
                        he was about to begin. A stray sheep, no matter how refractory, feels a
                        touch of longing when it hears the shepherd&apos;s voice. M. Roussillon
                        was a Catholic, but a straying one, who avoided the confessional and often
                        forgot mass. Still, with all his reckless independence, and with all his
                        outward show of large and breezy self-sufficiency, he was not altogether
                        free from the hold, that the church had laid upon him in childhood and
                        youth. Moreover, he was fond of Father Beret and had done a great deal for
                        the little church of St. Xavier and the mission it represented; but he
                        distinctly desired to be let alone while he pursued his own course; and he
                        had promised the dying woman who gave Alice to him that the child should be
                        left as she was, a Protestant, without undue influence to change her from
                        the faith of her parents. This promise he had kept with stubborn persistence
                        and he meant to keep it as long as he lived. Perhaps the very fact that his
                        innermost conscience smote him with vague yet telling blows at times for
                        this departure from the strict religion of his fathers, may have intensified
                        his resistance of the influence constantly exerted upon Alice by Father
                        Beret and Madame Roussillon, to bring her gently but surely to the church.
                        Perverseness is a force to be reckoned with in all original characters.</p>
                    <p>A few weeks had passed after M. Roussillon&apos;s return, when that
                        big-hearted man took it into his head to celebrate his successful trading
                        ventures with a moonlight dance given without reserve to all the inhabitants
                        of Vincennes. It was certainly a democratic <pb id="VAA2387-071" n="61"/>
                        function that he contemplated, and motley to a most picturesque extent.</p>
                    <p>Ren de Ronville called upon Alice a day or two previous to the occasion and
                        duly engaged her as his <hi rend="i">partenaire</hi>; but she insisted upon
                        having the engagement guarded in her behalf by a condition so obviously
                        fanciful that he accepted it without argument.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If my wandering knight should arrive during the dance, you promise
                        to stand aside and give place to him,&quot; she stipulated.
                        &quot;You promise that? You see I&apos;m expecting him all the time.
                        I dreamed last night that he came on a great bay horse and, stooping,
                        whirled me up behind the saddle, and away we went!&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was a childish, half bantering air in her look; but her voice sounded
                        earnest and serious, notwithstanding its delicious <hi rend="i">timbre</hi>
                        of suppressed playfulness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You promise me?&quot; she insisted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I promise to slink away into a corner and chew my thumb, the
                        moment he comes,&quot; Ren eagerly assented. &quot;Of course
                        I&apos;m taking a great risk, I know; for lords and barons and knights
                        are very apt to appear suddenly in a place like this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You may banter and make light if you want to,&quot; she said,
                        pouting admirably. &quot;I don&apos;t care. All the same the laugh
                        will jump to the other corner of your mouth, see if it doesn&apos;t.
                        They say that what a person dreams about and wishes for and waits for and
                        believes in, will come true sooner or later.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If that&apos;s so,&quot; said Ren, &quot;you and I will
                        get married; for I&apos;ve dreamed it every night of the year, wished
                        for it, waited for it and believed in it, and&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-072" n="62"/>
                    <p>It was a madly sudden rush. He made it on an impulse quite irresistible, as
                        hypnotized persons are said to do in response to the suggestion of the
                        hypnotists, and his heart was choking his throat before he could end his
                        speech. Alice interrupted him with a hearty burst of laughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A very pretty twist you give to my words, I must declare,&quot;
                        she said; &quot;but not new by any means. Little Adrienne Bourcier could
                        tell you that. She says that you have vowed to her over and over that you
                        dream about her, and wish for her, and wait for her, precisely as you have
                        just said to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ren&apos;s brown face flushed to the <unclear>--mples</unclear>, partly
                        with anger, partly with the shock of mingled surprise and fear. He was
                        guilty, and the guilt showed in his eyes and paralyzed his tongue, so that
                        he sat there before Alice with his under jaw sagging ludicrously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you rather think, Monsieur Ren de
                        Ronville,&quot; she presently added in a calmly advisory tone,
                        &quot;that you had better quit trying to say&quot; such foolish
                        things to me, and just be my very good friend? If you don&apos;t, I do,
                        which comes to the same thing. What&apos;s more, I won&apos;t be
                        your partenaire at the dance unless you promise me on your word of honor
                        that you will dance two dances with Adrienne to every one that you have with
                        me. Do you promise?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He dared not oppose her outwardly, although in his heart resistance amounted
                        to furious revolt and riot.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I promise anything you ask me to,&quot; he said resignedly,
                        almost sullenly; &quot;anything for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I ask nothing whatever on my own account,&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA2387-073" n="63"/> Alice quickly replied; &quot;but I do tell
                        you firmly that you shall not maltreat little Adrienne Boucier and remain a
                        friend of mine. She loves you, Ren de Ronville, and you have told her that
                        you love her. If you are a man worthy of respect you will not desert her.
                        Don&apos;t you think I am right?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Like a singed and crippled moth vainly trying to rise once again to the
                        alluring yet deadly flame, Ren de Ronville essayed to break out of his
                        embarrassment and resume equal footing with the girl so suddenly become his
                        commanding superior; but the effort disclosed to him as well as to her that
                        he had fallen to rise no <unclear>m---.</unclear> In his abject defeat he
                        accepted the terms dictated by Alice and was glad when she adroitly changed
                        her manner and tone in going on to discuss the approaching dance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now let me make one request of you,&quot; he demanded after a
                        while. &quot;It&apos;s a small favor; may I ask it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but I don&apos;t <unclear>g-ant</unclear> it in
                        advance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want you to wear, for my sake, the buff gown which they say was
                        your grandmother&apos;s.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I won&apos;t wear it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But why, Alice?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;None of the other girls have anything like such a dress; it would
                        not be right for me to put it on and make them all feel that I had taken the
                        advantage of them, just because I could; that&apos;s why.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But then none of them is beautiful and educated like you,&quot;
                        he said; &quot;you&apos;ll outshine them anyway.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Save your compliments for poor pretty little <pb id="VAA2387-074"
                            n="64"/> Adrienne,&quot; she firmly responded, &quot;I
                        positively do not wish to hear them. I have agreed to be your partenaire at
                        this dance of Papa Roussillon&apos;s, but it is understood between us
                        that Adrienne is your sweet-heart. I am not, and I&apos;m not going to
                        be, either. So for your sake and Adrienne&apos;s, as well as out of
                        consideration for the rest of the girls who have no fine dresses, I am not
                        going to wear the buff brocade gown that belonged to Papa
                        Roussillon&apos;s mother long ago. I shall dress just as the rest
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It is safe to say that Ren de Ronville went hom with a troublesome bee in his
                        bonnet. He was not a bad-hearted fellow. Many a right good young man, before
                        him and since, has loved an Adrienne and been dazzled by an Alice. A violet
                        is sweet, but a rose is the garden&apos;s queen. The poor youthful
                        frontiersman ought to have been stronger; but he was not, and what have we
                        to say?</p>
                    <p>As for Alice, since having a confidential talk with Adrienne Bourcier
                        recently, she had come to realize what M. Roussillon meant when he said:
                        &quot;But my little girl is better than most of them, not a foolish
                        mischief-maker, I hope.&quot; She saw through the situation with a quick
                        understanding of what Adrienne might suffer should Ren prove permanently
                        fickle. The thought of it aroused all her natural honesty and serious
                        nobleness of character, which lay deep under the almost hoydenish levity
                        usually observable in her manner. Crude as her sense of life&apos;s
                        larger significance was, and meager as had been her experience in the things
                        which count for most in the sum of a young <pb id="VAA2387-075" n="65"/>
                        girl&apos;s existence under fair circumstances, she grasped intuitively
                        the gist of it all.</p>
                    <p>The dance did not come off; it had to be postponed indefinitely on account of
                        a grave change in the political relations of the little post. A day or two
                        before the time set for that function a rumor ran through the town that
                        something of importance was about to happen. Father Gibault, at the head of
                        a small party, had arrived from Kaskaskia, far away on the Mississippi, with
                        the news that France and the American Colonies had made common cause against
                        the English in the great war of which the people of Vincennes neither knew
                        the cause nor cared a straw about the outcome.</p>
                    <p>It was Oncle Jazon who came to the Roussillon place to tell M. Roussillon
                        that he was wanted at the river house. Alice met him at the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come in, Oncle Jazon,&quot; she cheerily said, &quot;you
                        are getting to be a stranger at our house lately. Come in; what news do you
                        bring? Take off your cap and rest your hair, Oncle Jazon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The scalpless old fighter chuckled raucously and bowed to the best of his
                        ability. He not only took off his queer cap, but looked into it with a
                        startled gaze, as if he expected something infinitely dangerous to jump out
                        and seize his nose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A thousand thanks, Ma&apos;m&apos;selle,&quot; he
                        presently said, &quot;will ye please tell Mo&apos;sieu&apos;
                        Roussillon that I would wish to see &apos;im?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, Oncle Jazon; but first be seated, and let me offer you just a
                        drop of <hi rend="i">eau de vie</hi>; some that Papa <pb id="VAA2387-076"
                            n="66"/> Roussillon brought back with him from Quebec. He says
                        it&apos;s old and fine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She poured him a full glass, then setting the bottle on a little stand, went
                        to find M. Roussillon. While she was absent Oncle Jazon improved his
                        opportunity to the fullest extent. At least three additional glasses of the
                        brandy went the way of the first. He grinned atrociously and smacked his
                        corrugated lips; but when Gaspard Roussillon came in, the old man was
                        sitting at some distance from the bottle and glass gazing indifferently out
                        across the veranda. He told his story curtly. Father Gibault, he said, had
                        sent him to ask M. Roussillon to come to the river house, as he had news of
                        great importance to communicate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, well, Oncle Jazon, we&apos;ll have a nip of brandy together
                        before we go,&quot; said the host.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, yes, jes&apos; one agin&apos; the broilin&apos;
                        weather,&quot; assented Oncle Jazon; &quot;I don&apos;t mind
                        jes&apos; one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A very rich friend of mine in Quebec gave me this brandy, Oncle
                        Jazon,&quot; said M. Roussillon, pouring the liquor with a grand
                        flourish; &quot;and I thought of you as soon as I got it. Now, says I to
                        myself, if any man knows good brandy when he tastes it, it&apos;s Oncle
                        Jazon, and I&apos;ll give him a good chance at this bottle just the
                        first of all my friends.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It surely is delicious,&quot; said Oncle Jazon, &quot;very
                        delicious.&quot; He spoke French with a curious accent, having spent
                        long years with English-speaking frontiersmen in the Carolinas and Kentucky,
                        so that their lingo had become his own.</p>
                    <p>As they walked side by side down the way to the <pb id="VAA2387-077" n="67"/>
                        river house they looked like typical extremes of rough, sun-burned and
                        weather-tanned manhood; Oncle Jazon a wizened, diminutive scrap, wrinkled
                        and odd in every respect; Gaspard Roussillon towering six feet two, wide
                        shouldered, massive, lumbering, muscular, a giant with long curling hair and
                        a superb beard. They did not know that they were going down to help dedicate
                        the great Northwest to freedom.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">FATHER GIBAULT.</head>
                    <p>Great movements in the affairs of men are like tides of the seas which reach
                        and affect the remotest and quietest nooks and inlets, imparting a thrill
                        and a swell of the general motion. Father Gibault brought the wave of the
                        American Revolution to Vincennes. He was a simple missionary; but he was,
                        besides, a man of great worldly knowledge and personal force. Colonel George
                        Rogers Clark made Father Gibault&apos;s acquaintance at Kaskaskia, when
                        the fort and its garrison surrendered to his command, and, quickly
                        discerning the fine qualities of the priest&apos;s character, sent him
                        to the post on the Wabash to win over its people to the cause of freedom and
                        independence. Nor was the task assumed a hard one, as Father Gibault
                        probably well knew before he undertook it.</p>
                    <p>A few of the leading men of Vincennes, presided over by Gaspard Roussillon,
                        held a consultation at the river house, and it was agreed that a mass
                        meeting should be called bringing all of the inhabitants together in the
                        church for the purpose of considering the course to be taken under the
                        circumstances made known by Father Gibault. Oncle Jazon constituted himself
                        an executive committee of one to stir up a noise for the occasion.</p>
                    <p>It was a great day for Vincennes. The volatile temperament of the French
                        frontiersmen bubbled over <pb id="VAA2387-079" n="69"/> with enthusiasm at
                        the first hint of something new and revolutionary in which they might be
                        expected to take part. Without knowing in the least what it was that Father
                        Gibault and Oncle Jazon wanted of them, they were all in favor of it at a
                        venture.</p>
                    <p>Ren de Ronville, being an active and intelligent young man, was sent about
                        through the town to let everybody know of the meeting. In passing he stepped
                        into the cabin of Father Beret, who was sitting on the loose puncheon floor,
                        with his back turned toward the entrance and so absorbed in trying to put
                        together a great number of small paper fragments that he did not hear or
                        look up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you not going to the meeting, Father?&quot; Ren bluntly
                        demanded. In the hurry that was on him he did not remember to be formally
                        polite, as was his habit.</p>
                    <p>The old priest looked up with a startled face. At the same time he swept the
                        fragments of paper together and clutched them hard in his right hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, yes, my sonyes I am going, but the time has not yet come for
                        it, has it?&quot; he stammered. &quot;Is it late?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He sprang to his feet and appeared confused, as if caught in doing something
                        very improper.</p>
                    <p>Ren wondered at this unusual behavior, but merely said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I beg pardon, Father Beret, I did not mean to disturb
                        you,&quot; and went his way.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret stood for some minutes as if dazed, then squeezed the paper
                        fragments into a tight ball, <pb id="VAA2387-080" n="70"/> just as they were
                        when he took them from under the floor some time before Ren came in, and put
                        it in his pocket. A little later he was kneeling, as we have seen him once
                        before, in silent yet fervent prayer, his clasped hands lifted toward the
                        crucifix on the wall.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jesus, give me strength to hold on and do my work,&quot; he
                        murmured beseechingly, &quot;and oh, free thy poor servant from bitter
                        temptation.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Gibault had come prepared to use his eloquence upon the excitable
                        Creoles, and with considerable cunning he addressed a motley audience at the
                        church, telling them that an American force had taken Kaskaskia and would
                        henceforth hold it; that France had joined hands with the Americans against
                        the British, and that it was the duty of all Frenchmen to help uphold the
                        cause of freedom and independence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I come,&quot; said he, &quot;directly from Colonel George
                        Rogers Clark, a noble and brave officer of the American army, who told me
                        the news that I have brought to you. He sent me here to say to you that if
                        yen will give allegiance to his government you shall be protected against
                        all enemies and have the full freedom of citizens. I think you should do
                        this without a moment&apos;s hesitation, as I and my people at Kaskaskia
                        have already done. But perhaps you would like to have a word from your
                        distinguished fellow-citizen, Monsieur Gaspard Roussillon. Speak to your
                        friends, my son, they will be glad to take counsel of your wisdom.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was a stir and a craning of necks. M. Roussillon presently appeared
                        near the little chancel, his <pb id="VAA2387-081" n="71"/> great form
                        towering majestically. He bowed and waved his hand with the air of one who
                        accepts distinction as a matter of course; then he took his big silver watch
                        and looked at it. He was the only man in Vincennes who owned a watch, and so
                        the incident was impressive. Father Gibault looked pleased, and already a
                        murmur of applause went through the audience. M. Roussillon stroked the
                        bulging crystal of the time-piece with a circular motion of his thumb and
                        bowed again, clearing his throat resonantly, his face growing purplish above
                        his beard.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good friends,&quot; he said, &quot;what France does all
                        high-class Frenchmen applaud.&quot; He paused for a shout of
                        approbation, and was not disappointed. &quot;The other name for France
                        is glory,&quot; he added, &quot;and all true Frenchmen love both
                        names. I am a true Frenchman!&quot; and he struck his breast a
                        resounding blow with the hand that still held the watch. A huge horn button
                        on his buckskin jerkin came in contact with the crystal, and there was a
                        smash, followed by a scattered tinkling of glass fragments.</p>
                    <p>All Vincennes stood breathless, contemplating the irreparable accident. M.
                        Roussillon had lost the effect of a great period in his speech, but he was
                        quick. Lifting the watch to his ear, he listened a moment with superb
                        dignity, then slowly elevating his head and spreading his free hand over his
                        heart he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;The faithful time-piece still tells off the seconds, and the loyal
                        heart of its owner still throbs with patriotism.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon, who stood in front of the speaker, <pb id="VAA2387-082" n="72"/>
                        swung his shapeless cap as high as he could and yelled like a savage. Then
                        the crowd went wild for a time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Vive la France! A bas l&apos;
                        Angleterre!</hi>&quot; Everybody shouted at the top of his voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What France does we all do,&quot; continued M. Roussillon, when
                        the noise subsided. &quot;France has clasped hands with George
                        Washington and his brave compatriots; so do we.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Vive Zhorzh Vasinton!</hi>&quot; shrieked Oncle
                        Jazon in a piercing treble, tiptoeing and shaking his cap recklessly under
                        M. Roussillon&apos;s nose.</p>
                    <p>The orator winced and jerked his head back, but nobody saw it, save perhaps
                        Father Gibault, who laughed heartily.</p>
                    <p>Great sayings come suddenly, unannounced and unexpected. They have the
                        mysterious force of prophetic accident combined with happy economy of
                        phrasing. The southern blood in M. Roussillon&apos;s veins was
                        effervescing upon his brain; his tongue had caught the fine freedom and
                        abandon of inspired oratory. He towered and glowed; words fell melodiously
                        from his lips; his gestures were compelling, his visage magnetic. In
                        conclusion he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Frenchmen, America is the garden-spot of the world and will one
                        clay rule it, as did Rome of old. <hi rend="i">Where freedom makes her home,
                            there is the centre of power!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was in a little log church on the verge of a hummock overlooking a marshy
                        wild meadow. Westward for two thousand miles stretched the unbroken
                        prairies, woods, mountains, deserts reaching to the Pacific; <pb
                            id="VAA2387-083" n="73"/> southward for a thousand miles rolled the
                        green billows of the wilderness to the warm Gulf shore; northward to the
                        pole and eastward to the thin fringe of settlements beyond the mountains,
                        all was houseless solitude.</p>
                    <p>If the reader should go to Vincennes to-day and walk southward along Second
                        Street to its intersection with Church Street, the spot then under foot
                        would be probably very near where M. Roussillon stood while uttering his
                        great sentence. Mind you, the present writer does not pretend to know the
                        exact site of old Saint Xavier church. If it could be fixed beyond doubt the
                        spot should have an imperishable monument of Indiana stone.</p>
                    <p>When M. Roussillon ceased speaking the audience again exhausted its vocal
                        resources; and then Father Gibault called upon each man to come forward and
                        solemnly pledge his loyalty to the American cause. Not one of them
                        hesitated.</p>
                    <p>Meantime a woman was doing her part in the transformation of Post Vincennes
                        from a French-English picket to a full-fledged American fort and town.
                        Madame Godre, finding out what was about to happen, fell to work making a
                        flag in imitation of that under which George Washington was fighting. Alice
                        chanced to be in the Godre home at the time and joined enthusiastically in
                        the sewing. It was an exciting task. Their fingers trembled while they
                        worked, and the thread, heavily coated with beeswax, squeaked as they drew
                        it through the cloth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We shall not be in time,&quot; said Madame Godre; <pb
                            id="VAA2387-084" n="74"/> &quot;I know we shall not. Everything
                        hinders me. My thread breaks or gets tangled and my needle&apos;s so
                        rusty I can hardly stick it through the cloth. O dear!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice encouraged her with both words and work, and they had almost finished
                        when Ren came with a staff which he had brought from the fort.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mon dieu, but we have had a great meeting!&quot; he cried. He
                        was perspiring with excitement and fast walking; leaning on the staff he
                        mopped his face with a blue handkerchief.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We heard much shouting and noise,&quot; said Madame Godre.
                        &quot;M. Roussillon&apos;s voice rose loud above the rest. He roared
                        like a lion.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, he was speaking to us; he was very eloquent,&quot; Ren
                        replied. &quot;But now they are waiting at the fort for the new flag. I
                        have come for it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is ready,&quot; said Madame Godre.</p>
                    <p>With flying fingers Alice sewed it to the staff.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Voici</hi>&quot; she cried, &quot;<hi rend="i"
                            >vive la republiqne Americaine!</hi>&quot; She lifted the staff and
                        let the flag droop over her from head to foot.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give it to me,&quot; said Ren, holding forth a hand for it,
                        &quot;and I&apos;ll run to the fort with it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Alice, her face suddenly lighting up with
                        resolve. &quot;No, I am going to take it myself,&quot; and without a
                        moment&apos;s delay off she went.</p>
                    <p>Ren was so caught by surprise that he stood gazing after her until she passed
                        behind a house, where the way turned, the shining flag rippling around her,
                        and her moccasins twinkling as she ran.</p>
                    <p>At the blockhouse, awaiting the moment when the <pb id="VAA2387-085" n="75"/>
                        symbol of freedom should rise like a star over old Vincennes, the crowd had
                        picturesquely broken into scattered groups. Alice entered through a rent in
                        the stockade, as that happened to be a shorter route than through the gate,
                        and appeared suddenly almost in their midst.</p>
                    <p>It was a happy surprise, a pretty and catching spectacular apparition of a
                        sort to be thoroughly appreciated by the lively French fancy of the
                        audience. The men caught the girl&apos;s spirit, or it caught them, and
                        they made haste to be noisy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">V&apos;ia! V&apos;ia!
                            l&apos;p&apos;tite Alice et la bannire de Zhorzh Vasinton!</hi>
                        (Look, look, little Alice and George Washington&apos;s flag!)&quot;
                        shouted Oncle Jazon. He put his wiry little legs through a sort of pas de
                        zephyr and winked at himself with concentrated approval.</p>
                    <p>All the men danced around and yelled till they were hoarse.</p>
                    <p>By this time Ren had reached Alice&apos;s side; but she did not see him;
                        she ran into the blockhouse and climbed up a rude ladder-way; then she
                        appeared on the roof, still accompanied by Ren, and planted the staff in a
                        crack of the slabs, where it stood bravely up, the colors floating free.</p>
                    <p>She looked down and saw M. Roussillon, Father Gibault and Father Beret
                        grouped in the centre of the area. They were waving their hands aloft at
                        her, while a bedlam of voices sent up applause which went through her blood
                        like strong wine. She smiled radiantly, and a sweet flush glowed in her
                        cheeks.</p>
                    <p>No one of all that wild crowd could ever forget <pb id="VAA2387-086" n="76"/>
                        the picture sketched so boldly at that moment when, after planting the
                        staff, Alice stepped back a space and stood strong and beautiful against the
                        soft blue sky. She glanced down first, then looked up, her arms folded
                        across her bosom. It was a pose as unconsciously taken as that of a bird,
                        and the grace of it went straight to the hearts of those below.</p>
                    <p>She turned about to descend, and for the first time saw that Ren had followed
                        her. His face was beaming.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a girl you are!&quot; he exclaimed, in a tone of exultant
                        admiration. &quot;Never was there another like you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice walked quickly past him without speaking; for down in the space where
                        some women were huddled aside from the crowd, looking on, she had seen
                        little Adrienne Bourcier. She made haste to descend. Now that her
                        impulsively chosen enterprise was completed her boldness deserted her and
                        she slipped out through a dilapidated postern opposite the crowd. On her
                        right was the river, while southward before her lay a great flat plain,
                        beyond which rose some hillocks covered with forest. The sun blazed between
                        masses of slowly drifting clouds that trail creeping fantastic shadows
                        across the marshy waste.</p>
                    <p>Alice walked along under cover of the slight land-swell which then, more
                        plainly marked than it is now, formed the contour line of hummock upon which
                        the fort and village stood. A watery swale grown full of tall aquatic weeds
                        meandered parallel with the bluff, so to call it, and there was a soft
                        melancholy whispering <pb id="VAA2387-087" n="77"/> of wind among the long
                        blades and stems. She passed the church and Father Beret&apos;s hut and
                        continued for some distance in the direction of that pretty knoll upon which
                        the cemetery is at present so tastefully kept. She felt shy now, as if to
                        run away and hide would be a great relief. Indeed, so relaxed were her
                        nerves that a slight movement in the grass and cat-tail flags near by
                        startled her painfully, making her jump like a fawn.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Little friend not be &apos;fraid,&quot; said a guttural
                        voice in broken French. &quot;Little friend not make noise.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At a glance she recognized Long-Hair, the Indian, rising out of the matted
                        marsh growth. It was a hideous vision of embodied cunning, soullessness and
                        murderous cruelty.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not tell white man you sec me?&quot; he grunted
                        interrogatively, stepping close to her. He looked so wicked that she
                        recoiled and lifted her hands defensively.</p>
                    <p>She trembled from head to foot, and her voice failed her; but she made a
                        negative sign and smiled at him, turning as white as her tanned face could
                        become.</p>
                    <p>In his left hand he held his bow, while in his right he half lifted a
                        murderous looking tomahawk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What new flag mean?&quot; he demanded, waving the
                        bow&apos;s end toward the fort and bending his head down close to hers.
                        &quot;Who yonder?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The great American Father has taken us under his
                        protection,&quot; she explained. &quot;We are big-knives
                        now.&quot; It almost choked her to speak.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-088" n="78"/>
                    <p>&quot;Ugh! heap damn fools,&quot; he said with a dark scowl,
                        &quot;Little friend much damn fool.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He straightened up his tall form and stood leering at her for some seconds,
                        then added:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Little friend get killed, scalped, maybe.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The indescribable nobility of animal largeness, symmetry and strength showed
                        in his form and attitude, but the expression of his countenance was
                        absolutely repulsivecold, hard, beastly.</p>
                    <p>He did not speak again, but turned quickly, and stooping low, disappeared
                        like a great brownish red serpent in the high grass, which scarcely stirred
                        as he moved through it.</p>
                    <p>Somehow that day made itself strangely memorable to Alice. She had been
                        accustomed to stirring scenes and sudden changes of conditions; but this was
                        the first time that she had ever joined actively in a public movement of
                        importance. Then, too, Long-Hair&apos;s picturesque and rudely dramatic
                        reappearance affected her imagination with an indescribable force. Moreover,
                        the pathetic situation in the love affair between Ren and Adrienne had taken
                        hold of her conscience with a disturbing grip. But the shadowy sense of
                        impending events, of which she could form no idea was behind it all. She had
                        not heard of Brandywine, or Bunker Hill, or Lexington, or Concord; but
                        something like a waft of their significance had blown through her mind. A
                        great change was coming into her idyllic life. She was indistinctly aware of
                        it, as we sometimes are of an approaching storm, while yet the sky is
                        sweetly blue and serene. When she reached <pb id="VAA2387-089" n="79"/> home
                        the house was full of people to whom M. Roussillon, in the gayest of moods,
                        was dispensing wine and brandy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Vive Zhorzh Vasinton!</hi>&quot; shouted Oncle
                        Jazon as soon as he saw her.</p>
                    <p>And then they all talked at once, saying flattering things about her. Madame
                        Roussillon tried to scold as usual; but the lively chattering of the guests
                        drowned her voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose the American commander will send a garrison
                        here,&quot; some one said to Father Gibault, &quot;and repair the
                        fort.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Probably,&quot; the priest replied, &quot;in a very few
                        weeks. Meantime we will garrison it ourselves.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And we will have M. Roussillon for commander,&quot; spoke up
                        Ren de Ronville, who was standing by.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A good suggestion,&quot; assented Father Gibault; &quot;let
                        us organize at once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Immediately the word was passed that there would be a meeting at the fort
                        that evening for the purpose of choosing a garrison and a commander.
                        Everybody went promptly at the hour set. M. Roussillon was elected Captain
                        by acclamation, with Ren de Ronville as his Lieutenant. It was observed that
                        Oncle Jazon had resumed his dignity, and that he looked into his cap several
                        times without speaking.</p>
                    <p>Meantime certain citizens, who had been in close relations with Governor
                        Abbott during his stay, quietly slipped out of town, manned a batteau and
                        went up the river, probably to Ouiatenon first and then to <pb
                            id="VAA2387-090" n="80"/> Detroit. Doubtless they suspected that things
                        might soon grow too warm for their comfort.</p>
                    <p>It was thus that Vincennes and Fort Sackville first acknowledged the American
                        Government and hoisted the flag which, as long as it floated over the
                        blockhouse, was lightly and lovingly called by everyone <hi rend="i">la
                            bannire d&apos;Alice Roussillon.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Father Gibault returned to Fort Kaskaskia and a little later Captain Leonard
                        Helm, a jovial man, but past the prime of life, arrived at Vincennes with a
                        commission from Col. Clark authorizing him to supersede M. Roussillon as
                        commander, and to act as India agent for the American Government in the
                        Department of the Wabash. He was welcomed by the villagers, and at once made
                        himself very pleasing to them by adapting himself to their ways and entering
                        heartily into their social activities.</p>
                    <p>M. Roussillon was absent when Captain Helm and his party came. Ren de
                        Ronville, nominally in command of the fort, but actually enjoying some
                        excellent grouse shooting with a bell-mouthed old fowling piece on a distant
                        prairie, could not be present to deliver up the post; and as there was no
                        garrison just then visible, Helm took possession, without any formalities.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think, Lieutenant, that you&apos;d better look around through
                        the village and see if you can scare up this Captain
                        what&apos;s-his-name,&quot; said the new commander to a stalwart
                        young officer who had come with him. &quot;I can&apos;t think of
                        these French names without getting my brain in a twist. Do you happen to
                        recollect the Captain&apos;s name, Lieutenant?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-091" n="81"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir; Gaspard Roussillon it reads in Colonel Clark&apos;s
                        order; but I am told that he&apos;s away on a trading tour,&quot;
                        said the young man.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You may be told anything by these hair-tongued parlyvoos,&quot;
                        Helm remarked. &quot;It won&apos;t hurt, anyway, to find out where
                        he lives and make a formal call, just for appearance sake, and to enquire
                        about his health. I wish you would try it, sir, and let me know the
                        result.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Lieutenant felt that this was a Peremptory order and turned about to obey
                        promptly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I say, Beverley, come back sober, if you possibly
                        can,&quot; Helm added in his most genial tone, thinking it a great piece
                        of humor to suggest sobriety to a man whose marked difference from men
                        generally, of that time, was his total abstinence from intoxicating drinks.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant Fitzhugh Beverley was a Virginian of Virginians. His family had
                        long been prominent in colonial affairs and boasted a record of great
                        achievements both in peace and in war. He was the only son of his parents
                        and heir to a fine estate consisting of lands and slaves; but, like many
                        another of the restless young cavaliers of the Old Dominion, he had come in
                        search of adventure over into Kentucky, along the path blazed by Daniel
                        Boone; and when Clark organized his little army, the young man&apos;s
                        patriotic and chivalrous nature leaped at the opportunity to serve his
                        country under so gallant a commander.</p>
                    <p>Beverley was not a mere youth, although yet somewhat under thirty. Educated
                        abroad and naturally of a thoughtful and studious turn, he had enriched his
                        mind <pb id="VAA2387-092" n="82"/> far beyond the usual limit among young
                        Americans of the very best class in that time; and so he appeared older than
                        he really was: an effect helped out by his large and powerful form and grave
                        dignity of bearing. Clark, who found him useful in emergencies, cool,
                        intrepid, daring to a fault and possessed of excellent judgement, sent him
                        with Helm, hoping that he would offset with his orderly attention to details
                        the somewhat go-as-you-please disposition of that excellent officer.</p>
                    <p>Beverley set out in search of the French commander&apos;s house,
                        impressed with no particular respect for him or his office. Somehow
                        Americans of Anglo-Saxon blood were slow to recognize any good qualities
                        whatever in the Latin Creoles of the West and South. It seemed to them that
                        the Frenchman and the Spaniard were much too apt to equalize themselves
                        socially and matrimonially with Indians and negroes. The very fact that for
                        a century, while Anglo-Americans had been in constant bloody warfare with
                        savages, Frenchmen had managed to keep on easy and highly profitable trading
                        terms with them, tended to confirm the worst implication. &quot;Eat
                        frogs and save your scalp,&quot; was a bit of contemptuous frontier
                        humor indicative of what sober judgement held in reserve on the subject.</p>
                    <p>Intent upon his formal mission, Lieutenant Beverley stalked boldly into the
                        inclosure at Roussillon place and was met on the gallery by Madame
                        Roussillon in one of her worst moods. She glared at him with her hands on
                        her hips, her mouth set irritably aslant upward, her eyebrows gathered into
                        a dark knot over her nose. It would be hard to imagine a more forbidding
                        countenance; <pb id="VAA2387-093" n="83"/> and for supplementary effect out
                        popped hunchback Jean to stand behind her, with his big head lying back in
                        the hollow of his shoulders and his long chin elevated, while he gawped
                        intently up into Beverley&apos;s face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Bon jour, Madame</hi>,&quot; said the Lieutenant,
                        lifting his hat and speaking with a pleasant accent. &quot;Would it be
                        agreeable to Captain Roussillon for me to see him a moment?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Despite Beverley&apos;s cleverness in using the French language, he had a
                        decided brusqueness of manner and a curt turn of voice not in the least
                        Gallic. True, the soft Virginian intonation marked every word, and his
                        obeisance was as low as if Madame Roussillon had been a queen; but the light
                        French grace was wholly lacking.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you want of my husband?&quot; Madame Roussillon
                        demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing unpleasant, I assure you, Madame,&quot; said Beverley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, he&apos;s not at home, Mo&apos;sieu; he&apos;s up
                        the river for a few days.</p>
                    <p>She relaxed her stare, untied her eyebrows, and even let fall her hands from
                        her shelf-like hips.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you, Madame,&quot; said Beverley, bowing again,
                        &quot;I am sorry not to have seen him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As he was turning to go a shimmer of brown hair streaked with gold struck
                        upon his vision from just within the door. He paused, as if in response to a
                        military command, while a pair of gray eyes met his with a flash. The cabin
                        room was ill lighted; but the crepuscular dimness did not seem to hinder his
                        sight. <pb id="VAA2387-094" n="84"/> Beyond the girl&apos;s figure, a
                        pair of slender swords hung crossed aslant on the wall opposite the low
                        door.</p>
                    <p>Beverley had seen, in the old world galleries, pictures in which the shadowy
                        and somewhat uncertain background thus forced into strongest projection the
                        main figure, yet without clearly defining it. The rough frame of the doorway
                        gave just the rustic setting suited to Alice&apos;s costume, the most
                        striking part of which was a grayish short gown ending just above her
                        fringed buckskin moccasins. Around her head she had bound a blue kerchief, a
                        wide corner of which lay over her crown like a loose cap. Her bright hair
                        hung free upon her shoulders in tumbled half curls. As a picture, the figure
                        and its <hi rend="i">entourage</hi> might have been artistically effective;
                        but as Beverley saw it in actual life the first impression was rather
                        embarrassing. Somehow he felt almost irresistibly invited to laugh, though
                        he had never been much given to risibility. The blending, or rather the
                        juxtaposition, of extremesa face, a form immediately witching, and a costume
                        odd to grotesqueryhad made an assault upon his comprehension at once so
                        sudden and so direct that his dignity came near being disastrously broken
                        up. A splendidly beautiful child comically clad would have made much the
                        same half delightful, half displeasing impression.</p>
                    <p>Beverley could not stare at the girl, and no sooner had he turned his back
                        upon her than the picture in his mind changed like a scene in a
                        kaleidoscope. He now saw a tall, finely developed figure and a face
                        delicately oval, with a low, wide forehead, arched brows, a straight,
                        slightly tip-tilted nose, a mouth sweet and full, <pb id="VAA2387-095"
                            n="85"/> dimpled cheeks, and a strong chin set above a faultless throat.
                        His imagination, in casting off its first impression, was inclined to
                        exaggerate Alice&apos;s beauty and to dwell upon its picturesqueness. He
                        smiled as he walked back to the fort, and even found himself whistling gayly
                        a snatch from a rollicking fiddle-tune that he had heard when a boy.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">A FENCING BOUT</head>
                    <p>A few days after Helm&apos;s arrival, M. Roussillon returned to
                        Vincennes, and if he was sorely touched in his <hi rend="i">amour
                        propre</hi> by seeing his suddenly acquired military rank and title drop
                        away, he did not let it be known to his fellow citizens. He promptly called
                        upon the new commander and made acquaintance with Lieutenant Fitzhugh
                        Beverley, who just then was superintending the work of cleaning up an old
                        cannon in the fort and mending some breaks in the stockade.</p>
                    <p>Helm formed a great liking for the big Frenchman, whose breezy freedom of
                        manner and expansive good humor struck him favorably from the beginning. M.
                        Roussillon&apos;s ability to speak English with considerable ease helped
                        the friendship along, no doubt; at all events their first interview ended
                        with a hearty show of good fellowship, and as time passed they became almost
                        inseparable companions during M. Roussillon&apos;s periods of rest from
                        his trading excursions among the Indians. They played cards and brewed hot
                        drinks over which they told marvelous stories, the latest one invariably
                        surpassing all its predecessors.</p>
                    <p>Helm had an eye to business, and turned M. Roussillon&apos;s knowledge of
                        the Indians to valuable account, so that he soon had very pleasant relations
                        with most of the tribes within reach of his agents. This gave a feeling of
                        great security to the people of Vincennes.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-097" n="87"/>
                    <p>They pursued their narrow agricultural activities with excellent results and
                        redoubled those social gayeties which, even in hut and cabin under all the
                        adverse conditions of extreme frontier life, were dear to the volatile and
                        genial French temperament.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant Beverley found much to interest him in the quaint town; but the
                            <hi rend="i">pice de rsistance</hi> was Oncle Jazon, who proved to be
                        both fascinating and unmanageable; a hard nut to crack, yet possessing a
                        kernel absolutely original in flavor. Beverley visited him one evening in
                        his hutit might better be called dena curiously built thing, with walls of
                        vertical poles set in a quadrangular trench dug in the ground, and roofed
                        with grass. Inside and out it was plastered with clay, and the floor of
                        dried mud was as smooth and hard as concrete paving. In one end there was a
                        wide fireplace grimy with soot, in the other a mere peep-hole for a window;
                        a wooden bench, a bed of skins and two or three stools were barely visible
                        in the gloom. In the doorway Oncle Jazon sat whittling a slender billet of
                        hickory into a ramrod for his long flint-lock American rifle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe ye know Simon Kenton,&quot; said the old man, after he
                        and Beverley had conversed for a while, &quot;seeing that you are from
                        Kentuckyeh?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I do know him well; he&apos;s a warm personal friend of
                        mine,&quot; said Beverley with quick interest, for it surprised him that
                        Oncle Jazon should know anything about Kenton. &quot;Do you know him,
                        Monsieur Jazon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon winked conceitedly and sighted along <pb id="VAA2387-098" n="88"
                        /> his rudimentary ramrod to see if it was straight; then puckering his
                        lips, as if on the point of whistling, made an affirmative noise quite
                        impossible to spell.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m glad you are aquainted with Kenton,&quot;
                        said Beverley. &quot;Where did you and he come together?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon chuckled reminiscently and scratched the skinless, cicatrized
                        spot where his scalp had once flourished.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, several places,&quot; he answered. &quot;Ye see thet
                        hair a hangin&apos; there on the wall?&quot; He pointed at a dry
                        wisp dangling under a peg in a log barely visible by the bad light.
                        &quot;Well, thet&apos;s my scalp, he! he! he!&quot; He snickered
                        as if the fact were a most enjoyable joke. &quot;Simon Kenton can tell
                        ye about thet little affair! The Indians thought I was dead, and they took
                        my hair; but I wasn&apos;t dead; I was just a givin&apos;
                        &apos;em a &apos;possum act. When they was gone I got up from where
                        I was a layin&apos; and trotted off. My head was sore and <hi rend="i"
                            >ventrebleu</hi>! but I was mad, he! he! he!&quot;</p>
                    <p>All this time he spoke in French, and the English but poorly paraphrases his
                        odd turns of expression. His grimaces and grunts cannot even be hinted.</p>
                    <p>It was a long story, as Beverley received it, told scrappily, but with
                        certain rude art. In the end Oncle Jazon said with unctuous
                        self-satisfaction:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Accidents will happen. I got my chance at that damned Indian who
                        skinned my head, and I jes took a bead on &apos;im with my old rifle. I
                        can&apos;t shoot much, never could, but I happened to hit &apos;im
                        square in the <unclear>-ef</unclear> eye, what I shot at, and it was a
                        hundred yards.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-099" n="89"/>
                    <p>Down he tumbles, and I runs to &apos;im and finds my same old scalp a
                        hangin&apos; to his belt. Well, I lifted off his hair with my knife, and
                        untied mine from the belt, and then I had both scalps, he! he! he! You ask
                        Simon Kenton when ye see &apos;im. He was along at the same time, and
                        they made &apos;im run the ga&apos;ntlet and pretty nigh beat the
                        life out o&apos; &apos;im. <hi rend="i">Ventrebleu!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley now recollected hearing Kenton tell the same grim story by a
                        camp-fire in the hills of Kentucky. Somehow it had caught a new spirit in
                        the French rendering, which linked it with the old tales of adventure that
                        he had read in his boyhood, and it suddenly endeared Oncle Jazon to him. The
                        rough old scrap of a man and the powerful youth chatted together until
                        sundown, smoking their pipes, each feeling for what was best in the other,
                        half aware that in the future they would be tested together in the fire of
                        wild adventure. Every man is more or less a prophet at certain points in his
                        life.</p>
                    <p>Twilight and moonlight were blending softly when Beverley, on his way back to
                        the fort, departing from a direct course, went along the river&apos;s
                        side southward to have a few moments of reflective strolling within reach of
                        the water&apos;s pleasant murmur and the town&apos;s indefinite
                        evening stir. Rich sweetness, the gift of early autumn, was on the air
                        blowing softly out of a lilac west and singing in the willow fringe that
                        hung here and there over the bank.</p>
                    <p>On the farther side of the river&apos;s wide flow, swollen by recent
                        heavy rains, Beverley saw a pirogue, in one end of which a dark figure
                        swayed to the strokes of a <pb id="VAA2387-100" n="90"/> paddle. The slender
                        and shallow little craft was bobbing on the choppy waves and taking a
                        zig-zag course among floating logs and masses of lighter driftwood, while
                        making slow but certain headway toward the hither bank.</p>
                    <p>Beverley took a bit of punk and a flint and steel from his pocket, relit his
                        pipe and stood watching the skilful boatman conduct his somewhat dangerous
                        voyage diagonally against the rolling current. It was a shifting,
                        hide-and-seek scene, its features appearing and disappearing with the action
                        of the waves and the doubtful light reflected from fading clouds and sky.
                        Now and again the man stood up in his skittish pirogue, balancing himself
                        with care, to use a short pole in shoving driftwood out of his way; and more
                        than once he looked to Beverley as if he had plunged headlong into the dark
                        water.</p>
                    <p>The spot, as nearly as it can be fixed, was about two hundred yards below
                        where the public road-bridge at present spans the Wabash. The bluff was then
                        far different from what it is now, steeper and higher, with less silt and
                        sand between it and the water&apos;s edge. Indeed, swollen as the
                        current was, a man could stand on the top of the bank and easily leap into
                        the deep water. At a point near the middle of the river a great mass of
                        drift-logs and sand had long ago formed a barrier which split the stream so
                        that one current came heavily shoreward on the side next the town and
                        swashed with its muddy foam, making a swirl and eddy just below where
                        Beverley stood.</p>
                    <p>The pirogue rounded the upper angle of this obstruction, <pb id="VAA2387-101"
                            n="91"/> not without difficulty to its crew of one, and swung into the
                        rapid shoreward rush, as was evidently planned for by the steersman, who now
                        paddled against the tide with all his might to keep from being borne too far
                        down stream for a safe landing place.</p>
                    <p>Beverley stood at ease idly and half dreamily looking on, when suddenly
                        something caused a catastrophe, which for a moment he did not comprehend. In
                        fact the man in the pirogue came to grief, as a man in a pirogue is very apt
                        to do, and fairly somersaulted overboard into the water. Nothing serious
                        would have threatened (for the man could swim like an otter) had not a
                        floating, half submerged log thrust up some short, stiff stumps of boughs,
                        upon the points of which the man struck heavily and was not only hurt, but
                        had his clothes impaled securely by one of the ugly spears, so that he hung
                        in a helpless position, while the water&apos;s motion alternately lifted
                        and submerged him, his arms beating about wildly.</p>
                    <p>When Beverley heard a strangling cry for help, he pulled himself promptly
                        together, flung off his coat, as if by a single motion, and leaped down the
                        bank into the water. He was a swimmer whose strokes counted for all that
                        prodigious strength and excellent training could afford; he rushed through
                        the water with long sweeps, making a semicircle, rounding against the
                        current, so as to swing down upon the drowning man.</p>
                    <p>Less than a half-hour later a rumor by some means spread throughout the town
                        that Father Beret and Lieutenant Beverley were drowned in the Wabash. But
                        when a crowd gathered to verify the terrible news <pb id="VAA2387-102"
                            n="92"/> it turned out to be untrue. Gaspard Roussillon had once more
                        distinguished himself by an exhibition of heroic nerve and muscle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Ventrebleu! Quel homme!</hi>&quot; exclaimed Oncle
                        Jazon, when told that M. Roussillon had come up the bank of the Wabash with
                        Lieutenant Beverley under one arm and Father Beret under the other, both men
                        apparently dead.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bring them to my house immediately,&quot; M. Roussillon
                        ordered, as soon as they were restored to consciousness; and he shook
                        himself, as a big wet animal sometimes does, covering everybody near him
                        with muddy water. Then he led the way with melodramatic strides.</p>
                    <p>In justice to historical accuracy there must be a trifling reform of what
                        appeared on the face of things to be grandly true. Gaspard Roussillon
                        actually dragged Father Beret and Lieutenant Beverley one at a time out of
                        the eddy water and up the steep river bank. That was truly a great feat; but
                        the hero never explained. When men arrived he was standing between the
                        collapsed forms, panting and dripping. Doubtless he looked just as if he had
                        dropped them from under his arms, and why shouldn&apos;t he have the
                        benefit of a great implication?</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve saved them both,&quot; he roared; from which, of
                        course, the ready creole imagination inferred the extreme of possible heroic
                        performance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bring them to my house immediately,&quot; and it was
                        accordingly done.</p>
                    <p>The procession, headed by M. Roussillon, moved <pb id="VAA2387-103" n="93"/>
                        noisily, for the French tongue must shake off what comes to it on the thrill
                        of every exciting moment. The only silent Frenchman is the dead one.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret was not only well-nigh drowned, but seriously hurt. He lay for a
                        week on a bed in M. Roussillon&apos;s house before he could sit up.
                        Alice hung over him night and day, scarcely sleeping or eating until he was
                        past all danger. As for Beverley, he shook off all the effects of his
                        struggle in a little while. Next day he was out, as well and strong as ever,
                        busy with the affairs of his office. Nor was he less happy on account of
                        what the little adventure had cast into his experience. It is good to feel
                        that one has done an unselfish deed, and no young man&apos;s heart
                        repels the freshness of what comes to him when a beautiful girl first enters
                        his life.</p>
                    <p>Naturally enough Alice had some thoughts of Beverley while she was so
                        attentively caring for Father Beret. She had never before seen a man like
                        him, nor had she read of one. Compared with Ren de Ronville, the best youth
                        of her acquaintance, he was in every way superior; this was too evident for
                        analysis; but referred to the romantic standard taken out of the novels she
                        had read, he somehow failed; and yet he loomed bravely in her vision, not
                        exactly a knight of the class she had most admired, still unquestionably a
                        hero of large proportions.</p>
                    <p>Beverley stepped in for a few minutes every day to see Father Beret,
                        involuntarily lengthening his visit by a sliding ratio as he became better
                        acquainted. He began to enjoy the priest&apos;s conversation, with its
                        sly wordly wisdom cropping up through fervid religious <pb id="VAA2387-104"
                            n="94"/> sentiments and quaint humor. Alice must have interested him
                        more than he was fully aware of; for his eyes followed her, as she came and
                        went, with a curious criticism of her half-savage costume and her springy,
                        Dryad-like suppleness, which reminded him of the shyest and gracefulest wild
                        birds; and yet a touch of refinement, the subtlest and best, showed in all
                        her ways. He studied her, as he would have studied a strange, showy and
                        originally fragrant flower, or a bird of oddly attractive plumage. While she
                        said little to him or to anyone else in his presence, he became aware of the
                        willfulness and joyous lightness which played on her nature&apos;s
                        changeable surface. He wondered at her influence over Father Beret, whom she
                        controlled apparently without effort. But in due time he began to feel a
                        deeper character, a broader intelligence, behind her superficial <hi
                            rend="i">sauvagerie</hi>; and he found that she really had no mean
                        smattering of books in the lighter vein.</p>
                    <p>A little thing happened which further opened his eyes and increased the
                        interest that her beauty and elementary charm of style aroused in him
                        gradually, apace with their advancing acquaintanceship.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret had got well and returned to his hut and his round of spiritual
                        duties; but Beverley came to Roussillon place every day all the same. For a
                        wonder Madame Roussillon liked him, and at most times held the scolding side
                        of her tongue when he was present. Jean, too, made friendly advances
                        whenever opportunity afforded. Of course Alice gave him just the frank
                        cordiality of hospitable welcome demanded by frontier conditions. She
                        scarcely knew whether she liked him <pb id="VAA2387-105" n="95"/> or not;
                        but he had a treasury of information from which he was enriching her with
                        liberal carelessness day by day. The hungriest part of her mind was being
                        sumptuously banqueted at his expense. Mere intellectual greediness drew her
                        to him.</p>
                    <p>Naturally they soon threw off such troubling formalities as at first rose
                        between them, and began to disclose to each other their true
                        characteristics. Alice found in Beverley a large target for the missiles of
                        her clever and tantalizing perversity. He in turn practiced a native dignity
                        and an acquired superiority of manner to excellent effect. It was a meeting
                        of Greek with Greek in a new Arcadia. To him here was Diana, strong,
                        strange, simple, even crude almost to naturalness, yet admirably pure in
                        spirit and imbued with highest womanly aspirations. To her Beverley
                        represented the great outside area of life. He came to her from wonderland,
                        beyond the wide circle of houseless woods and prairies. He represented
                        gorgeous cities, teeming parks of fashion, boulevards, salons, halls of
                        social splendor, the theater, the world of woman&apos;s dreams.</p>
                    <p>Now, there is an antagonism, vague yet powerful, generated between natures
                        thus cast together from the opposite poles of experience and education: an
                        antagonism practically equivalent to the most vigorous attraction. What one
                        knows the other is but half aware of; neither knowledge nor ignorance being
                        mutual, there is a scintillation of exchange, from opposing vantage grounds,
                        followed by harmless snaps of thunder. Culture and refinement take on airsit
                        is the <pb id="VAA2387-106" n="96"/> deepest artificial instinct of
                        enlightenment to posein the presence of naturalness; and there is a certain
                        style of ignorance which attitudinizes before the gate of knowledge. The
                        return to nature has always been the dream of the conventionalized soul,
                        while the simple Arcadian is forever longing for the maddening honey of
                        sophistication.</p>
                    <p>Innate jealousies strike together like flint and steel dashing off sparks by
                        which nearly everything that life can warm its core withal is kindled and
                        kept burning. What I envy in my friend I store for my best use. I thrust and
                        parry, not to kill, but to learn my adversary&apos;s superior feints and
                        guards. And this hint of sword play leads back to what so greatly surprised
                        and puzzled Beverley one day when he chanced to be examining the pair of <hi
                            rend="i">colechemardes</hi> on the wall.</p>
                    <p>He took one down, and handling it with the indescribable facility possible to
                        none save a practical swordsman, remarked:</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s a world of fascination in these things; I like
                        nothing better than a bout at fencing. Does your father practice the
                        art?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have no father, no mother,&quot; she quickly said;
                        &quot;but good Papa Roussillon does like a little exercise with the <hi
                            rend="i">colechemarde.</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m glad to hear it, I shall ask to teach him a
                        trick or two,&quot; Beverley responded in the lightest mood.
                        &quot;When will he return from the woods?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t tell you; he&apos;s very irregular in such
                        matters,&quot; she said. Then, with a smile half banter and half
                        challenge, she added; &quot;if you are really dying for <pb
                            id="VAA2387-107" n="97"/> some exercise, you shall not have to wait for
                        him to come home, I assure you, Monsieur Beverley.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, it&apos;s Monsieur de Ronville, perhaps, that you will
                        offer up as a victim to my skill and address,&quot; he slyly returned;
                        for he was suspecting that a love affair in some stage of progress lay
                        between her and Ren.</p>
                    <p>She blushed violently, but quickly overcoming a combined rush of surprise and
                        anger, added with an emphasis as charming as it was unexpected.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I myself am, perhaps, swordsman enough to satisfy the impudence and
                        vanity of Monsieur Beverley, Lieutenant in the American army.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pardon me, Mademoiselle; forgive me, I beg of you,&quot; he
                        exclaimed, earnestly modulating his voice to sincerest beseechment;
                        &quot;I really did not mean to be impudent, nor&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her vivacity cleared with a merry laugh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No apologies, I command you,&quot; she interposed. &quot;We
                        will have them after I have taught you a fencing lesson.&quot;</p>
                    <p>From a shelf she drew down a pair of foils and presenting the hilts, bade him
                        take his choice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There isn&apos;t any difference between them that I know
                        of,&quot; she said, and then added archly; &quot;but you will feel
                        better at last, when all is over and the sting of defeat tingles through
                        you, if you are conscious of having used every sensible
                        precaution.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked straight into her eyes, trying to catch what was in her mind, but
                        there was a bewildering glamour playing across those gray, opal-tinted wells
                        of <pb id="VAA2387-108" n="98"/> mystery, from which he could draw only a
                        mischievous smile-glint, direct, daring, irresistible.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, taking one of the foils, &quot;what do
                        you really mean? Is it a challenge without room for honorable
                        retreat?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The time for parley is past,&quot; she replied,
                        &quot;follow me to the battle-ground.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She led the way to a pleasant little court in the rear of the
                        cabin&apos;s yard, a space between two wings and a vine-covered trellis,
                        beyond which lay a well kept vineyard and vegetable garden. Here she turned
                        about and faced him, poising her foil with a fine grace.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you ready?&quot; she inquired.</p>
                    <p>He tried again to force a way into the depths of her eyes with his; but he
                        might as well have attacked the sun; so he stood in a confusion of not very
                        well defined feelings, undecided, hesitating, half expecting that there
                        would be some laughable turn to end the affair.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you afraid, Monsieur Beverley?&quot; she demanded after a
                        short waiting in silence.</p>
                    <p>He laughed now and whipped the air with his foil.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You certainly are not in earnest?&quot; he said
                        interrogatively. &quot;Do you really mean that you want to fence with
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you think because I&apos;m only a girl you can easily beat
                        me, try it,&quot; she tauntingly replied making a level thrust toward
                        his breast.</p>
                    <p>Quick as a flash he parried, and then a merry clinking and twinkling of steel
                        blades kept time to their swift movements. Instantly, by the sure sense
                        which is half sight, half feelingthe sense that guides the expert <pb
                            id="VAA2387-109" n="99"/> fencer&apos;s hand and wristBeverley knew
                        that he had probably more than his match, and in ten seconds his attack was
                        met by a time thrust in opposition which touched him sharply.</p>
                    <p>Alice sprang far back, lowered her point and laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Je vous salue, Monsieur Beverley!</hi>&quot; she
                        cried, with childlike show of delight. &quot;Did you feel the
                        button?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I felt it,&quot; he said with frank acknowledgment in his
                        voice, &quot;it was cleverly done. Now give me a chance to redeem
                        myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He began more carefully and found that she, too, was on her best mettle; but
                        it was a short bout, as before. Alice seemed to give him an easy opening and
                        he accepted it with a thrust; then something happened that he did not
                        understand. The point of his foil was somehow caught under his
                        opponent&apos;s hilt-guard while her blade seemed to twist around his;
                        at the same time there was a wring and a jerk, the like of which he had
                        never before felt, and he was disarmed, his wrist and fingers aching with
                        the wrench they had received.</p>
                    <p>Of course the thing was not new; he had been disarmed before; but her trick
                        of doing it was quite a mystery to him, altogether different from any that
                        he had ever seen.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Vous me pardonnerez, Monsieur</hi>,&quot; she
                        mockingly exclaimed, picking up his weapon and offering the hilt to him.
                        &quot;Here is your sword!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Keep it,&quot; he said, folding his arms and trying to look
                        unconcerned, &quot;you have captured it fairly. I am at your mercy; be
                        kind to me.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-110" n="100"/>
                    <p>Madame Roussillon and Jean, the hunchback, hearing the racket of the foils
                        had come out to see and were standing agape.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You ought to be ashamed, Alice,&quot; said the dame in scolding
                        approval of what she had done; &quot;girls do not fence with
                        gentlemen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;This girl does,&quot; said Alice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And with extreme disaster to this gentleman,&quot; said
                        Beverley, laughing in a tone of discomfiture and resignation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, Mo&apos;sieu&apos;, there&apos;s nothing but
                        disaster where she goes,&quot; complained Madame Roussillon,
                        &quot;she is a destroyer of everything. Only yesterday she dropped my
                        pink bowl and broke it, the only one I had.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And just to think,&quot; said Beverley, &quot;what would
                        have been the condition of my heart had we been using rapiers instead of
                        leather-buttoned foils! She would have spitted it through the very
                        center.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Like enough,&quot; replied the dame indifferently.
                        &quot;She wouldn&apos;t wince, either,not she.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice ran into the house with the foils and Beverley followed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We must try it over again some day soon,&quot; he said;
                        &quot;I find that you can show me a few points. Where did you learn to
                        fence so admirably? Is Monsieur Roussillon your master?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed he isn&apos;t,&quot; she quickly replied,
                        &quot;he is but a bungling swordsman. My masterbut I am not at liberty
                        to tell you who has taught me the little I know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, whoever he is I should be glad to have lessons from
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-111" n="101"/>
                    <p>&quot;But you&apos;ll never get them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A woman&apos;s ultimatum.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;As good as a man&apos;s!&quot; she bridled prettily;
                        &quot;and sometimes betterat the foils for example. <hi rend="i"
                            >Vouscomprenez, n&apos;est ce pas?</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>He laughed heartily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, your point reaches me,&quot; he said, &quot;but <hi
                            rend="i">sperat et in saeva victus gladiatur arena</hi>, as the old
                        Latin poet wisely remarks.&quot; The quotation was meant to tease her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, Montaigne translated that or something in his book,&quot;
                        she commented with prompt erudition. &quot;I understand it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley looked amazed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you know about Montaigne?&quot; he demanded with a
                        blunt brevity amounting to something like gruffness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sh&apos;, Monsieur, not too loud,&quot; she softly
                        protested, looking around to see that neither Madame Roussillon nor Jean had
                        followed them into the main room. &quot;It is not permitted that I read
                        that old book; but they do not hide it from me, because they think I
                        can&apos;t make out its dreadful spelling.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She smiled so that her cheeks drew their dimples deep into the delicately
                        tinted pink-and-brown, where wind and sun and wholesome exercise had set the
                        seal of absolute health, and took from a niche in the logs of the wall a
                        stained and dog-eared volume. He <pb id="VAA2387-112" n="102"/> looked, and
                        it was, indeed, the old saint and sinner, Montaigne.</p>
                    <p>Involuntarily he ran his eyes over the girl from head to foot, comparing her
                        show of knowledge with the outward badges of abject rusticity, and even
                        wildness, with which she was covered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;you are a mystery.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think it surprising that I can read a book! Frankly I
                        can&apos;t understand half of this one. I read it becausewell just
                        because they want me to read about nothing but sickly old saints and
                        woe-begone penitents. I like something lively. What do I care for all that
                        uninteresting religious stuff?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Montaigne <hi rend="i">is</hi> decidedly lively in spots,&quot;
                        Beverley remarked. &quot;I shouldn&apos;t think a girlI
                        shouldn&apos;t think you&apos;d particularly enjoy his
                        humors.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t care for the book at all,&quot; she said,
                        flushing quickly, &quot;only I seem to learn about the world from it.
                        Sometimes it seems as if it lifted me up high above all this wild, lonely
                        and tiresome country, so that I can see far off where things are different
                        and beautiful. It is the same with the novels; and they don&apos;t
                        permit me to read them either; but all the same I do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When Beverley, taking his leave, passed through the gate at Roussillon place,
                        he met Ren de Ronville going in. It was a notable coincidence that each
                        young man felt something troublesome rise in his throat as he looked into
                        the other&apos;s eyes.</p>
                    <p>A week of dreamy autumn weather came on, during which Beverley managed to be
                        with Alice a great deal, mostly sitting on the Roussillon gallery, where the
                            <pb id="VAA2387-113" n="103"/> fading vine leaves made fairy whispering,
                        and where the tempered breeze blew deliciously cool from over the distant
                        multi-colored woods. The men of Vincennes were gathering their Indian corn
                        early to dry it on the cob for grating into winter meal. Many women made
                        wine from the native grapes and from the sweeter and richer fruit of
                        imported vines. Madame Roussillon and Alice stained their hands a deep
                        purple during the pressing season, and Beverley found himself engaged in
                        helping them handle the juicy crop, while around the overflowing earthen
                        pots the wild bees, wasps and hornets hummed with an incessant, jarring
                        monotony.</p>
                    <p>Jean, the hunchback, gathered ample stores of hickory nuts, walnuts,
                        hazel-nuts and pin-oak acorns. Indeed, the whole population of the village
                        made a great spurt of industry just before the falling of winter; and
                        presently, when every preparation had been completed for the dreaded cold
                        season, M. Roussillon carried out his long-cherished plan, and gave a great
                        party at the river house. After the most successful trading experience of
                        all his life he felt irrepressibly liberal.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s have one more roaring good time,&quot; he said,
                        &quot;that&apos;s what life is for.&quot;</p>

                    <head type="main">CHAPTER VII</head>
                    <head type="subtitle">THE MAYOR&apos;S PARTY</head>
                    <p>Beverley was so surprised and confused in his mind by the ease with which he
                        had been mastered at sword-play by a mere girl, that he felt as if just
                        coming out of a dream. In fact the whole affair seemed unreal, yet so vivid
                        and impressive in all its main features, that he could not emerge from it
                        and look it calmly over from without. His experience with women had not
                        prepared him for a ready understanding and acceptance of a girl like Alice.
                        While he was fully aware of her beauty, freshness, vivacity and grace, this
                        Amazonian strength of hers, this boldness of spirit, this curious mixture of
                        frontier crudeness and a certain adumbrationso to call itof patrician
                        sensibilities and aspirations, affected him both pleasantly and
                        unpleasantly. He did not sympathize promptly with her semi-barbaric costume;
                        she seemed not gently feminine, as compared with the girls of Virginia and
                        Maryland. He resented her muscular development and her independent
                        disposition. She was far from coarseness, however, and, indeed, a trace of
                        subtle refinement, although not conventional, imbued her whole character.</p>
                    <p>But why was he thinking so critically about her? Had his selfishness received
                        an incurable shock from the button of her foil? A healthy young man of the
                        right sort is apt to be jealous of his physical prowesstouch him there and
                        he will turn the world over to <pb id="VAA2387-115" n="105"/> right himself
                        in his own admiration and yours. But to be beaten on his highest ground of
                        virility by a dimple-faced maiden just leaving her teens could not offer
                        Beverley any open way to recoupment of damages.</p>
                    <p>He tried to shake her out of his mind, as a bit of pretty and troublesome
                        rubbish, what time he pursued his not very exacting military duties. But the
                        more he shook the tighter she clung, and the oftener he went to see her.</p>
                    <p>Helm was a good officer in many respects, and his patriotism was of the best;
                        but he liked jolly company, a glass of something strong and a large share of
                        ease. Detroit lay many miles northeastward across the wilderness, and the
                        English, he thought, would scarcely come so far to attack his little post,
                        especially now that most of the Indians in the intervening country had
                        declared in favor of the Americans. Recently, too, the weather had been
                        favoring him by changing from wet to dry, so that the upper Wabash and its
                        tributaries were falling low and would soon be very difficult to navigate
                        with large batteaux.</p>
                    <p>Very little was done to repair the stockade and dilapidated remnant of a
                        blockhouse. There were no sufficient barracks, a mere shed in one angle
                        serving for quarters, and the old cannon could not have been used to any
                        effect in case of attack. As for the garrison, it was a nominal quantity,
                        made up mostly of men who preferred hunting and fishing to the merest
                        pretense of military duty.</p>
                    <p>Gaspard Roussillon assumed to know everything about Indian affairs and the
                        condition of the English <pb id="VAA2387-116" n="106"/> at Detroit. His
                        optimistic eloquence lulled Helm to a very pleasant sense of security.
                        Beverley was not so easy to satisfy; but his suggestions regarding military
                        discipline and a vigorous prosecution of repairs to the blockhouse and
                        stockade were treated with dilatory geniality by his superior officer. The
                        soft wonder of a perfect Indian summer glorified land, river and sky. Why
                        not dream and bask? Why not drink exhilarating toddies?</p>
                    <p>Meantime the entertainment to be given by Gaspard Roussillon occupied
                        everybody&apos;s imagination to an unusual extent. Ren de Ronville,
                        remembering but not heeding the doubtful success of his former attempt, went
                        long beforehand to claim Alice as his <hi rend="i">partenaire</hi>; but she
                        flatly refused him, once more reminding him of his obligations to little
                        Adrienne Bourcier. He would not be convinced.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are bound to me,&quot; he said, &quot;you promised
                        before, you know, and the party was but put off. I hold you to it; you are
                        my <hi rend="i">partenaire</hi>, and I am yours, you can&apos;t deny
                        that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No you are not my <hi rend="i">partenaire</hi>,&quot; she
                        firmly said; then added lightly, &quot;<hi rend="i">Feu mon
                        partenaire</hi>, you are dead and buried as my partner at that
                        dance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He glowered in silence for a few moments, then said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is Lieutenant Beverley, I suppose.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She gave him a quick contemptuous look, but turned it instantly into one of
                        her tantalizing smiles.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you imagine that?&quot; she demanded.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-117" n="107"/>
                    <p>&quot;Imagine it! I know it,&quot; he said with a hot flush.
                        &quot;Have I no sense?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Precious little,&quot; she replied with a merry laugh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go to Father Beret, tell him everything, and then ask him what he
                        thinks,&quot; she said in a calm, even tone, her face growing serious.</p>
                    <p>There was an awkward silence.</p>
                    <p>She had touched Ren&apos;s vulnerable spot; he was nothing if not a
                        devout Catholic, and his conscience rooted itself in what good Father Beret
                        had taught him.</p>
                    <p>The church, no matter by what name it goes, Catholic or Protestant, has a
                        saving hold on the deepest inner being of its adherents. No grip is so hard
                        to shake off as that of early religious convictions. The still, small voice
                        coming down from the times &quot;When shepherds watched their flocks by
                        night,&quot; in old Judea, passes through the priest, the minister, the
                        preacher; it echoes in cathedral, church, open-air meeting; it gently and
                        mysteriously imparts to human life the distinctive quality which is the
                        exponent of Christian civilization. Upon the receptive nature of children it
                        makes an impress that forever afterward exhales a fragrance and irradiates a
                        glory for the saving of the nations.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret was the humble, self-effacing, never-tiring agent of good in his
                        community. He preached in a tender sing-song voice the sweet monotonies of
                        his creed and the sublime truths of Christ&apos;s code. He was indeed
                        the spiritual father of his people. No wonder Ren&apos;s scowling
                        expression changed to one of abject <pb id="VAA2387-118" n="108"/>
                        self-concern when the priest&apos;s name was suddenly connected with his
                        mood. The confessional loomed up before the eyes of his conscience, and his
                        knees smote together, spiritually if not physically.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now,&quot; said Alice, brusquely, but with sweet and gentle
                        firmness, &quot;go to your <hi rend="i">fiance</hi>, go to pretty and
                        good Adrienne, and ask her to be your <hi rend="i">partenaire.</hi> Refresh
                        your conscience with a noble draught of duty and make that dear little girl
                        overflow with joy. Go, Ren de Ronville.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In making over what she said into English, the translation turns out to be
                        but a sonorous paraphrase. Her French was of that mixed creole sort, a
                        blending of linguistic elegance and <hi rend="i">patois</hi>, impossible to
                        imitate. Like herself it was beautiful, crude, fascinating, and something in
                        it impressed itself as unimpeachable, despite the broken and incongruous
                        diction. Ren felt his soul cowering, even slinking; but he fairly maintained
                        a good face, and went away without saying another word.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Ciel, ciel</hi>, how beautiful she is!&quot; he
                        thought, as he walked along the narrow street in the dreamy sunshine.
                        &quot;But she is not for me, not for me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shook himself and tried to be cheerful. In fact he hummed a creole ditty,
                        something about</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;<hi rend="i">La belle Jeanette, qu&apos; a bris mon

                    <p>Days passed, and at last the time of the great event arrived. It was a frosty
                        night, clear, sparkling with stars, a keen breath cutting down from the
                        northwest. <pb id="VAA2387-119" n="109"/> M. Roussillon, Madame Roussillon,
                        Alice and Lieutenant Beverley went together to the river house, whither they
                        had been preceded by almost the entire population of Vincennes. Some fires
                        had been built outside; the crowd proving too great for the
                        building&apos;s capacity, as there had to be ample space for the
                        dancers. Merry groups hovered around the flaming logs, while within the
                        house a fiddle sang its simple and ravishing tunes. Everybody talked and
                        laughed; it was a lively racket of clashing voices and rhythmical feet.</p>
                    <p>You would have been surprised to find that Oncle Jazon was the fiddler; but
                        there he sat, perched on a high stool in one corner of the large room,
                        sawing away as if for dear life, his head wagging, his elbow leaping back
                        and forth, while his scalpless crown shone like the side of a peeled onion
                        and his puckered mouth wagged grotesquely from side to side keeping time to
                        his tuneful scraping.</p>
                    <p>When the Roussillon party arrived it attracted condensed attention. Its
                        importance, naturally of the greatest in the assembled popular mind, was
                        enhancedas mathematicians would say, to the nth powerby the gown of Alice.
                        It was resplendent indeed in the simple, unaccustomed eyes upon which it
                        flashed with a buff silken glory. Matrons stared at it; maidens gazed with
                        fascinated and jealous vision; men young and old let their eyes take full
                        liberty. It was as if a queen, arrayed in a robe of state, had entered that
                        dingy log edifice, an apparition of dazzling and awe-inspiring beauty. Oncle
                        Jazon caught sight of her, and snapped his tune short off. The dancers swung
                            <pb id="VAA2387-120" n="110"/> together and stopped in confusion. But
                        she, fortified by a woman&apos;s strongest bulwark, the sense of
                        resplendency, appeared quite unconscious of herself.</p>
                    <p>Little Adrienne, hanging in blissful delight upon Ren&apos;s strong arm,
                        felt the stir of excitement and wondered what was the matter, being too
                        short to see over the heads of those around her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it? what is it?&quot; she cried, tiptoeing and tugging
                        at her companion&apos;s sleeve. &quot;Tell me, Ren, tell me, I
                        say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ren was gazing in dumb admiration into which there swept a powerful anger,
                        like a breath of flame. He recollected how Alice had refused to wear that
                        dress when he had asked her, and now she had it on. Moreover, there she
                        stood beside Lieutenant Beverley, holding his arm, looking up into his face,
                        smiling, speaking to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think you might tell me what has happened,&quot; said
                        Adrienne, pouting and still plucking at his arm. &quot;I can&apos;t
                        see a thing, and you won&apos;t tell me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, it&apos;s nothing,&quot; he presently answered, rather
                        fretfully. Then he stooped, lowered his voice and added;
                        &quot;it&apos;s Mademoiselle Roussillon all dressed up like a bride
                        or something. She&apos;s got on a buff silk dress that
                        Mo&apos;sieu&apos; Roussillon&apos;s mother had in
                        France.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How beautiful she must look!&quot; cried the girl. &quot;I
                        wish I could see her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ren put a hand on each side of her slender waist and lifted her high, so that
                        her pretty head rose above the crowding people. Alice chanced to turn her
                        face that way just then and saw the unconventional performance. <pb
                            id="VAA2387-121" n="111"/> Her eyes met those of Adrienne and she gave a
                        nod of smiling recognition. It was a rose beaming upon a gilliflower.</p>
                    <p>M. Roussillon naturally understood that all this stir and crowding to see was
                        but another demonstration of his personal popularity. He bowed and waved a
                        vast hand.</p>
                    <p>But the master of ceremonies called loudly for the dancers to take their
                        places. Oncle Jazon attacked his fiddle again with startling energy. Those
                        who were not to dance formed a compact double line around the wall, the
                        shorter ones in front, the taller in the rear. And what a scene it was! but
                        no person present regarded it as in any way strange or especially
                        picturesque, save as to the gown of Alice, which was now floating and
                        whirling in time to Oncle Jazon&apos;s mad music. The people outside the
                        house cheerfully awaited their turn to go in while an equal number went
                        forth to chat and sing around the fires.</p>
                    <p>Beverley was in a young man&apos;s seventh heaven. The angels formed a
                        choir circling around his heart, and their song brimmed his universe from
                        horizon to horizon.</p>
                    <p>When he called at Roussillon place, and Alice appeared so beautifully and
                        becomingly robed, it was another memorable surprise. She flashed a new and
                        subtly stimulating light upon him. The old gown, rich in subdued splendor of
                        lace and brocade, was ornamented at the throat with a heavy band of pearls,
                        just above which could be seen a trace of the gold chain that supported her
                        portrait locket. There, too, with a <pb id="VAA2387-122" n="112"/> not
                        unbecoming gleam of barbaric colors, shone the string of porcupine beads to
                        which the Indian charm-stone hidden in her bosom was attached. It all
                        harmonized with the time, the place, the atmosphere. Anywhere else it would
                        have been preposterous as a decorative presentment, but here, in this little
                        nook where the <hi rend="i">coureurs de bois</hi>, the half-breeds, the
                        traders and the missionaries had founded a centre of assembly, it was the
                        best possible expression in the life so formed at hap-hazard, and so
                        controlled by the coarsest and narrowest influences. To Fitzhugh Beverley,
                        of Beverley Hall, the picture conveyed immediately a sweet and pervading
                        influence.</p>
                    <p>Alice looked superbly tall, stately and self-possessed in her transforming
                        costume, a woman of full stature, her countenance gravely demure yet
                        reserving near the surface the playful dimples and mischievous smiles so
                        characteristic of her more usual manner. A sudden mood of the <hi rend="i"
                            >varium et mutabile semper femina</hi> had led her to wear the dress,
                        and the mood still illuminated her.</p>
                    <p>Beverley stood before her frankly looking and admiring. The underglow in her
                        cheeks deepened and spread over her perfect throat; her eyes met his a
                        second, then shyly avoided him. He hardly could have been sure which was
                        master, her serenity or her girlish delight in being attractively dressed;
                        but there could be no doubt as to her self-possession; for, saving the
                        pretty blush under his almost rude gaze of admiration, she bore herself as
                        firmly as any fine lady he remembered.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-123" n="113"/>
                    <p>They walked together to the river house, she daintily holding up her skirts,
                        under the insistent verbal direction of Madame Roussillon, and at the same
                        time keeping a light, strangely satisfying touch on his arm. When they
                        entered the room there was no way for Beverley to escape full consciousness
                        of the excitement they aroused; but M. Roussillon&apos;s assumption
                        broke the force of what would have otherwise been extremely embarrassing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is encouraging, very encouraging,&quot; murmured the big man
                        to Beverley in the midst of the staring and scrambling and craning of necks,
                        &quot;to have my people admire and love me so; it goes to the middle of
                        my heart.&quot; And again he bowed and waved his hand with an
                        all-including gesture, while he swept his eyes over the crowd.</p>
                    <p>Alice and Beverley were soon in the whirl of the dance, forgetful of
                        everything but an exhilaration stirred to its utmost by Oncle
                        Jazon&apos;s music.</p>
                    <p>A side remark here may be of interest to those readers who enjoy the dream
                        that on some fortunate day they will invade a lonely nook, where amid dust
                        and cobwebs, neglected because unrecognized, reposes a masterpiece of
                        Stradivari or some other great fiddle-maker. Oncle Jazon knew nothing
                        whatever about old violins. He was a natural musician, that was all, and
                        flung himself upon his fiddle with the same passionate abandon that
                        characterizes a healthy boy&apos;s assault when a plum pudding is at his
                        mercy. But his fiddle was a Carlo Bergonzi; and now let the search be
                        renewed, for the precious instrument was certainly still <pb
                            id="VAA2387-124" n="114"/> in Vincennes as late as 1819, and there is a
                        vague tradition that Governor Whitcomb played on it not long before he died.
                        The mark by which it may be identified is the single word
                        &quot;Jazon&quot; cut in the back of its neck by Oncle Jazon
                        himself.</p>
                    <p>When their dance was ended Alice and Beverley followed the others of their
                        set out into the open air while a fresh stream of eager dancers poured in.
                        Beverley insisted upon wrapping Alice in her mantle of unlined beaver skin
                        against the searching winter breath. They did not go to the fire, but walked
                        back and forth, chatting until their turn to dance should come again,
                        pausing frequently to exchange pleasantries with some of the people.
                        Curiously enough both of them had forgotten the fact that other young men
                        would be sure to ask Alice for a dance, and that more than one pretty creole
                        lass was rightfully expecting a giddy turn with the stalwart and handsome
                        Lieutenant Beverley.</p>
                    <p>Ren de Ronville before long broke rudely into their selfish dream and led
                        Alice into the house. This reminded Beverley of his social duty, wherefore
                        seeing little Adrienne Bourcier he made a rush and secured her at a swoop
                        from the midst of a scrambling circle of mutually hindered young men.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Allons, ma petite!</hi>&quot; he cried, quite in
                        the gay tone of the occasion, and swung her lightly along with him.</p>
                    <p>It was like an eagle dancing with a linnet, or a giant with a fairy, when the
                        big Lieutenant led out <hi rend="i">la petite Adrienne</hi>, as everybody
                        called her. The honor of Beverley&apos;s attention sat unappreciated on
                        Adrienne&apos;s <pb id="VAA2387-125" n="115"/> mind, for all her
                        thoughts went with her eyes toward Ren and Alice. Nor was Beverley so
                        absorbed in his partner&apos;s behalf that he ever for a moment
                        willingly lost sight of the floating buff gown, the shining brown hair and
                        the beautiful face, which formed, indeed, the center of attraction for all
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret was present, sharing heartily in the merriment of his flock.
                        Voices greeted him on all sides with intonations of tender respect. The
                        rudest man there was loyal to the kind-hearted priest, and would as soon
                        have thought of shooting him as of giving him any but the most reverent
                        attention. It is to be noted, however, that their understanding of reverence
                        included great freedom and levity not especially ecclesiastical in its
                        nature. Father Beret understood the conditions around him and had the genius
                        to know what not to hear, what not to see; but he never failed when a good
                        word or a fatherly touch with his hand seemed worth trying on a sheep that
                        appeared to be straying dangerously far from the fold. Upon an occasion like
                        this dance at the river house, he was no less the faithful priest because of
                        his genial sympathy with the happiness of the young people who looked to him
                        for spiritual guidance.</p>
                    <p>It was some time before Beverley could again secure Alice for a dance, and he
                        found it annoying him atrociously to see her smile sweetly on some
                        buckskin-clad lout who looked like an Indian and danced like a Parisian. He
                        did not greatly enjoy most of his partners; they could not appeal to any
                        side of his nature just then. Not that he at all times stood too much <pb
                            id="VAA2387-126" n="116"/> on his aristocratic traditions, or lacked the
                        virile traits common to vigorous and worldly-minded men; but the contrast
                        between Alice and the other girls present was somehow an absolute bar to a
                        democratic freedom of the sort demanded by the occasion. He met Father Beret
                        and passed a few pleasant words with him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They have honored your flag, my son, I am glad to see,&quot;
                        the priest said, pointing with a smile to where, in one corner, the banner
                        that bore Alice&apos;s name was effectively draped.</p>
                    <p>Beverley had not noticed it before, and when he presently got possession of
                        Alice he asked her to tell him the story of how she planted it on the fort,
                        although he had heard it to the last detail from Father Beret just a moment
                        ago. They stood together under its folds while she nively sketched the scene
                        for him, even down to her picturesquely disagreeable interview with
                        Long-Hair, mention of whom led up to the story of the Indian&apos;s race
                        with the stolen <hi rend="i">dame jeanne</hi> of brandy under his arm on
                        that memorable night, and the subsequent services performed for him by
                        Father Beret and her, after she and Jean had found him in the mud beyond the
                        river.</p>
                    <p>The dancing went on at a furious pace while they stood there. Now and again a
                        youth came to claim her, but she said she was tired and begged to rest
                        awhile, smiling so graciously upon each one that his rebuff thrilled him as
                        if it had been the most flattering gift of tender partiality, while at the
                        same time he suspected that it was all for Beverley.</p>
                    <p>Helm in his most jovial mood was circulating freely <pb id="VAA2387-127"
                            n="117"/> among those who formed the periphery of the dancing-area; he
                        even ventured a few clumsy capers in a cotillion with Madame Godre for
                        partner. She danced well; but he, as someone remarked, stumbled all over
                        himself.</p>
                    <p>There was but one thing to mar the evening&apos;s pleasure: some of the
                        men drank too much and grew boisterous. A quarrel ended in a noisy but
                        harmless fight near one of the fires. M. Roussillon rushed to the spot,
                        seized the combatants, tousled them playfully, as if they had been children,
                        rubbed their heads together, laughed stormily and so restored the
                        equilibrium of temper.</p>
                    <p>It was late when fathers and mothers in the company began to suggest
                        adjournment. Oncle Jazon&apos;s elbow was tired and the enthusiasm
                        generated by his unrecognized Bergonzi became fitful, while the relaxing
                        crowd rapidly encroached upon the space set apart for the dancers. In the
                        open lamps suspended here and there the oil was running low, and the rag
                        wicks sputtered and winked with their yellow flames.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said M. Roussillon, coming to where Alice and
                        Beverley stood insulated and isolated by their great delight in each
                        other&apos;s company, &quot;it&apos;s time to go home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley looked at his watch; it was a quarter to three!</p>
                    <p>Alice also looked at the watch, and saw engraved and enameled on its massive
                        case the Beverley crest, but she did not know what it meant. There was
                        something of the sort in the back of her locket, she remembered with
                        satisfaction.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-128" n="118"/>
                    <p>Just then there was a peculiar stir in the flagging crowd. Someone had
                        arrived, a <hi rend="i">coureur de bois</hi> from the north. Where was the
                        commandant? the <hi rend="i">coureur</hi> had something important for him.</p>
                    <p>Beverley heard a remark in a startled voice about the English getting ready
                        for a descent upon the Wabash valley. This broke the charm which thralled
                        him and sent through his nerves the bracing shock that only a soldier can
                        feel when a hint of coming battle reaches him.</p>
                    <p>Alice saw the flash in his face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is Captain Helm? I must see him immediately. Excuse
                        me,&quot; he said, abruptly turning away and looking over the heads of
                        the people; &quot;yonder he is, I must go to him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="i">coureur de bois</hi>, Adolphe Dutremble by name, was just
                        from the head waters of the Wabash. He was speaking to Helm when Beverley
                        came up. M. Roussillon followed close upon the Lieutenant&apos;s heels,
                        as eager as he to know what the message amounted to; but Helm took the <hi
                            rend="i">coureur</hi> aside, motioning Beverley to join them. M.
                        Roussillon included himself in the conference.</p>
                    <p>After all it was but the gossip of savages that Dutremble communicated; still
                        the purport was startling in the extreme. Governor Hamilton, so the story
                        ran, had been organizing a large force; he was probably now on his way to
                        the portage of the Wabash with a flotilla of batteaux, some companies of
                        disciplined soldiers, artillery and a strong body of Indians.</p>
                    <p>Helm listened attentively to Dutremble&apos;s lively <pb id="VAA2387-129"
                            n="119"/> sketch, then cross-questioned him with laconic directness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Send Mr. Jazon to me,&quot; he said to M. Roussillon, as if
                        speaking to a servant.</p>
                    <p>The master Frenchman went promptly, recognizing Captain Helm&apos;s right
                        to command, and sympathizing with his unpleasant military predicament if the
                        news should prove true.</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon came in a minute, his fiddle and bow clamped under his arm, to
                        receive a verbal commission, which sent him with some scouts of his own
                        choosing forthwith to the Wabash portage, or far enough to ascertain what
                        the English commander was doing.</p>
                    <p>After the conference Beverley made haste to join Alice; but he found that she
                        had gone home.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One hell of a fix we&apos;ll be in if Hamilton comes down here
                        with a good force,&quot; said Helm.</p>
                    <p>Beverley felt like retorting that a little forethought, zeal and preparation
                        might have lessened the prospective gloom. He had been troubled all the time
                        about Helm&apos;s utter lack of military precaution. True, there was
                        very little material out of which that optimistic officer could have formed
                        a body of resistance against the army probably at Hamilton&apos;s
                        command; but Beverley was young, energetic, bellicose, and to him everything
                        seemed possible; he believed in vigilance, discipline, activity, dash; he
                        had a great faith in the efficacy of enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p>`We must organize these Frenchmen,&quot; he said; &quot;they will
                        make good fighters if we can once get them to act as a body.
                        There&apos;s no time to be lost; but we <pb id="VAA2387-130" n="120"/>
                        have time enough in which to do a great deal before Hamilton can arrive, if
                        we go at it in earnest.&quot;</p>
                    <p>`Your theory is excellent, Lieutenant, but the practice of it won&apos;t
                        be worth a damn,&quot; Helm replied with perfect good nature.
                        &quot;I&apos;d like to see you organize these parly-voos. There
                        ain&apos;t a dozen of &apos;em that wouldn&apos;t accept the
                        English with open arms. I know &apos;em. They&apos;re good hearted,
                        polite and all that; they&apos;ll hurrah for the flag; that&apos;s
                        easy enough; but put &apos;em to the test and they&apos;ll join in
                        with the strongest side, see if they don&apos;t. Of course there are a
                        few exceptions. There&apos;s Jazon, he&apos;s all right, and I have
                        faith in Bosseron, and Legrace, and young Ronville.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Roussillon&quot; Beverley began.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is much of a blow-hard,&quot; Helm interrupted with a laugh.
                        &quot;Barks loud, but his biting disposition is probably not
                        vicious.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He and Father Beret control the whole population at all
                        events,&quot; said Beverley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, and such a population!&quot;</p>
                    <p>While joining in Captain Helm&apos;s laugh at the expense of Vincennes,
                        Beverley took leave to indulge a mental reservation in favor of Alice. He
                        could not bear to class her with the crowd of noisy, thoughtless, mercurial
                        beings whom he heard still singing gay snatches and calling to one another
                        from distance to distance, as they strolled homeward in groups and pairs.
                        Nor could the impending danger of an enforced surrender to the English and
                        Indians drive from his mind her beautiful image, while he lay for the rest
                        of the night between sleeping and waking on his primitive <pb
                            id="VAA2387-131" n="121"/> bed, alternately hearing over again her every
                        phrase and laugh, and striving to formulate some definite plan for defending
                        the town and fort. His heart was full of her. She had surprised his nature
                        and filled it, as with a wonderful, haunting song. His youth, his
                        imagination, all that was fresh and spontaneously gentle and natural in him,
                        was flooded with the magnetic splendor of her beauty. And yet, in his pride
                        (and it was not a false pride, but rather a noble regard for his birthright)
                        he vaguely realized how far she was from him, how impossible.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE DILEMMA OF CAPTAIN HELM</head>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon, feeling like a fish returned to the water after a long and
                        torturing captivity in the open air, plunged into the forest with
                        anticipations of lively adventure and made his way toward the Wea plains. It
                        was his purpose to get a boat at the village of Ouiatenon and pull thence up
                        the Wabash until he could find out what the English were doing. He chose for
                        his companions on this dangerous expedition two expert <hi rend="i">coureurs
                            de bois</hi>, Dutremble and Jacques Bailoup. Fifty miles up the river
                        they fell in with some friendly Indians, well known to them all, who were
                        returning from the portage.</p>
                    <p>The savages informed them that there were no signs of an English advance in
                        that quarter. Some of them had been as far as the St. Joseph river and to
                        within a short distance of Detroit without seeing a white man or hearing of
                        any suspicious movements on the part of Hamilton. So back came Oncle Jazon
                        with his pleasing report, much disappointed that he had not been able to
                        stir up some sort of trouble.</p>
                    <p>It was Helm&apos;s turn to laugh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What did I tell you?&quot; he cried, in a jolly mood, slapping
                        Beverley on the shoulder. &quot;I knew mighty well that it was all a big
                        story with nothing in it. What on earth would the English be thinking about
                        to march an army away off down here only to capture <pb id="VAA2387-133"
                            n="123"/> a rotten stockade and a lot of gabbling parly-voos?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley, while he did not feel quite as confident as his chief, was not
                        sorry that things looked a little brighter than he had feared they would
                        turn out to be. Secretly, and without acknowledging it to himself, he was
                        delighted with the life he was living. The Arcadian atmosphere of Vincennes
                        clothed him in its mists and dreams. No matter what way the weather blew its
                        breath, cold or warm, cloudy or fair, rain or snow, the peace in his soul
                        changed not. His nature seemed to hold all of its sterner and fiercer traits
                        in abeyance while he domiciled himself absolutely within his narrow and
                        monotonous environment. Since the dance at the river house a new content,
                        like a soft and diffused sweetness, had crept through his blood with a
                        vague, tingling sense of joy.</p>
                    <p>He began to like walking about rather aimlessly in the town&apos;s narrow
                        streets, with the mud-daubed cabins on either hand. This simple life under
                        low, thatched roofs had a charm. When a door was opened he could see a fire
                        of logs on the ample hearth shooting its yellow tongues up the sooty
                        chimney-throat. Soft creole voices murmured and sang, or jangled their petty
                        domestic discords. Women in scant petticoats, leggings and moccasins swept
                        snow from the squat verandas, or fed the pigs in little sties behind the
                        cabins. Everybody cried cheerily: &quot;<hi rend="i">Bon jour, Monsieur,
                            comment allez-vous?</hi>&quot; as he went by, always accompanying
                        the verbal salute with a graceful wave of the hand.</p>
                    <p>When he walked early in the morning a waft of <pb id="VAA2387-134" n="124"/>
                        broiling game and browning corn scones was abroad. Pots and kettles occupied
                        the hearths with glowing coals heaped around and under. Shaggy dogs whined
                        at the doors until the mensal remnants were tossed out to them in the front
                        yard.</p>
                    <p>But it was always a glimpse of Alice that must count for everything in
                        Beverley&apos;s reckonings, albeit he would have strenuously denied it.
                        True he went to Roussillon place almost every day, it being a fixed part of
                        his well ordered habit, and had a talk with her. Sometimes, when Dame
                        Roussillon was very busy and so quite off her guard, they read together in a
                        novel, or in certain parts of the odd volume of Montaigne. This was done
                        more for the sweetness of disobedience than to enjoy the already familiar
                        pages.</p>
                    <p>Now and again they repeated their fencing bout; but never with the result
                        which followed the first. Beverley soon mastered Alice&apos;s tricks and
                        showed her that, after all, masculine muscle is not to be discounted at its
                        own game by even the most wonderful womanly strength and suppleness. She
                        struggled bravely to hold her vantage ground once gained so easily, but the
                        inevitable was not to be avoided. At last, one howling winter day, he
                        disarmed her by the very trick that she had shown him. That ended the play
                        and they ran shivering into the house.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah,&quot; she cried, &quot;it isn&apos;t fair. You are
                        so much bigger than I; you have so much longer arms; so much more weight and
                        power. It all counts against me! You ought to be ashamed of
                        yourself!&quot; She was rosy <pb id="VAA2387-135" n="125"/> with the
                        exhilarating exercise and the biting of the frosty breeze. Her beauty gave
                        forth a new ray.</p>
                    <p>Deep in her heart she was pleased to have him master her so superbly; but as
                        the days passed she never said so, never gave over trying to make him feel
                        the touch of her foil. She did not know that her eyes were getting through
                        his guard, that her dimples were stabbing his heart to its middle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have other advantages,&quot; he replied, &quot;which
                        far overbalance my greater stature and stronger muscles.&quot; Then
                        after a pause he added: &quot;After all a girl must be a girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Something in his face, something in her heart, startled her so that she made
                        a quick little move like that of a restless bird.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are beautiful and that makes my eyes and my hand
                        uncertain,&quot; he went on. &quot;Were I fencing with a man there
                        would be no glamour.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He spoke in English, which he did not often do in conversation with her. It
                        was a sign that he was somewhat wrought upon. She followed his rapid words
                        with difficulty; but she caught from them a new note of feeling. He saw a
                        little pale flare shoot across her face and thought she was angry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You should not use your dimples to distract my vision,&quot; he
                        quickly added, with a light laugh. &quot;It would be no worse for me to
                        throw my hat in your face!&quot;</p>
                    <p>His attempt at levity was obviously weak; she looked straight into his eyes,
                        with the steady gaze of a simple, earnest nature shocked by a current quite
                            <pb id="VAA2387-136" n="126"/> strange to it. She did not understand
                        him, and she did. Her fine intuition gathered swiftly together a hundred
                        shreds of impression received from him during their recent growing intimacy.
                        He was a patrician, as she vaguely made him out, a man of wealth, whose
                        family was great. He belonged among people of gentle birth and high
                        attainments. She magnified him so that he was diffused in her imagination,
                        as difficult to comprehend as a mist in the morning airand as beautiful.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You make fun of me,&quot; she said, very deliberately, letting
                        her eyes droop; then she looked up again suddenly and continued, with a
                        certain nive expression of disappointment gathering in her face. &quot;I
                        have been too free with you. Father Beret told me not to forget my dignity
                        when in your company. He told me you might misunderstand me. I
                        don&apos;t care; I shall not fence with you again.&quot; She
                        laughed, but there was no joyous freedom in the sound.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Alicemy dear Miss Roussillon, you do me a wrong; I beg a
                        thousand pardons if I&apos;ve hurt you,&quot; he cried, stepping
                        nearer to her, &quot;and I can never for-give myself. You have somehow
                        misunderstood me, I know you have!&quot;</p>
                    <p>On his part it was exaggerating a mere contact of mutual feelings into a
                        dangerous collision. He was as much self-deceived as was she, and he made
                        more noise about it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is you who have misunderstood me,&quot; she replied, smiling
                        brightly now, but with just a faint, pitiful touch of regret, or self-blame
                        lingering in her voice. <pb id="VAA2387-137" n="127"/> &quot;Father
                        Beret said you would. I did not believe him; but&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you shall not believe him,&quot; said Beverley. &quot;I
                        have not misunderstood you. There has been nothing. You have treated me
                        kindly and with beautiful friendliness. You have not done or said a thing
                        that Father Beret or anybody else could criticise. And if I have said or
                        done the least thing to trouble you I repudiate itI did not mean it. Now you
                        believe me, don&apos;t you, Miss Roussillon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He seemed to be falling into the habit of speaking to her in English. She
                        understood it somewhat imperfectly, especially when in an earnest moment he
                        rushed his words together as if they had been soldiers he was leading at the
                        charge-step against an enemy. His manner convinced her, even though his
                        diction fell short.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then we&apos;ll talk about something else,&quot; she said,
                        laughing naturally now, and retreating to a chair by the hearthside.
                        &quot;I want you to tell me all about yourself and your family, your
                        home and everything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She seated herself with an air of conscious aplomb and motioned him to take a
                        distant stool.</p>
                    <p>There was a great heap of dry logs in the fireplace, with pointed flames
                        shooting out of its crevices and leaping into the gloomy, cave-like throat
                        of the flue. Outside a wind passed heavily across the roof and bellowed in
                        the chimney-top.</p>
                    <p>Beverley drew the stool near Alice, who, with a charred stick, used as a
                        poker, was thrusting at the glowing crevices and sending showers of sparks
                        aloft.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, there wouldn&apos;t be much to tell,&quot; he said,
                            <pb id="VAA2387-138" n="128"/> glad to feel secure again. &quot;Our
                        home is a big old mansion named Beverley Hall on a hill among trees, and
                        half surrounded with slave cabins. It overlooks the plantation in the valley
                        where a little river goes wandering on its way.&quot; He was speaking
                        French and she followed him easily now, her eyes beginning to fling out
                        again their natural sunny beams of interest. &quot;I was born there
                        twenty-six years ago and haven&apos;t done much of anything since. You
                        see before you, Mademoiselle, a very undistinguished young man, who has
                        signally failed to accomplish the dream of his boyhood, which was to be a
                        great artist like Raphael or Angelo. Instead of being famous I am but a poor
                        Lieutenant in the forces of Virginia.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have a mother, father, brothers and sisters?&quot; she
                        interrogated. She did not understand his allusion to the great artists of
                        whom she knew nothing. She had never before heard of them. She leaned the
                        poker against the chimney jamb and turned her face toward him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mother, father, and one sister,&quot; he said, &quot;no
                        brothers. We were a happy little group. But my sister married and lives in
                        Baltimore. I am here. Father and mother are alone in the old house.
                        Sometimes I am terribly homesick.&quot; He was silent a moment, then
                        added: &quot;But you are selfish, you make me do all the telling. Now I
                        want you to give me a little of your story, Mademoiselle, beginning as I
                        did, at the first.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I can&apos;t,&quot; she replied with childlike
                        frankness, &quot;for I don&apos;t know where I was born, nor my
                        parents&apos; names, nor who I am. You see how different it is <pb
                            id="VAA2387-139" n="129"/> with me. I am called Alice Roussillon, but I
                        suppose that my name is Alice Tarleton; it is not certain, however. There is
                        very little to help out the theory. Here is all the proof there is. I
                        don&apos;t know that it is worth anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She took off her locket and handed it to him.</p>
                    <p>He handled it rather indifferently, for he was just then studying the fine
                        lines of her face. But in a moment he was interested.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tarleton, Tarleton,&quot; he repeated. Then he turned the
                        little disc of gold over and saw the enameled drawing on the back,a crest
                        clearly outlined.</p>
                    <p>He started. The crest was quite familiar.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where did you get this?&quot; he demanded in English, and with
                        such blunt suddenness that she was startled. &quot;Where did it come
                        from?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have always had it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Always? It&apos;s the Tarleton crest. Do you belong to that
                        family?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed I do not know. Papa Roussillon says he thinks I
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, this is strange and interesting,&quot; said Beverley,
                        rather to himself than addressing her. He looked from the miniature to the
                        crest and back to the miniature again, then at Alice. &quot;I tell you
                        this is strange,&quot; he repeated with emphasis. &quot;It is
                        exceedingly strange.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her cheeks flushed quickly under their soft brown, and her eyes flashed with
                        excitement.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I know.&quot; Her voice fluttered; her hands were clasped
                        in her lap. She leaned toward him eagerly. &quot;It is strange.
                        I&apos;ve thought about it a great deal.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-140" n="130"/>
                    <p>&quot;Alice Tarleton; that is right; Alice is a name of the family. Lady
                        Alice Tarleton was the mother of the first Sir Garnett Tarleton who came
                        over in the time of Yardley. It&apos;s a great family. One of the oldest
                        and best in Virginia.&quot; He looked at her now with a gaze of
                        concentrated interest, under which her eyes fell. &quot;Why, this is
                        romantic!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;absolutely romantic. And you
                        don&apos;t know how you came by this locket? You don&apos;t know who
                        was your father, your mother?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not know anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what does Monsieur Roussillon know?&apos;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just as little.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But how came he to be taking you and caring for you? He must know
                        how he got you, where he got you, of whom he got you? Surely he
                        knows&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I know all that. I was twelve years old when Papa Roussillon
                        took me, eight years ago. I had been having a hard life, and but for him I
                        must have died. I was a captive among the Indians. He took me and has cared
                        for me and taught me. He has been very, very good to me. I love him
                        dearly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And don&apos;t you remember anything at all about when, where,
                        how the Indians got you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot; She shook her head and seemed to be trying to
                        recollect something. &quot;No, I just can&apos;t remember; and yet
                        there has always been something like a dream in my mind, which I could not
                        quite get hold of. I know that I am not a Catholic. I vaguely remember a
                        sweet woman who taught me to pray like this: &quot;Our Father who art in
                        heaven, hallowed be Thy name.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-141" n="[]"/>
                    <figure entity="VAA2387-4">
                        <p>He was just then studying the fine lines of her face p. 129.</p>
                    </figure>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-142" n="131"/>
                    <p>And Alice went on through the beautiful and perfect prayer, which she
                        repeated in English with infinite sweetness and solemnity, her eyes
                        uplifted, her hands clasped before her. Beverley could have sworn that she
                        was a shining saint, and that he saw an aureole.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; she continued, &quot;that sometime,
                        somewhere, to a very dear person I promised that I never, never, never would
                        pray any prayer but that. And I remember almost nothing else about that
                        other life, which is far off back yonder in the past, I don&apos;t know
                        where,sweet, peaceful, shadowy; a dream that I have all but lost from my
                        mind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley&apos;s sympathy was deeply moved. He sat for some minutes
                        looking at her without speaking. She, too, was pensive and silent, while the
                        fire sputtered and sang, the great logs slowly melting, the flames tossing
                        wisps of smoke into the chimney still booming to the wind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know, too, that I am not French,&quot; she presently resumed,
                        &quot;but I don&apos;t know just how I know it. My first words must
                        have been English, for I have always dreamed of talking in that language,
                        and my dimmest half recollections of the old days are of a large, white
                        house, and a soft-voiced black woman, who sang to me in that language the
                        very sweetest songs in the world.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It must be borne in mind that all this was told by Alice in her creole
                        French, half bookish, half <hi rend="i">patois</hi>, of which no translation
                        can give any fair impression.</p>
                    <p>Beverley listened, as one who hears a clever reader intoning a strange and
                        captivating poem. He was charmed. His imagination welcomed the story and <pb
                            id="VAA2387-143" n="132"/> furnished it with all that it lacked of
                        picturesque completeness. In those days it was no uncommon thing for a white
                        child to be found among the Indians with not a trace left by which to
                        restore it to its people. He had often heard of such a case. But here was
                        Alice right before him, the most beautiful girl that he had ever seen,
                        telling him the strangest story of all. To his mind it was clear that she
                        belonged to the Tarleton family of Virginia. Youth always concludes a matter
                        at once. He knew some of the Tarletons; but it was a widely scattered
                        family, its members living in almost every colony in America. The crest he
                        recognized at a glance by the dragon on the helmet with three stars. It was
                        not for a woman to bear; but doubtless it had been enameled on the locket
                        merely as a family mark, as was often done in America.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The black woman was your nurse, your mammy,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;I know by that and by your prayer in English, as well as by your
                        locket, that you are of a good old family.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Like most Southerners, he had strong faith in genealogy, and he held at his
                        tongue&apos;s tip the names of all the old families. The Carters, the
                        Blairs, the Fitzhughs, the Hansons, the Randolphs, the Lees, the Ludwells,
                        the Joneses, the Beverleys, the Tarletonsa whole catalogue of them stretched
                        back in his memory. He knew the coat of arms displayed by each house. He
                        could repeat their legends.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish you could tell me more,&quot; he went on.
                        &quot;Can&apos;t you recollect anything further about your early
                        childhood, your first impressionsthe house, the woman <pb id="VAA2387-144"
                            n="133"/> who taught you to pray, the old black mammy? Any little thing
                        might be of priceless value as evidence.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice shrugged her shoulders after the creole fashion with something of her
                        habitual levity of manner, and laughed. His earnestness seemed
                        disproportioned to the subject, as she fancied he must view it, although to
                        her it had always been something to dream over. It was impossible for her to
                        realize, as he did, the importance of details in solving a problem like that
                        involved in her past history. Nor could she feel the pathos and almost
                        tragic fascination with which her story had touched him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is absolutely nothing more to tell,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;All my life I have tried to remember more, but it&apos;s
                        impossible; I can&apos;t get any further back or call up another thing.
                        There&apos;s no use trying. It&apos;s all like a dreamprobably it is
                        one. I do have such dreams. In my sleep I can lift myself into the air, just
                        as easy, and fly back to the same big white house that I seem to remember.
                        When you told me about your home it was like something that I had often seen
                        before. I shall be dreaming about it next!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley cross-questioned her from every possible point of view; he was
                        fascinated with the mystery; but she gave him nothing out of which the least
                        further light could be drawn. A half-breed woman, it seemed, had been her
                        Indian foster-mother; a silent, grave, watchful guardian from whom not a
                        hint of disclosure ever fell. She was, moreover, a Christian woman, who had
                        received her conversion from an English-speaking <pb id="VAA2387-145"
                            n="134"/> Protestant missionary. She praved with Alice, thus keeping in
                        the child&apos;s mind a perfect memory of the Lord&apos;s prayer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Beverley at last, &quot;you are more of a
                        mystery to me, the longer I know you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then I must grow every day more distasteful to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I love mystery.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He went away feeling a new web of interest binding him to this inscrutable
                        maiden whose life seemed to him at once so full of idyllic happiness and so
                        enshrouded in tantalizing doubt. At the first opportunity he frankly
                        questioned M. Roussillon, with no helpful result. The big Frenchman told the
                        same meager story. The woman was dying in the time of a great epidemic,
                        which killed most of her tribe. She gave Alice to M. Roussillon, but told
                        him not a word about her ancestry or previous life. That was all.</p>
                    <p>A wise old man, when he finds himself in a blind alley, no sooner touches the
                        terminal wall than he faces about and goes back the way he came. Under like
                        circumstances a young man must needs try to batter the wall down with his
                        head. Beverley endeavored to break through the web of mystery by sheer
                        force. It seemed to him that a vigorous attempt could not fail to succeed;
                        but, like the fly in the spider&apos;s lines, he became more hopelessly
                        bound at every move he made. Moreover against his will he was realizing that
                        he could no longer deceive himself about Alice. He loved her, and the love
                        was mastering him body and soul. Such a confession carries with it into an
                        honest masculine <pb id="VAA2387-146" n="135"/> heart a sense of contending
                        responsibilities. In Beverley&apos;s case the clash was profoundly
                        disturbing. And now he clutched the thought that Alice was not a mere child
                        of the woods, but a daughter of an old family of cavaliers!</p>
                    <p>With coat buttoned close against the driving wind, he strode toward the fort
                        in one of those melodramatic moods to which youth in all climes and times is
                        subject. It was like a slap in the face when Captain Helm met him at the
                        stockade gate and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, sir, you are good at hiding.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hiding! what do you mean, Captain Helm?&quot; he demanded, not
                        in the mildest tone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean, sir, that I&apos;ve been hunting you for an hour and
                        more, over the whole of this damned town. The English and Indians are upon
                        us, and there&apos;s no time for fooling. Where are all the
                        men?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley comprehended the situation in a second. Helm&apos;s face was
                        congested with excitement. Some scouts had come in with the news that
                        Governor Hamilton, at the head of five or six hundred soldiers and Indians,
                        was only three or four miles up the river.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where are all the men?&quot; Helm repeated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Buffalo hunting, most of them,&quot; said Beverley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What in hell are they off hunting buffaloes for?&quot; raged
                        the excited captain.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You might go to hell and see,&quot; Beverley suggested, and
                        they both laughed in sheer masculine contempt of a predicament too grave for
                        anything but grim mirth.</p>
                    <p>What could they do? Even Oncle Jazon and Ren de Ronville were off with the
                        hunters. Helm sent <pb id="VAA2387-147" n="136"/> for M. Roussillon in the
                        desperate hope that he could suggest something; but he lost his head and
                        hustled off to hide his money and valuables. Indeed the French people all
                        felt that, so far as they were concerned, the chief thing was to save what
                        they had. They well knew that it mattered little which of the two masters
                        held over themthey must shift for themselves. In their hearts they were true
                        to France and America; but France and America could not now protect them
                        against Hamilton; therefore it would be like suicide to magnify patriotism
                        or any other sentiment objectionable to the English. So they acted upon M.
                        Roussillon&apos;s advice and offered no resistance when the new army
                        approached.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My poor people are not disloyal to your flag and your
                        cause,&quot; said good Father Beret next morning to Captain Helm,
                        &quot;but they are powerless. Winter is upon us. What would you have us
                        do? This rickety fort is not available for defense; the men are nearly all
                        far away on the plains. Isn&apos;t it the part of prudence and common
                        sense to make the best of a desperate situation? Should we resist, the
                        British and their savage allies would destroy the town and commit outrages
                        too horrible to think about. In this case diplomacy promises much more than
                        a hopeless fight against an overwhelming force.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll fight &apos;em,&quot; Helm ground out between
                        his teeth, &quot;if I have to do it single-handed and alone!
                        I&apos;ll fight &apos;em till hell freezes over!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret smiled grimly, as if he, too, would enjoy a lively skirmish on
                        the ice of Tophet, and said:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-148" n="137"/>
                    <p>&quot;I admire your courage, my son. Fighting is perfectly proper upon
                        fair occasion. But think of the poor women and children. These old eyes of
                        mine have seen some terrible things done by enraged savages. Men can die
                        fighting; but their poor wives and daughtersah, I have seen, I have
                        seen!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley felt a pang of terror shoot through his heart as Father
                        Beret&apos;s simple words made him think of Alice in connection with an
                        Indian massacre.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, of course it&apos;s horrible to think of,&quot;
                        said Helm; &quot;but my duty is clear, and that flag,&quot; he
                        pointed to where <hi rend="i">la bannire d&apos;Alice Roussillon</hi>
                        was almost blowing away in the cold wind, &quot;that flag shall not come
                        down save in full honor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His speech sounded preposterously boastful and hollow; but he was manfully in
                        earnest; every word came from his brave heart.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret&apos;s grim smile returned, lighting up his strongly marked
                        face with the strangest expression imaginable.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We will get all the women inside the fort,&quot; Helm began to
                        say.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where the Indians will find them ready penned up and at their
                        mercy,&quot; quickly interpolated the priest. &quot;That will not
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, what can be done?&quot; Beverley demanded, turning
                        with a fierce stare upon Father Beret. &quot;Don&apos;t stand there
                        objecting to everything, with not a suggestion of your own to
                        offer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know what is best for my people,&quot; the old man replied
                        softly, still smiling. &quot;I have advised them to <pb id="VAA2387-149"
                            n="138"/> stay inside their houses and take no part in the military
                        event. It is the only hope of averting an indiscriminate massacre, and
                        things worse.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The curt phrase, &quot;things worse,&quot; went like a bullet-stroke
                        through Beverley&apos;s heart. It flashed an awful picture upon his
                        vision. Father Beret saw his face whiten and his lips set themselves to
                        resist a great emotion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do not be angry with me, my son,&quot; he said, laying a hand
                        on the young man&apos;s arm. &quot;I may be wrong, but I act upon
                        long and convincing experience.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Experience or no experience,&quot; Helm exclaimed with an oath,
                        &quot;this fort must be manned and defended. I am commanding
                        here!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I recognize your authority,&quot; responded the priest in
                        a firm yet deferential tone, &quot;and I heartily wish you had a
                        garrison; but where is your command, Captain Helm?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then it was that the doughty Captain let loose the accumulated profanity with
                        which he had been for some time well-nigh bursting. He tiptoed in order to
                        curse with extremest violence. His gestures were threatening. He shook his
                        fists at Father Beret, without really meaning offence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is my garrison, you ask! Yes, and I can tell you.
                        It&apos;s where you might expect a gang of dad blasted jabbering French
                        good-for-nothings to be, off high-gannicking around shooting buffaloes
                        instead of staying here and defending their wives, children, homes and
                        country, damn their everlasting souls! The few I have in the fort will sneak
                        off, I suppose.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-150" n="139"/>
                    <p>&quot;The French gave you this post on easy terms, Captain,&quot;
                        blandly retorted Father Beret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, and they&apos;ll hand it over to Hamilton, you think, on
                        the same basis,&quot; cried Helm, &quot;but I&apos;ll show you!
                        I&apos;ll show you, Mr. Priest!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pardon me, Captain, the French are loyal to you and to the flag
                        yonder. They have sworn it. Time will prove it. But in the present desperate
                        dilemma we must choose the safer horn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Saying this Father Beret turned about and went his way. He was chuckling
                        heartily as he passed out of the gate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is right,&quot; said Beverley after a few moments of
                        reflection, during which he was wholly occupied with Alice, whose terrified
                        face in his anticipation appealed to him from the midst of howling savages,
                        smoking cabins and mangled victims of lust and massacre. His imagination
                        painted the scene with a merciless realism that chilled his blood. All the
                        sweet romance fell away from Vincennes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, sir, right or wrong, your duty is to obey orders,&quot;
                        said Helm with brutal severity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We had better not quarrel, Captain,&quot; Beverley replied.
                        &quot;I have not signified any unwillingness to obey your commands. Give
                        them, and you will have no cause to grumble.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Forgive me, old fellow,&quot; cried the impulsive commander.
                        &quot;I know you are true as steel. I s&apos;pose I&apos;m wound
                        up too tight to be polite. But the time is come to do something. Here we are
                        with but five or six men&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-151" n="140"/>
                    <p>He was interrupted by the arrival of two more half-breed scouts.</p>
                    <p>Only three miles away was a large flotilla of boats and canoes with cannon, a
                        force of Indians on land and the British flag flying,that was the report.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They are moving rapidly,&quot; said the spokesman,
                        &quot;and will be here very soon. They are at least six hundred strong,
                        all well armed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Push that gun to the gate, and load it to the muzzle, Lieutenant
                        Beverley,&quot; Helm ordered with admirable firmness, the purple flush
                        in his face giving way to a grayish pallor. &quot;We are going to die
                        right here, or have the honors of war.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley obeyed without a word. He even loaded two guns instead of
                        onecharging each so heavily that the last wad looked as if ready to leap
                        from the grimy mouth.</p>
                    <p>Helm had already begun, on receiving the first report, a hasty letter to
                        Colonel Clark at Kaskaskia. He now added a few words and at the last moment
                        sent it out by a trusted man, who was promptly captured by
                        Hamilton&apos;s advance guard. The missive, evidently written in
                        installments during the slow approach of the British, is still in the
                        Canadian archives, and runs thus: <text>

                                    <p>&quot;Dear SirAt this time there is an army within three
                                        miles of this place; I heard of their coming several days
                                        beforehand. I sent spies to find the certaintythe spies
                                        being taken prisoner I never got intelligence till they got
                                        within three miles of town. As I had called the militia and
                                        had all assurances of <pb id="VAA2387-152" n="141"/> their
                                        integrity I ordered at the firing of a cannon every man to
                                        appear, but I saw but few. Captain Buseron behaved much to
                                        his honor and credit, but I doubt the conduct of a certain
                                        gent. Excuse haste, as the army is in sight. My
                                        determination is to defend the garrison, (sic) though I have
                                        but twenty-one men but what has left me. I refer you to Mr.
                                        Wmes (sic) for the rest. The army is within three hundred
                                        yards of the village. You must think how I feel; not four
                                        men that I really depend upon; but am determined to act

                                        defend the town, as not one of the militia will take arms,
                                        though before sight of the army no braver men. There is a
                                        flag at a small distance, I must conclude.</p>

                    <p>Having completed this task, the letter shows under what a nervous strain,
                        Helm turned to his lieutenant and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fire a swivel with a blank charge. We&apos;ll give these
                        weak-kneed parly-voos one more call to duty. Of course not a frog-eater of
                        them all will come. But I said that a gun should be the signal. Possibly
                        they didn&apos;t hear the first one, the damned, deaf, cowardly
                        hounds!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley wheeled forth the swivel and rammed a charge of powder home. But
                        when he fired it, the effect was far from what it should have been. Instead
                        of calling in a fresh body of militia, it actually drove <pb

                        remained as a garrison; so that Captain Helm and his Lieutenant found
                        themselves quite alone in the fort, while out before the gate, deployed in
                        fine open order, a strong line of British soldiers approached with sturdy
                        steps, led by a tall, erect, ruddy-faced young officer.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE HONORS OF WAR</head>
                    <p>Gaspard Roussillon was thoroughly acquainted with savage warfare, and he knew
                        all the pacific means so successfully and so long used by French
                        missionaries and traders to control savage character; but the emergency now
                        upon him was startling. It confused him. The fact that he had taken a solemn
                        oath of allegiance to the American government could have been pushed aside
                        lightly enough upon pressing occasion, but he knew that certain confidential
                        agents left in Vincennes by Governor Abbott had, upon the arrival of Helm,
                        gone to Detroit, and of course they had carried thither a full report of all
                        that happened in the church of St. Xavier, when Father Gibault called the
                        people together, and at the fort, when the British flag was hauled down and
                            <hi rend="i">la bannire d&apos;Alice Roussillon</hi> run up in its
                        place. His expansive imagination did full credit to itself in exaggerating
                        the importance of his part in handing the post over to the rebels. And what
                        would Hamilton think of this? Would he consider it treason? The question
                        certainly bore a tragic suggestion.</p>
                    <p>M. Roussillon lacked everything of being a coward, and treachery had no
                        rightful place in his nature. He was, however, so in the habit of fighting
                        windmills and making mountains of molehills that he could <pb
                            id="VAA2387-155" n="144"/> not at first glance see any sudden
                        presentment with a normal vision. He had no love for Englishmen and he did
                        like Americans, but he naturally thought that Helm&apos;s talk of
                        fighting Hamilton was, as his own would have been in a like case, talk and
                        nothing more. The fort could not hold out an hour, he well knew. Then what?
                        Ah, he but too well realized the result.</p>
                    <p>Resistance would inflame the English soldiers and madden the Indians. There
                        would be a massacre, and the belts of savages would sag with bloody scalps.
                        He shrugged his shoulders and felt a chill creep up his back.</p>
                    <p>The first thing M. Roussillon did was to see Father Beret and take counsel of
                        him; then he hurried home to dig a great pit under his kitchen floor in
                        which he buried many bales of fur and all his most valuable things. He
                        worked like a giant beaver all night long. Meantime Father Beret went about
                        over the town quietly notifying the inhabitants to remain in their houses
                        until after the fort should surrender, which he was sure would happen the
                        next day.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will be perfectly safe, my children,&quot; he said to them.
                        &quot;No harm can come to you if you follow my directions.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Relying implicitly upon him, they scrupulously obeyed in every particular.</p>
                    <p>He did not think it necessary to call at Roussillon place, having already
                        given M. Roussillon the best advice he could command.</p>
                    <p>Just at the earliest break of day, while yet the gloom of night scarcely felt
                        the sun&apos;s approach, a huge figure <pb id="VAA2387-156" n="145"/>
                        made haste along the narrow streets in the northern part of the town. If any
                        person had been looking out through the little holes, called windows, in
                        those silent and rayless huts, it would have been easy to recognize M.
                        Roussillon by his stature and his gait, dimly outlined as he was. A thought,
                        which seemed to him an inspiration of genius, had taken possession of him
                        and was leading him, as if by the nose, straight away to Hamilton&apos;s
                        lines. He was freighted with eloquence for the ear of that commander, and as
                        he strode along facing the crisp morning air he was rehearsing under his
                        breath, emphasizing his periods in tragic whispers with sweeping gestures
                        and liberal facial contortions. So absorbed was he in his oratorical
                        soliloquy that he forgot due military precaution and ran plump into the face
                        of a savage picket guard who, without respect for the great M.
                        Roussillon&apos;s dignity, sprang up before him, grunted cavernously,
                        flourished a tomahawk and spoke in excellent and exceedingly guttural
                        Indian:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wah, surrender!&quot;</p>
                    <p>It is probable that no man ever complied with a modest request in a more
                        docile spirit than did M. Roussillon upon that occasion. In fact his
                        promptness must have been admirable, for the savage grunted approval and
                        straightway conducted him to Hamilton&apos;s headquarters on a batteau
                        in the river.</p>
                    <p>The British commander, a hale man of sandy complexion and probably under
                        middle age, was in no very pleasant humor. Some of his orders had been
                        misunderstood by the chief of his Indian allies, so that <pb
                            id="VAA2387-157" n="146"/> a premature exposure of his approach had been
                        made to the enemy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, sir, who are you?&quot; he gruffly demanded, when M.
                        Roussillon loomed before him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am Gaspard Roussillon, the Mayor of Vincennes,&quot; was the
                        lofty reply. &quot;I have come to announce to you officially that my
                        people greet you loyally and that my town is freely at your
                        command.&quot; He felt as important as if his statements had been true.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Humph, that&apos;s it, is it? Well, Mr. Mayor, you have my
                        congratulations, but I should prefer seeing the military commander and
                        accepting his surrender. What account can you give me of the American
                        forces, their numbers and condition?&quot;</p>
                    <p>M. Roussillon winced, inwardly at least, under Hamilton&apos;s very
                        undeferential air and style of address. It piqued him cruelly to be treated
                        as a person without the slightest claim to respect. He somehow forgot the
                        rolling and rhythmical eloquence prepared for the occasion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The American commander naturally would not confide in me, <hi
                            rend="i">Monsieur le Gouverneur</hi>, not at all; we are not very
                        friendly; he ousted me from office, he offended me&quot; he was coughing
                        and stammering.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, the devil! what do I care? Answer my question, sir,&quot;
                        Hamilton gruffly interrupted. &quot;Tell me the number of American
                        troops at the fort, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know exactly. I have not had admittance to the
                        fort. I might be deceived as to numbers; but they&apos;re strong, I
                        believe, <hi rend="i">Monsieur le Gouverneur</hi>, at least they make a
                        great show and much noise.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-158" n="147"/>
                    <p>Hamilton eyed the huge bulk before him for a moment, then turning to a
                        subaltern said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Place this fellow under guard and see that he doesn&apos;t get
                        away. Send word immediately to Captain Farnsworth that I wish to see him at
                        once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The interview thereupon closed abruptly. Hamilton&apos;s emissaries had
                        given him a detailed account of M. Roussillon&apos;s share in submitting
                        Vincennes to rebel dominion, and he was not in the least inclined toward
                        treating him graciously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I would suggest to you, <hi rend="i">Monsieur le Gouverneur</hi>,
                        that my official position demands&quot; M. Roussillon began; but he was
                        fastened upon by two guards, who roughly hustled him aft and bound him so
                        rigidly that he could scarcely move finger or toe.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton smiled coldly and turned to give some orders to a stalwart, ruddy
                        young officer who in a canoe had just rowed alongside the batteau.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Captain Farnsworth,&quot; he said, acknowledging the military
                        salute, &quot;you will take fifty men and make everything ready for a
                        reconnaissance in the direction of the fort. We will move down the river
                        immediately and choose a place to land. Move lively, we have no time to
                        lose.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the meantime Beverley slipped away from the fort and made a hurried call
                        upon Alice at Roussillon place. There was not much they could say to each
                        other during the few moments at command. Alice showed very little
                        excitement; her past experience had fortified her against the alarms of
                        frontier life; <pb id="VAA2387-159" n="148"/> but she understood and
                        perfectly appreciated the situation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; Beverley demanded in sheer
                        despair. He was not able to see any gleam of hope out of the blackness which
                        had fallen around him and into his soul.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What shall you do?&quot; he repeated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take the chances of war,&quot; she said, smiling gravely.
                        &quot;It will all come out well, no doubt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope so, butbut I fear not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His face was gray with trouble. &quot;Helm is determined to fight, and
                        that means&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good!&quot; she interrupted with spirit. &quot;I am so glad
                        of that. I wish I could go to help him! If I were a man I&apos;d love to
                        fight! I think it&apos;s just delightful.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But it is reckless bravado; it is worse than foolishness,&quot;
                        said Beverley, not feeling her mood. &quot;What can two or three men do
                        against an army?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fight and die like men,&quot; she replied, her whole
                        countenance lighting up. &quot;Be heroic!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We will do that, of course; weI do not fear death; but
                        youyou&quot; His voice choked him.</p>
                    <p>A gun shot rang out clear in the distance, and he did not finish speaking.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s probably the beginning,&quot; he added in a
                        moment, extending both hands to her. &quot;Good bye. I must hurry to the
                        fort. Good bye.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She drew a quick breath and turned so white that her look struck him like a
                        sudden and hard blow. He stood for a second, his arms at full reach, then:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-160" n="149"/>
                    <p>&quot;My God, Alice, I cannot, cannot leave you!&quot; he cried, his
                        voice again breaking huskily.</p>
                    <p>She made a little movement, as if to take hold of his hands; but in an
                        instant she stepped back a pace and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t fear about me. I can take care of myself.
                        I&apos;m all right. You&apos;d better return to the fort as quickly
                        as you can. It is your country, your flag, not me, that you must think of
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She folded her arms and stood boldly erect.</p>
                    <p>Never before, in all his life, had he felt such a rebuke. He gave her a
                        straight, strong look in the eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are right, Alice,&quot; he cried, and rushed from the house
                        to the fort.</p>
                    <p>She held her rigid attitude for a little while after she heard him shut the
                        front gate of the yard so forcibly that it broke in pieces, then she flung
                        her arms wide, as if to clasp something, and ran to the door; but Beverley
                        was out of sight. She turned and dropped into a chair. Jean came to her out
                        of the next room. His queer little face was pale and pinched; but his jaw
                        was set with the expression of one who has known danger and can meet it
                        somehow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are they going to scalp us?&quot; he half whispered presently,
                        with a shuddering lift of his distorted shoulders.</p>
                    <p>Her face was buried in her hands and she did not answer. Childlike he turned
                        from one question to another inconsequently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where did Papa Roussillon go to?&quot; he next inquired.
                        &quot;Is he going to fight?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-161" n="150"/>
                    <p>She shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ll tear down the fort, won&apos;t they?&quot;</p>
                    <p>If she heard him she did not make any sign.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ll kill the Captain and Lieutenant and get the fine
                        flag that you set so high on the fort, won&apos;t they, Alice?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She lifted her head and gave the cowering hunchback such a stare that he shut
                        his eyes and put up a hand, as if afraid of her. Then she impulsively took
                        his little misshapen form in her arms and hugged it passionately. Her bright
                        hair fell all over him, almost hiding him. Madame Roussillon was lying on a
                        bed in an adjoining room moaning diligently, at intervals handling her
                        rosary and repeating a prayer. The whole town was silent outside.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you go get the pretty flag down and hide it
                        before they come?&quot; Jean murmured from within the silken meshes of
                        Alice&apos;s hair.</p>
                    <p>In his small mind the gaudy banner was the most beautiful of all things.
                        Every day since it was set up he had gone to gaze at it as it fluttered
                        against the sky. The men had frequently said in his presence that the enemy
                        would take it down if they captured the fort.</p>
                    <p>Alice heard his inquisitive voice; but it seemed to come from far off; his
                        words were a part of the strange, wild swirl in her bosom.
                        Beverley&apos;s look, as he turned and left her, now shook every chord
                        of her being. He had gone to his death at her command. How strong and true
                        and brave he was! In her imagination she saw the flag above him, saw him die
                        like a panther at bay, saw the gay rag snatched down and <pb
                            id="VAA2387-162" n="151"/> torn to shreds by savage hands. It was the
                        tragedy of a single moment, enacted in a flashlight of anticipation.</p>
                    <p>She released Jean so suddenly that he fell to the floor. She remembered what
                        she had said to Beverley on the night of the dance when they were standing
                        under the flag.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You made it and set it up,&quot; he lightly remarked;
                        &quot;you must see that no enemy ever gets possession of it, especially
                        the English.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll take it down and hide it when there&apos;s danger
                        of that,&quot; she said in the same spirit.</p>
                    <p>And now she stood there looking at Jean, without seeing him, and repeated the
                        words under her breath.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll take it down and hide it. They shan&apos;t have
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Madame Roussillon began to call from the other room in a loud, complaining
                        voice; but Alice gave no heed to her querulous demands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stay here, Jean, and take care of Mama Roussillon,&quot; she
                        presently said to the hunchback. &quot;I am going out; I&apos;ll be
                        back soon; don&apos;t you dare leave the house while I&apos;m gone;
                        do you hear?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not wait for his answer; but snatching a hood-like fur cap from a peg
                        on the wall, she put it on and hastily left the house.</p>
                    <p>Down at the fort Helm and Beverley were making ready to resist
                        Hamilton&apos;s attack, which they knew would not be long deferred. The
                        two heavily charged cannon were planted so as to cover the space in front of
                        the gate, and some loaded muskets were ranged near by ready for use.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-163" n="152"/>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll give them one hell of a blast,&quot; growled the
                        Captain, &quot;before they overpower us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley made no response in words; but he was preparing a bit of tinder on
                        the end of a stick with which to fire the cannon. Not far away a little heap
                        of logs was burning in the fort&apos;s area.</p>
                    <p>The British officer, already mentioned as at the head of the line advancing
                        diagonally from the river&apos;s bank, halted his men at a distance of
                        three hundred yards from the fort, and seemed to be taking a deliberately
                        careful survey of what was before him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let &apos;em come a little nearer, Lieutenant,&quot; said
                        Helm, his jaw setting itself like a lion&apos;s. &quot;When we shoot
                        we want to hit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stooped and squinted along his gun.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When they get to that weedy spot out yonder,&quot; he added,
                        &quot;just opposite the little rise in the river bank, we&apos;ll
                        turn loose on &apos;em.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley had arranged his primitive match to suit his fancy, and for probably
                        the twentieth time looked critically to the powder in the beveled touch-hole
                        of his old cannon. He and Helm were facing the enemy, with their backs to
                        the main area of the stockade, when a well known voice attracted their
                        attention to the rear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Any room for a feller o&apos; my size in this here crowded
                        place?&quot; it demanded in a cracked but cheerful tenor.
                        &quot;I&apos;m kind o&apos; outen breath a runnin&apos; to
                        git here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They turned about. It was Oncle Jazon with his long rifle on his shoulder and
                        wearing a very important air. He spoke in English, using the backwoods lingo
                        with the ease of long practice.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-164" n="153"/>
                    <p>&quot;As I&apos;s a comin&apos; in f&apos;om a
                        huntin&apos; I tuck notice &apos;at somepin&apos; was up. I see
                        a lot o&apos; boats on the river an&apos; some fellers wi&apos;
                        guns a scootin&apos; around, so I jes&apos; slipped by &apos;em
                        all an&apos; come in the back way. They&apos;s plenty of
                        &apos;em, I tell you what! I can&apos;t shoot much, but I tuck one
                        chance at a buck Indian out yander and jes&apos; happened to hit
                        &apos;im in the lef&apos; eye. He was one of the gang &apos;at
                        scalped me down yander in Kaintuck.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The greasy old sinner looked as if he had not been washed since he was born.
                        He glanced about with furtive, shifty eyes, grimaced and winked, after the
                        manner of an animal just waking from a lazy nap.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where&apos;s the rest o&apos; the fighters?&quot; he
                        demanded quizzically, lolling out his tongue and peeping past Helm so as to
                        get a glimpse of the English line. &quot;Where&apos;s yer garrison?
                        Have they all gone to breakfas&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The last question set Helm off again cursing and swearing in the most
                        melodramatic rage.</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon turned to Beverley and said in rapid French: &quot;Surely the
                        man&apos;s not going to fight those fellows yonder?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley nodded rather gloomily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; added the old man, fingering his rifle&apos;s
                        stock and taking another glance through the gate, &quot;I can&apos;t
                        shoot wo&apos;th a cent, bein&apos; sort o&apos; nervous like;
                        but I&apos;ll stan&apos; by ye awhile, jes&apos; for luck. I
                        might accidentally hit one of &apos;em.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When a man is truly brave himself there is nothing that touches him like an
                        exhibition of absolutely unselfish <pb id="VAA2387-165" n="154"/> gameness
                        in another. A rush of admiration for Oncle Jazon made Beverley feel like
                        hugging him.</p>
                    <p>Meantime the young British officer showed a flag of truce, and, with a file
                        of men, separated himself from the line, now stationary, and approached the
                        stockade. At a hundred yards he halted the file and came on alone, waving
                        the white clout. He boldly advanced to within easy speaking distance and
                        shouted:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I demand the surrender of this fort.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you&apos;ll not get it, young man,&quot; roared Helm,
                        his profanity well mixed in with the words, &quot;not while
                        there&apos;s a man of us left!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ye&apos;d better use sof&apos; soap on &apos;im,
                        Cap&apos;n,&quot; said Oncle Jazon in English,
                        &quot;cussin&apos; won&apos;t do no good.&quot; While he
                        spoke he rubbed the doughty Captain&apos;s arm and then patted it
                        gently.</p>
                    <p>Helm, who was not half as excited as he pretended to be, knew that Oncle
                        Jazon&apos;s remark was the very essence of wisdom; but he was not yet
                        ready for the diplomatic language which the old trooper called
                        &quot;soft soap.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you the British commander?&quot; he demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said the officer, &quot;but I speak for
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not to me by a damned sight, sir. Tell your commander that I will
                        hear what he has to say from his own mouth. No understrapper will be
                        recognized by me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>That ended the conference. The young officer, evidently indignant, strode
                        back to his line, and an hour later Hamilton himself demanded the
                        unconditional surrender of the fort and garrison.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-166" n="155"/>
                    <p>&quot;Fight for it,&quot; Helm stormed forth. &quot;We are
                        soldiers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton held a confab with his officers, while his forces, under cover of
                        the town&apos;s cabins, were deploying so as to form a half circle about
                        the stockade. Some artillery appeared and was planted directly opposite the
                        gate, not three hundred yards distant. One blast of that battery would, as
                        Helm well knew, level a large part of the stockade.</p>
                    <p>&quot;S&apos;posin&apos; I hev&apos; a cannon, too,
                        seein&apos; it&apos;s the fashion,&quot; said Oncle Jazon.
                        &quot;I can&apos;t shoot much, but I might skeer &apos;em. This
                        little one &apos;ll do me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He set his rifle against the wall and with Beverley&apos;s help rolled
                        one of the swivels alongside the guns already in position.</p>
                    <p>In a few minutes Hamilton returned under the white flag and shouted:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Upon what terms will you surrender?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All the honors of war,&quot; Helm firmly replied.
                        &quot;It&apos;s that or fight, and I don&apos;t care a damn
                        which!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton half turned away, as if done with the parley, then facing the fort
                        again, said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well, sir, haul down your flag.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Helm was dumfounded at this prompt acceptance of his terms. Indeed the
                        incident is unique in history.</p>
                    <p>As Hamilton spoke he very naturally glanced up to where <hi rend="i">la
                            banniere d&apos;Alice Roussillon</hi> waved brilliantly. Someone
                        stood beside it on the dilapidated roof of the old blockhouse, and was
                        already taking it from its place. His aid, Captain Farnsworth, saw this, and
                        the vision made his heart draw in a strong, hot <pb id="VAA2387-167" n="156"
                        /> flood. It was a girl in short skirts and moccasins, with a fur hood on
                        her head, her face, thrillingly beautiful, set around with fluffs of
                        wind-blown brown-gold hair. Farnsworth was too young to be critical and too
                        old to let his eyes deceive him. Every detail of the fine sketch, with its
                        steel-blue background of sky, flashed into his mind, sharp-cut as a cameo.
                        Involuntarily he took off his hat.</p>
                    <p>Alice had come in by way of the postern. She mounted to the roof unobserved,
                        and made her way to the flag, just at the moment when Helm, glad at heart to
                        accept the easiest way out of a tight place, asked Oncle Jazon to lower it.</p>
                    <p>Beverley was thinking of Alice, and when he looked up he could scarcely
                        realize that he saw her; but the whole situation was plain the instant she
                        snatched the staff from its place; for he, too, recollected what she had
                        said at the river house. The memory and the present scene blended perfectly
                        during the fleeting instant that she was visible. He saw that Alice was
                        smiling somewhat as in her most mischievous moods, and when she jerked the
                        staff from its fastening she lifted it high and waved it once, twice, thrice
                        defiantly toward the British lines, then fled down the ragged roof-slope
                        with it and disappeared. The vision remained in Beverley&apos;s eyes
                        forever afterward. The English troops, thinking that the flag was taken down
                        in token of surrender, broke into a wild tumult of shouting.</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon intuitively understood just what Alice <pb id="VAA2387-168"
                            n="157"/> was doing, for he knew her nature and could read her face. His
                        blood effervesced in an instant.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Vive Zhorzh Vasinton! Vive la banniere
                            d&apos;Alice Roussillon!</hi>&quot; he screamed, waving his
                        disreputable cap round his scalpless head. &quot;Hurrah for George
                        Washington! Hurrah for Alice Roussillon&apos;s flag!&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was all over soon. Helm surrendered himself and Beverley with full honors.
                        As for Oncle Jazon, he disappeared at the critical moment. It was not just
                        to his mind to be a prisoner of war, especially under existing conditions;
                        for Hamilton&apos;s Indian allies had some old warpath scores to settle
                        with him dating back to the days when he and Simon Kenton were comrades in
                        Kentucky.</p>
                    <p>When Alice snatched the banner and descended with it to the ground, she ran
                        swiftly out through the postern, as she had once before done, and sped along
                        under cover of the low bluff or swell, which, terrace-like, bounded the flat
                        &quot;bottom&quot; lands southward of the stockade. She kept on
                        until she reached a point opposite Father Beret&apos;s hut, to which she
                        then ran, the flag streaming bravely behind her in the wind, her heart
                        beating time to her steps.</p>
                    <p>It was plainly a great surprise to Father Beret, who looked up from his
                        prayer when she rushed in, making a startling clatter, the loose puncheons
                        shaking together under her reckless feet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Father, here it is! Hide it, hide it, quick!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She thrust the flag toward him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They shall not have it! They shall never have it!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-169" n="158"/>
                    <p>He opened wide his shrewd, kindly eyes; but did not fairly comprehend her
                        meaning.</p>
                    <p>She was panting, half laughing, half crying. Her hair, wildly disheveled,
                        hung in glorious masses over her shoulders. Her face beamed triumphantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They are taking the fort,&quot; she breathlessly added, again
                        urging the flag upon him, &quot;they&apos;re going in, but I got
                        this and ran away with it. Hide it, Father, hide it, quick, quick, before
                        they come!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The daring light in her eyes, the witching play of her dimples, the madcap
                        air intensified by her attitude and the excitement of the violent exercise
                        just endedsomething compounded of all these and moreaffected the good priest
                        strangely. Involuntarily he crossed himself, as if against a dangerous
                        charm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Mon Dieu</hi>, Father Beret,&quot; she exclaimed
                        with impatience, &quot;haven&apos;t you a grain of sense left? Take
                        this flag and hide it, I tell you! Don&apos;t stay there gazing and
                        blinking. Here, quick! They saw me take it, they may be following me. Hurry,
                        hide it somewhere!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He comprehended now, rising from his knees with a queer smile broadening on
                        his face. She put the banner into his hands and gave him a gentle push.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hide it, I tell you, hide it, you dear old goose!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Without speaking he turned the staff over and over in his hand, until the
                        flag was closely wrapped around it, then stooping he lifted a puncheon and
                        with it covered the gay roll from sight.</p>
                    <p>Alice caught him in her arms and kissed him vigorously <pb id="VAA2387-170"
                            n="159"/> on the cheek. Her warm lips made the spot tingle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you dare to let any person have it! It&apos;s
                        the flag of George Washington.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She gave him a strong squeeze.</p>
                    <p>He pushed her from him with both hands and hastily crossed himself; but his
                        eyes were laughing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You ought to have seen me; I waved the flag at themat the
                        Englishand one young officer took off his hat to me! Oh, Father Beret, it
                        was like what is in a novel. They&apos;ll get the fort, but not the
                        banner! Not the banner! I&apos;ve saved it, I&apos;ve saved
                        it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her enthusiasm gave a splendor to her countenance, heightening its riches of
                        color and somehow adding to its natural girlish expression an audacious
                        sweetness. The triumphant success of her undertaking lent the dignity of
                        conscious power to her look, a dignity which always sits well upon a young
                        and somewhat immaturely beautiful face.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret could not resist her fervid eloquence, and he could not run away
                        from her or stop up his ears while she went on. So he had to laugh when she
                        said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, if you had seen it all you would have enjoyed it. There was
                        Oncle Jazon squatting behind the little swivel, and there were Captain Helm
                        and Lieutenant Beverley holding their burning sticks over the big cannon
                        ready to shootall of them so intent that they didn&apos;t see meand
                        yonder came the English officer and his army against the three. When they
                        got close to the gate the officer called out: `Surrender!&apos; and <pb
                            id="VAA2387-171" n="160"/> then Captain Helm yelled back: `Damned if I
                        do! Come another step and I&apos;ll blow you all to hell in a
                        second!&apos; I was mightily in hopes that they&apos;d come on; I
                        wanted to see a cannon ball hit that English commander right in the face; he
                        looked so arrogant.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret shook his head and tried to look disapproving and solemn.</p>
                    <p>Meantime down at the fort Hamilton was demanding the flag. He had seen Alice
                        take it down, and supposed that it was lowered officially and would be
                        turned over to him. Now he wanted to handle it as the best token of his
                        bloodless but important victory.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t order the flag down until after I had accepted
                        your terms,&quot; said Helm, &quot;and when my man started to obey,
                        we saw a young lady snatch it and run away with it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who was the girl?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not inform on women,&quot; said Helm.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton smiled grimly, with a vexed look in his eyes, then turned to Captain
                        Farnsworth and ordered him to bring up M. Roussillon, who, when he appeared,
                        still had his hands tied together.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell me the name of the young woman who carried away the flag from
                        the fort. You saw her, you know every soul in this town. Who was it,
                        sir?&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was a hard question for M. Roussillon to answer. Although his humiliating
                        captivity had somewhat cowed him, still his love for Alice made it
                        impossible for him to give the information demanded by Hamilton. He choked
                        and stammered, but finally managed to say:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-172" n="161"/>
                    <p>&quot;I assure you that I don&apos;t knowI didn&apos;t lookI
                        didn&apos;t seeIt was too far off for me toI was somewhat
                        excitedI&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take him away. Keep him securely bound,&quot; said Hamilton.
                        &quot;Confine him. We&apos;ll see how long it will take to refresh
                        his mind. We&apos;ll puncture the big windbag.&quot;</p>
                    <p>While this curt scene was passing, the flag of Great Britain rose over the
                        fort to the lusty cheering of the victorious soldiers.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton treated Helm and Beverley with extreme courtesy. He was a soldier,
                        gruff, unscrupulous and cruel to a degree; but he could not help admiring
                        the daring behavior of these two officers who had wrung from him the best
                        terms of surrender. He gave them full liberty, on parole of honor not to
                        attempt escape or to aid in any way an enemy against him while they were
                        prisoners.</p>
                    <p>Nor was it long before Helm&apos;s genial and sociable disposition won
                        the Englishman&apos;s respect and confidence to such an extent that the
                        two became almost inseparable companions, playing cards, brewing toddies,
                        telling stories, and even shooting deer in the woods together, as if they
                        had always been the best of friends.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton did not permit his savage allies to enter the town, and he
                        immediately required the French inhabitants to swear allegiance to Great
                        Britain, which they did with apparent heartiness, all save M. Roussillon,
                        who was kept in close confinement and bound like a felon, chafing
                        lugubriously and wearing the air of a <pb id="VAA2387-173" n="162"/> martyr.
                        His prison was a little log pen in one corner of the stockade, much open to
                        the weather, its gaping cracks giving him a dreary view of the frozen
                        landscape through which the Wabash flowed in a broad steel-gray current.
                        Helm, who really liked him, tried in vain to procure his release; but
                        Hamilton was inexorable on account of what he regarded as duplicity in M.
                        Roussillon&apos;s conduct.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I&apos;ll let him reflect,&quot; he said;
                        &quot;there&apos;s nothing like a little tyranny to break up a bad
                        case of self-importance. He&apos;ll soon find out that he has over-rated
                        himself!&quot;</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">M. ROUSSILLON ENTERTAINS COLONEL HAMILTON</head>
                    <p>A day or two after the arrival of Hamilton the absent garrison of buffalo
                        hunters straggled back to Vincennes and were duly sworn to demean themselves
                        as lawful subjects of Great Britain. Ren de Ronville was among the first to
                        take the oath, and it promptly followed that Hamilton ordered him pressed
                        into service as a wood-chopper and log-hauler during the erection of a new
                        blockhouse, large barracks and the making of some extensive repairs of the
                        stockade. Nothing could have been more humiliating to the proud young
                        Frenchman. Every day he had to report bright and early to a burly Irish
                        Corporal and be ordered about, as if he had been a slave, cursed at,
                        threatened and forced to work until his hands were blistered and his muscles
                        sore. The bitterest part of it all was that he had to trudge past both
                        Roussillon place and the Bourcier cabin with the eyes of Alice and Adrienne
                        upon him.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton did not forget M. Roussillon in this connection. The giant orator
                        soon found himself face to face with a greater trial even than
                        Ren&apos;s. He was calmly told by the English commander that he could
                        choose between death and telling who it was that stole the flag.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll have you shot, sir, to-morrow morning if you
                        prevaricate about this thing any longer,&quot; said Hamilton, <pb
                            id="VAA2387-175" n="164"/> with a right deadly strain in his voice.
                        &quot;You told me that you knew every man, woman and child in Vincennes
                        at sight. I know that you saw that girl take the flaglying does not serve
                        your turn. I give you until this evening to tell me who she is; if you fail,
                        you die at sunrise to-morrow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In fact, it may be that Hamilton did not really purpose to carry out this
                        blood-thirsty threat; most probably he relied upon M. Roussillon&apos;s
                        imagination to torture him successfully; but the effect, as time proved,
                        could not be accurately foreseen.</p>
                    <p>Captain Farnsworth had energy enough for a dozen ordinary men. Before he had
                        been in Vincennes twelve hours he had seen every nook and corner of its
                        surface. Nor was his activity due altogether to military ardor, although he
                        never let pass an opportunity to serve the best interests of his commander;
                        all the while his mind was on the strikingly beautiful girl whose saucy
                        countenance had so dazzled him from the roof-top of the fort, what time she
                        wrenched away the rebel flag.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll find her, high or low,&quot; he thought,
                        &quot;for I never could fail to recognize that face. She&apos;s a
                        trump.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was not in Alice&apos;s nature to hide from the English. They had held
                        the town and fort before Helm came, and she had not found them troublesome
                        under Abbott. She did not know that M. Roussillon was a prisoner, the family
                        taking it for granted that he had gone away to avoid the English. Nor was
                        she aware that Hamilton felt so keenly the disappearance of the flag. What
                        she did know, and it gladdened her greatly, was <pb id="VAA2387-176" n="165"
                        /> that Beverley had been well treated by his captor. With this in her heart
                        she went about Roussillon place singing merry snatches of creole songs; and
                        when at the gate, which still hung lop-sided on account of
                        Beverley&apos;s force in shutting it, she came unexpectedly face to face
                        with Captain Farnsworth, there was no great surprise on her part.</p>
                    <p>He lifted his hat and bowed very politely; but a bold smile broke over his
                        somewhat ruddy face. He spoke in French, but in a drawling tone and with a
                        bad accent:</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you do, Mademoiselle; I am right glad to see you
                        again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice drew back a pace or two. She was quick to understand his allusion, and
                        she shrank from him, fearing that he was going to inquire about the flag.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t be afraid,&quot; he laughed. &quot;I am not
                        so dangerous. I never did hurt a girl in all my life. In fact, I am fond of
                        them when they&apos;re nice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not in the least afraid,&quot; she replied, assuming an
                        air of absolute dismissal, &quot;and you don&apos;t look a bit
                        ferocious, Monsieur. You may pass on, if you please.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He flushed and bit his lip, probably to keep back some hasty retort, and
                        thought rapidly for a moment. She looked straight at him with eyes that
                        stirred and dazzled him. He was handsome in a coarse way, like a fine young
                        animal, well groomed, well fed, magnetic, forceful; but his boldness, being
                        of a sort to which she had not been accustomed, disturbed her vaguely and
                        strangely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Suppose that I don&apos;t pass on?&quot; he presently
                        ventured, <pb id="VAA2387-177" n="166"/> with just a suspicion of insolence
                        in his attitude, but laughing until he showed teeth of remarkable beauty and
                        whiteness. &quot;Suppose that I should wish to have a little chat with
                        you, Mademoiselle?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have been told that there are men in the world who think
                        themselves handsome, and clever, and brilliant, when in fact they are but
                        conceited simpletons,&quot; she remarked, rather indifferently, muffling
                        herself in her fur wrap. &quot;You certainly would be a fairly good
                        hitching-post for our horses if you never moved.&quot; Then she laughed
                        out of the depth of her hood, a perfectly merry laugh, but not in the least
                        flattering to Captain Farnsworth&apos;s vanity. He felt the scorn that
                        it conveyed.</p>
                    <p>His face grew redder, while a flash from hers made him wish that he had been
                        more gracious in his deportment. Here, to his surprise, was not a mere
                        creole girl of the wild frontier.</p>
                    <p>Her superiority struck him with the force of a captivating revelation, under
                        the light of which he blinked and winced.</p>
                    <p>She laid a shapely hand on the broken gate and pushed it open.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I beg your pardon, Mademoiselle;&quot; his manner softened as
                        he spoke; &quot;I beg your pardon; but I came to speak to you about the
                        flagthe flag you took away from the fort.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She had been half expecting this; but she was quite unprepared, and in spite
                        of all she could do showed embarrassment.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-178" n="167"/>
                    <p>&quot;I have come to get the flag; if you will kindly bring it to me, or
                        tell me where it is I&quot;</p>
                    <p>She quickly found words to interrupt him with, and at the same time by a
                        great effort pulled herself together.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have come to the wrong place,&quot; she flung in.
                        &quot;I assure you that I haven&apos;t the flag.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You took it down, Mademoiselle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, did I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;With bewitching grace you did, Mademoiselle. I saw and admired.
                        Will you fetch it, please?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed I won&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The finality in her voice belied her face, which beamed without a ray of
                        stubbornness or perversity. He did not know how to interpret her; but he
                        felt that he had begun wrong. He half regretted that he had begun at all.</p>
                    <p>&quot;More depends upon returning that flag than you are probably aware
                        of,&quot; he presently said in a more serious tone. &quot;In fact,
                        the life of one of your townsmen, and a person of some importance here I
                        believe, will surely be saved by it. You&apos;d better consider,
                        Mademoiselle. You wouldn&apos;t like to cause the death of a
                        man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not fairly grasp the purport of his words; yet the change in his
                        manner, and the fact that he turned from French to English in making the
                        statement, aroused a sudden feeling of dread or dark apprehension in her
                        breast. The first distinct thought was of Beverleythat some deadly danger
                        threatened him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-179" n="168"/>
                    <p>&quot;Who is it?&quot; she frankly demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s the Mayor, the big man of your town, Monsieur
                        Roussillon, I think he calls himself. He&apos;s got himself into a tight
                        place. He&apos;ll be shot to-morrow morning if that flag is not
                        produced. Governor Hamilton has so ordered, and what he orders is
                        done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You jest, Monsieur.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I assure you that I speak the plain truth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will probably catch Monsieur Roussillon before you shoot
                        him.&quot; She tossed her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is already a prisoner in the fort.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice turned pale.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Monsieur, is this true?&quot; Her voice had lost its happy
                        tone. &quot;Are you telling me that to&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can verify it, Mademoiselle, by calling upon the commander at
                        the fort. I am sorry that you doubt my veracity. If you will go with me I
                        will show you M. Roussillon a tightly bound prisoner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jean had crept out of the gate and was standing just behind Alice with his
                        feet wide apart, his long chin elevated, his head resting far back between
                        his up-thrust shoulders, his hands in his pockets, his uncanny eyes gazing
                        steadily at Farnsworth. He looked like a deformed frog ready to jump.</p>
                    <p>Alice unmistakably saw truth in the Captain&apos;s countenance and felt
                        it in his voice. The reality came to her with unhindered effect. M.
                        Roussillon&apos;s life depended upon the return of the flag. She put her
                        hands together and for a moment covered her eyes with them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will go now, Mademoiselle,&quot; said Farnsworth; <pb
                            id="VAA2387-180" n="169"/> &quot;but I hope you will be in great
                        haste about returning the flag.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stood looking at her. He was profoundly touched and felt that to say more
                        would be too brutal even for his coarse nature; so he simply lifted his hat
                        and went away.</p>
                    <p>Jean took hold of Alice&apos;s dress as she turned to go back into the
                        house.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is he going to take the flag? Can he find it? What does he want
                        with it? What did you do with the flag, Alice?&quot; he whined, in his
                        peculiar, quavering voice. &quot;Where is it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her skirt dragged him along as she walked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where did you put it, Alice?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father Beret hid it under his floor,&quot; she answered,
                        involuntarily, and almost unconsciously. &quot;I shall have to take it
                        back and give it up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;NonoI wouldn&apos;t,&quot; he quavered, dancing across the
                        veranda as she quickened her pace and fairly spun him along. &quot;I
                        wouldn&apos;t let &apos;em have it at all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice&apos;s mind was working with lightning speed. Her imagination took
                        strong grip on the situation so briefly and effectively sketched by Captain
                        Farnsworth. Her decision formed itself quickly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stay here, Jean. I am going to the fort. Don&apos;t tell Mama
                        Roussillon a thing. Be a good boy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was gone before Jean could say a word. She meant to face Hamilton at once
                        and be sure what danger menaced M. Roussillon. Of course, the flag must be
                        given up if that would save her foster father any <pb id="VAA2387-181"
                            n="170"/> pain; and if his life were in question there could not be too
                        great haste on her part.</p>
                    <p>She ran directly to the stockade gate and breathlessly informed a sentinel
                        that she must see Governor Hamilton, into whose presence she was soon led.
                        Captain Farnsworth had preceded her but a minute or two, and was present
                        when she entered the miserable shed room where the commander was having
                        another talk with M. Roussillon.</p>
                    <p>The meeting was a tableau which would have been comical but for the pressure
                        of its tragic possibilities. Hamilton, stern and sententious, stood frowning
                        upon M. Roussillon, who sat upon the ground, his feet and hands tightly
                        bound, a colossal statue of injured innocence.</p>
                    <p>Alice, as soon as she saw M. Roussillon, uttered a cry of sympathetic
                        endearment and flung herself toward him with open arms. She could not reach
                        around his great shoulders; but she did her best to include the whole bulk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Papa! Papa Roussillon!&quot; she chirruped between the kisses
                        that she showered upon his weather-beaten face.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton and Farnsworth regarded the scene with curious and surprised
                        interest. M. Roussillon began speaking rapidly; but being a Frenchman he
                        could not get on well with his tongue while his hands were tied. He could
                        shrug his shoulders; that helped him some.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am to be shot, <hi rend="i">ma petite</hi>,&quot; he
                        pathetically growled in his deep bass voice; &quot;shot like a dog at
                        sunrise tomorrow.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-182" n="171"/>
                    <p>Alice kissed M. Roussillon&apos;s rough cheek once more and sprang to her
                        feet facing Hamilton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are not such a fiend and brute as to kill Papa
                        Roussillon,&quot; she cried. &quot;Why do you want to injure my
                        poor, good papa?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I believe you are the young lady that stole the flag?&quot;
                        Hamilton remarked, smilingly contemptuously.</p>
                    <p>She looked at him with a swift flash of indignation as he uttered these
                        words.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not a thief. I could not steal what was my own. I helped to
                        make that flag. It was named after me. I took it because it was mine. You
                        understand me, Monsieur.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell where it is and your father&apos;s life will be
                        spared.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She glanced at M. Roussillon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, Alice,&quot; said he, with a pathetically futile effort to
                        make a fine gesture, &quot;don&apos;t do it. I am brave enough to
                        die. You would not have me act the coward.&quot;</p>
                    <p>No onlooker would have even remotely suspected the fact that M. Roussillon
                        had chanced to overhear a conversation between Hamilton and Farnsworth, in
                        which Hamilton stated that he really did not intend to hurt M. Roussillon in
                        any event; he merely purposed to humiliate the &quot;big
                        wind-bag!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, no; let me die bravely for honor&apos;s sakeI fear death
                        far less than dishonor! They can shoot me, my little one, but they cannot
                        break my proud spirit.&quot; He tried to strike his breast over his
                        heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps it would be just as well to let him be <pb id="VAA2387-183"
                            n="172"/> shot,&quot; said Hamilton gruffly, and with dry
                        indifference. &quot;I don&apos;t fancy that he&apos;s of much
                        value to the community at best. He&apos;ll make a good target for a
                        squad, and we need an example.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you mean it?you ugly English brutewould you murder
                        him?&quot; she stamped her foot.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not if I get that flag between now and sundown Otherwise I shall
                        certainly have him shot. It is all in your hands, Mademoiselle. You can tell
                        me where the flag is.&quot; Hamilton smiled again with exquisite
                        cruelty.</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth stood by gazing upon Alice in open admiration. Her presence had
                        power in it, to which he was very susceptible.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You look like a low, dishonorable, soulless tyrant,&quot; she
                        said to Hamilton, &quot;and if you get my flag, how shall I know that
                        you will keep your promise and let Papa Roussillon go free?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am sorry to say that you will have to trust me, unless
                        you&apos;ll take Captain Farnsworth for security. The Captain is a
                        gentleman, I assure you. Will you stand good for my veracity and sincerity,
                        Captain Farnsworth?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The young man smiled and bowed.</p>
                    <p>Alice felt the irony; and her perfectly frank nature preferred to trust
                        rather than distrust the sincerity of others. She looked at Farnsworth, who
                        smiled encouragingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The flag is under Father Beret&apos;s floor,&quot; she
                        said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Under the church floor?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, under the floor of his house.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-184" n="173"/>
                    <p>&quot;Where is his house?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She gave full directions how to reach it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Untie the prisoner,&quot; Hamilton ordered, and it was quickly
                        done. &quot;Monsieur Roussillon, I congratulate you upon your narrow
                        escape. Go to the priest&apos;s house, Monsieur, and bring me that flag.
                        It would be well, I assure you, not to be very long about it. Captain
                        Farnsworth, you will send a guard with Monsieur Roussillon, a guard of
                        honor, fitting his official dignity, a Corporal and two men. The honorable
                        Mayor of this important city should not go alone upon so important an
                        errand. He must have his attendants.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Permit me to go myself and get it,&quot; said Alice.
                        &quot;I can do it quickly. May I, please, Monsieur?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton looked sharply at her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, certainly, Mademoiselle, certainly. Captain Farnsworth, you
                        will escort the young lady.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is not necessary, Monsieur.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes, it is necessary, my dear young lady, very necessary; so
                        let&apos;s not have further words. I&apos;ll try to entertain his
                        honor, the Mayor, while you go and get the flag. I feel sure, Mademoiselle,
                        that you&apos;ll return with it in a few minutes. But you must not go
                        alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice set forth immediately, and Farnsworth, try as hard as he would, could
                        never reach her side, so swift was her gait.</p>
                    <p>When they arrived at Father Beret&apos;s cabin, she turned and said with
                        imperious severity:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you come in; you stay out here; I&apos;ll get it
                        in a minute.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth obeyed her command.</p>

                    <p>The door was wide open, but Father Beret was not inside; he had gone to see a
                        sick child in the outskirts of the village. Alice looked about and
                        hesitated. She knew the very puncheon that covered the flag; but she shrank
                        from lifting it. There seemed nothing else to do, however; so, after some
                        trouble with herself, she knelt upon the floor and turned the heavy slab
                        over with a great thump. The flag did not appear. She peeped under the other
                        puncheons. It was not there. The only thing visible was a little ball of
                        paper fragments not larger than an egg.</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth heard her utter a low cry of surprise or dismay, and was on the
                        point of going in when Father Beret, coming around the corner of the cabin,
                        confronted him. The meeting was so sudden and unexpected that both men
                        recoiled slightly, and then, with a mutual stare, saluted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I came with a young lady to get the flag,&quot; said
                        Farnsworth. &quot;She is inside. I hope there is no serious intrusion.
                        She says the flag is hidden under your floor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret said nothing, but frowning as if much annoyed, stepped through
                        the doorway to Alice&apos;s side, and stooping where she knelt, laid a
                        hand on her shoulder as she glanced up and recognized him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you doing, my child?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Father, where is the flag?&quot; It was all that she could
                        say. &quot;Where is the flag?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, isn&apos;t it there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, you see it isn&apos;t there! Where is it?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-186" n="175"/>
                    <p>The priest stood as if dumfounded, gazing into the vacant space uncovered by
                        the puncheon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it gone? Has some one taken it away?&quot;</p>
                    <p>They turned up all the floor to no avail. <hi rend="i">La bannire
                            d&apos;Alice Roussillon</hi> had disappeared, and Captain Farnsworth
                        went forthwith to report the fact to his commander. When he reached the shed
                        at the angle of the fort he found Governor Hamilton sitting stupid and dazed
                        on the ground. One jaw was inflamed and swollen and an eye was half closed
                        and bloodshot. He turned his head with a painful, irregular motion and his
                        chin sagged.</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth sprang to him and lifted him to his feet; but he could scarcely
                        stand. He licked his lips clumsily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is the matter? What hurt you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Governor rubbed his forehead trying to recollect.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He struck me,&quot; he presently said with difficulty.
                        &quot;He hit me with his fist. Wherewhere is he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&apos;&quot;That big French idiotthat Roussillongo after him, take
                        him, shoot himquick! I have been stunned; I don&apos;t know how long
                        he&apos;s been gone. Give the alarmdo something!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton, as he gathered his wits together, began to foam with rage, and his
                        passion gave his bruised and swollen face a terrible look.</p>
                    <p>The story was short, and may be quickly told. M. Roussillon had taken
                        advantage of the first moment when he and Hamilton were left alone. One
                        herculean buffet, a swinging smash of his enormous fist on the <pb
                            id="VAA2387-187" n="176"/> point of the Governor&apos;s jaw, and
                        then he walked out of the fort unchallenged, doubtless on account of his
                        lordly and masterful air.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ziff!&quot; he exclaimed, shaking himself and lifting his
                        shoulders, when he had passed beyond hearing of the sentinel at the gate,
                        &quot;ziff! I can punch a good stiff stroke yet, <hi rend="i">Monsieur
                            le Gouverneur.</hi> Ah, ziff!&quot; and he blew like a porpoise.</p>
                    <p>Every effort was promptly made to recapture M. Roussillon; but his
                        disappearance was absolute; even the reward offered for his scalp by
                        Hamilton only gave the Indians great troublethey could not find the man.</p>
                    <p>Such a beginning of his administration of affairs at Vincennes did not put
                        Hamilton into a good humor. He was overbearing and irascible at best, and
                        under the irritation of small but exceedingly unpleasant experiences he made
                        life well-nigh unendurable to those upon whom his dislike chanced to fall.
                        Beverley quickly felt that it was going to be very difficult for him and
                        Hamilton to get along agreeably. With Helm it was quite different; smoking,
                        drinking, playing cards, telling good storiesin a word, rude and not
                        unfrequently boisterous conviviality drew him and the commandant together.</p>
                    <p>Under Captain Farnsworth&apos;s immediate supervision the fort was soon
                        in excellent repair and a large blockhouse and comfortable quarters for the
                        men were built. Every day added to the strength of the works and to the
                        importance of the post as a strategic position for the advance guard of the
                        British army.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-188" n="177"/>
                    <p>Hamilton was ambitious to prove himself conspicuously valuable to his
                        country. He was dreaming vast dreams and laying large plans. The Indians
                        were soon anxious to gain his favor; and to bind them securely to him he
                        offered liberal pay in rum and firearms, blankets, trinkets and ammunition
                        for the scalps of rebels. He kept this as secret as possible from his
                        prisoners; but Beverley soon suspected that a &quot;traffic in
                        hair,&quot; as the terrible business had been named, was going on.
                        Savages came in from far away with scalps yet scarcely dry dangling at their
                        belts. It made the young Virginian&apos;s blood chill in his heart, and
                        he regretted that he had given Hamilton his parole of honor not to attempt
                        to escape.</p>
                    <p>Among the Indians occasionally reporting to Hamilton with their ghastly but
                        valuable trophies was Long-Hair, who slipped into the fort and out again
                        rather warily, not having much confidence in those Frenchmen who had once
                        upon a time given him a memorable run for his life.</p>
                    <p>Winter shut down, not cold, but damp, changeable, raw. The work on the fort
                        was nearly completed, and Ren de Ronville would have soon been relieved of
                        his servile and exasperating employment under the Irish Corporal; but just
                        at the point of time when only a few days&apos; work remained for him,
                        he became furious, on account of an insulting remark, and struck the
                        Corporal over the head with a handspike. This happened in a wood some miles
                        from town, where he was loading logs upon a sled. There chanced to be no
                        third person present when the deed was done, and some <pb id="VAA2387-189"
                            n="178"/> hours passed before they found the officer quite cold and
                        stiff beside the sled. His head was crushed to a pulp.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton, now thoroughly exasperated, began to look upon the French
                        inhabitants of Vincennes as all like M. Roussillon and Ren, but waiting for
                        an opportunity to strike him unawares. He increased his military vigilance,
                        ordered the town patrolled day and night, and forbade public gatherings of
                        the citizens, while at the same time he forced them to furnish him a large
                        amount of provisions.</p>
                    <p>When little Adrienne Bourcier heard of Ren&apos;s terrible act, followed
                        by his successful escape to the woods, and of the tempting reward offered by
                        Hamilton for his scalp, she ran to Roussillon place well-nigh crazed with
                        excitement. She had always depended upon Alice for advice, encouragement and
                        comfort in her troubles; but in the present case there was not much that her
                        friend could do to cheer her. With M. Roussillon and Ren both fugitives,
                        tracked by wily savages, a price on their heads, while every day added new
                        dangers to the French inhabitants of Vincennes, no rosy view could possibly
                        be taken of the situation. Alice did her best, however, to strengthen her
                        little friend&apos;s faith in a happy outcome. She quoted what she
                        considered unimpeachable authority to support her optimistic argument.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lieutenant Beverley says that the Americans will be sure to drive
                        Hamilton out of Vincennes, or capture him. Probably they are not so very far
                        away now, and Ren may join them and come back to help <pb id="VAA2387-190"
                            n="179"/> punish these brutal Englishmen. Don&apos;t you wish he
                        would, Adrienne? Wouldn&apos;t it be romantic?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s armed, I know that,&quot; said Adrienne,
                        brightening a little, &quot;and he&apos;s brave, Alice, brave as can
                        be. He came right back into town the other night and got his gun and
                        pistols. He was at our house, too, and, oh!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She burst out crying again. &quot;O Alice! It breaks my heart to think
                        that the Indians will kill him. Do you think they will kill him,
                        Alice?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;ll come nearer killing them,&quot; said Alice
                        confidently, with her strong, warm arms around the tiny lass;
                        &quot;he&apos;s a good woodsman, a fine shothe&apos;s not so
                        easy to kill, my dear. If he and Papa Roussillon should get together by
                        chance they would be a match for all the Indians in the country. Anyway, I
                        feel that it&apos;s much better for them to take their chances in the
                        woods than to be in the hands of Governor Hamilton. If I were a man
                        I&apos;d do just as Papa Roussillon and Ren did; I&apos;d break the
                        bigoted head of every Englishman that mistreated me. I&apos;ll do it,
                        girl as I am, if they annoy me, see if I don&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was thinking of Captain Farnsworth, who had been from the first untiring
                        in his efforts to gain something more than a passing acquaintance. As yet he
                        had not made himself unbearable; but Alice&apos;s fine intuition led her
                        to the conclusion that she must guard against him from the outset.</p>
                    <p>Adrienne&apos;s simple heart could not grasp the romantic criterion with
                        which Alice was wont to measure action. Her mind was single, impulsive,
                        narrow and <pb id="VAA2387-191" n="180"/> direct in all its movements. She
                        loved, hated, desired, caressed, repulsed, not for any assignable reason
                        more solid or more luminous than &quot;because.&quot; She adored Ren
                        and wanted him near her. He was a hero in her imagination, no matter what he
                        did. Little difference was it to her whether he hauled logs for the English
                        or smoked his pipe in idleness by the winter firewhat could it matter which
                        flag he served under, so that he was true to her? Or whom he served if she
                        could always have him coming to see her and calling her his little pet? He
                        might crush an Irish Corporal&apos;s head every day, if he would but
                        stroke her hair and say: &quot;My sweet little one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why couldn&apos;t he be quiet and do as your man, Lieutenant
                        Beverley, did?&quot; she cried in a sudden change of mood, the tears
                        streaming down her cheeks. &quot;Lieutenant Beverley surrendered and
                        took the consequences. He didn&apos;t kill somebody and run off to be
                        hunted like a bear. No wonder you&apos;re happy, Alice; I&apos;d be
                        happy, too, if Ren were here and came to spend half of every day with me.
                        I&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, what a silly girl you are!&quot; Alice exclaimed, her face
                        reddening prettily. &quot;How foolishly you prattle! I&apos;m sure I
                        don&apos;t trouble myself about Lieutenant Beverleywhat put such absurd
                        nonsense into your head, Adrienne?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because, that&apos;s what, and you know it&apos;s so, too.
                        You love him just as much as I love Ren, and that&apos;s just all the
                        love in the world, and you needn&apos;t deny it, Alice
                        Roussillon!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-192" n="181"/>
                    <p>Alice laughed and hugged the wee, brown-faced mite of a girl until she almost
                        smothered her.</p>
                    <p>It was growing dusk when Adrienne left Roussillon place to go home. The wind
                        cut icily across the commons and moaned as it whirled around the cabins and
                        cattle-sheds. She ran briskly, muffled in a wrap, partly through fear and
                        partly to keep warm, and had gone two-thirds of her way when she was brought
                        to an abrupt stop by the arms of a man. She screamed sharply, and Father
                        Beret, who was coming out of a cabin not far away, heard and knew the voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ho-ho, my little lady!&quot; cried Adrienne&apos;s captor
                        in a breezy, jocund tone, &quot;you wouldn&apos;t run over a fellow,
                        would you?&quot; The words were French, but the voice was that of
                        Captain Farnsworth, who laughed while he spoke. &quot;You jump like a
                        rabbit, my darling! Why, what a lively little chick of a girl it
                        is!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Adrienne screamed and struggled recklessly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now don&apos;t rouse up the town,&quot; coaxed the Captain.
                        He was just drunk enough to be quite a fool, yet sufficiently sober to
                        imagine himself the most proper person in the world. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t mean you any harm, Mademoiselle; I&apos;ll just see you
                        safe home, you know; &apos;scort you to your residence; come on,
                        nowthat&apos;s a good girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret hurried to the spot, and when in the deepening gloom he saw
                        Adrienne flinging heself violently this way and that, helplessly trying to
                        escape from the clasp of a man, he did to perfection what a priest is
                        supposed to be the least fitted to do. Indeed, considering his age and
                        leaving his vocation <pb id="VAA2387-193" n="182"/> out of the reckoning,
                        his performance was amazing. It is not certain that the blow dealt upon
                        Governor Hamilton&apos;s jaw by M. Roussillon was a stiffer one than
                        that sent straight from the priest&apos;s shoulder right into the short
                        ribs of Captain Farnsworth, who thereupon released a mighty grunt and
                        doubled himself up.</p>
                    <p>Adrienne recognized her assailant at the first and used his name freely
                        during the struggle. When Father Beret appeared she cried out to him</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, FatherFather Beret! help me! help me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>When Farnsworth recovered from the breath-expelling shock of the jab in his
                        side and got himself once more in a vertical position, both girl and priest
                        were gone. He looked this way and that, rapidly becoming sober, and
                        beginning to wonder how the thing could have happened so easily. His ribs
                        felt as if they had been hit with a heavy hammer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By Jove!&quot; he muttered all to himself, &quot;the old
                        prayer-singing heathen! By Jove!&quot; And with this very brilliant and
                        relevant observation he rubbed his sore side and went his way to the
                    fort.</p>

                    <p>We hear much about the &quot;days that tried men&apos;s
                        souls&quot;; but what about the souls of women in those same days?
                        Sitting in the liberal geniality of the nineteenth century&apos;s sunset
                        glow, we insist upon having our grumble at the times and the manners of our
                        generation; but if we had to exchange places, periods and experiences with
                        the people who lived in America through the last quarter of the eighteenth
                        century, there would be good ground for despairing ululations. And if our
                        men could not bear it, if it would try their souls too poignantly, let us
                        imagine the effect upon our women. No, let us not imagine it; but rather let
                        us give full credit to the heroic souls of the mothers and the maidens who
                        did actually bear up in the center of that terrible struggle and
                        unflinchingly help win for us not only freedom, but the vast empire which at
                        this moment is at once the master of the world and the model toward which
                        all the nations of the earth are slowly but surely tending.</p>
                    <p>If Alice was an extraordinary girl, she was not aware of it; nor had she ever
                        understood that her life was being shaped by extraordinary conditions. Of
                        course it could not but be plain to her that she knew more and felt more
                        than the girls of her narrow acquaintance; that her accomplishments were
                        greater; that she nursed splendid dreams of which they could <pb
                            id="VAA2387-195" n="184"/> have no proper comprehension, but until now
                        she had never even dimly realized that she was probably capable of being
                        something more than a mere creole lass, the foster daughter of Gaspard
                        Roussillon, trader in pelts and furs. Even her most romantic visions had
                        never taken the form of personal desire, or ambition in its most nebulous
                        stage; they had simply pleased her fresh and natural fancy and served to
                        gild the hardness and crudeness of her life,that was all.</p>
                    <p>Her experiences had been almost too terrible for belief, viewed at our
                        distance from them; she had passed through scenes of incredible horror and
                        suffering, but her nature had not been chilled, stunted or hardened. In body
                        and in temper her development had been sound and beautiful. It was even thus
                        that our great-grandmothers triumphed over adversity, hardship,
                        indescribable danger. We cannot say that the strong, lithe, happy-hearted
                        Alice of old Vincennes was the only one of her kind. Few of us who have
                        inherited the faded portraits of our revolutionary forbears can doubt that
                        beauty, wit and great lovableness flourished in the cabins of pioneers all
                        the way from the Edisto to the Licking, from the Connecticut to the Wabash.</p>
                    <p>Beverley&apos;s advent could not fail to mean a great deal in the life of
                        a girl like Alice; a new era, as it were, would naturally begin for her the
                        moment that his personal influence touched her imagination; but it is well
                        not to measure her too strictly by the standard of our present taste and the
                        specialized forms of our social and moral code. She was a true child of the
                            <pb id="VAA2387-196" n="185"/> wilderness, a girl who grew, as the wild
                        prairie rose grew, not on account of innumerable exigencies, accidents and
                        hardships, but in spite of them. She had blushed unseen, and had wasted
                        divine sweets upon a more than desert air. But when Beverley came near her,
                        at first carelessly droning his masculine monotonies, as the wandering bee
                        to the lonely and lovely rose, and presently striking her soul as with the
                        wings of Love, there fell a change into her heart of hearts, and lo! her
                        haunting and elusive dreams began to condense and take on forms that
                        startled her with their wonderful splendor and beauty. These she saw all the
                        time, sleeping or waking; they made bright summer of the frozen stream and
                        snapping gale, the snowdrifts and the sleet. In her brave young heart,
                        swelled the ineffable songthe music never yet caught by syrinx or flute or
                        violin, the words no tongue can speak.</p>
                    <p>Ah, here may be the secret of that vigorous, brave, sweet life of our pioneer
                        maids, wives, and mothers. It was love that gave those tender hearts the
                        iron strength and heroic persistence at which the world must forever wonder.
                        And do we appreciate those women? Let the Old World boast its crowned kings,
                        its mailed knights, its ladies of the court and castle; but we of the New
                        World, we of the powerful West, let us brim our cups with the wine of
                        undying devotion, and drink to the memory of the Women of the Revolution,to
                        the humble but good and marvelously brave and faithful women like those of
                        old Vincennes.</p>
                    <p>But if Alice was being radically influenced by Beverley, <pb id="VAA2387-197"
                            n="186"/> he in turn found a new light suffusing his nature, and he was
                        not unaware that it came out of her eyes, her face, her smiles, her voice,
                        her soul. It was the old, well-known, inexplicable, mutual magnetism, which
                        from the first has been the same on the highest mountain-top and in the
                        lowest valley. The queen and the milkmaid, the king and the hind may come
                        together only to find the king walking off with the lowly beauty and her
                        fragrant pail, while away stalks the lusty rustic, to be lord and master of
                        the queen. Love is love, and it thrives in all climes, under all conditions.</p>
                    <p>There is an inevitable and curious protest that comes up unbidden between
                        lovers; it takes many forms in accordance with particular circumstances. It
                        is the demand for equality and perfection. Love itself is without degreesit
                        is perfectbut when shall it see the perfect object? It does see it, and it
                        does not see it, in every beloved being. Beverley found his mind turning, as
                        on a pivot, round and round upon the thought that Alice might be impossible
                        to him. The mystery of her life seemed to force her below the line of his
                        aristocratic vision, so that he could not fairly consider her, and yet with
                        all his heart he loved her. Alice, on the other hand, had her bookish ideal
                        to reckon with, despite the fact that she daily dashed it contemptuously
                        down. She was different from Adrienne Bourcier, who bewailed the absence of
                        her untamable lover; she wished that Beverley had not, as she somehow viewed
                        it, weakly surrendered to Hamilton. His apparently complacent acceptance of
                        idle <pb id="VAA2387-198" n="187"/> captivity did not comport with her dream
                        of knighthood and heroism. She had been all the time half expecting him to
                        do something that would stamp him a hero.</p>
                    <p>Counter protests of this sort are never sufficiently vigorous to take a fall
                        out of Love; they merely serve to worry his temper by lightly hindering his
                        feet. <unclear>A--</unclear> it is surprising how Love does delight himself
                        <unclear/> being entangled.</p>
                    <p>Both Beverley and Alice day by day felt the cord tightening which drew their
                        hearts togethereach acknowledged it secretly, but strove not to evince it
                        openly. Meantime both were as happy and as restlessly dissatisfied as love
                        and uncertainty could make them.</p>
                    <p>Amid the activities in which Hamilton was engagedhis dealings with the
                        Indians and the work of reconstructing the forthe found time to worry his
                        temper about the purloined flag. Like every other man in the world, he was
                        superstitious, and it had come into his head that to insure himself and his
                        plans against disaster, he must have the banner of his captives as a badge
                        of his victory. It was a small matter; but it magnified itself as he dwelt
                        upon it. He suspected that Alice had deceived him. He sharply questioned
                        Father Beret, only to be half convinced that the good priest told the truth
                        when he said that he knew nothing whatever on the subject beyond the fact
                        that the banner had mysteriously disappeared from under his floor.</p>
                    <p>Captain Farnsworth scarcely sympathized with his <pb id="VAA2387-199" n="188"
                        /> chief about the flag, but he was nothing if not anxious to gain
                        Hamilton&apos;s highest confidence. His military zeal knew no bounds,
                        and he never let pass even the slightest opportunity to show it. Hence his
                        persistent search for a clue to the missing banner. He was no respecter of
                        persons. He frankly suspected both Alice and Father Beret of lying. He would
                        himself have lied under the existing circumstances, and he considered
                        himself as truthful and trustworthy as priest or maiden.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll get that flag for you,&quot; he said to Hamilton,
                        &quot;if I have to put every man, woman and child in this town on the
                        rack. It lies, I think, between Miss Roussillon and the priest, although
                        both insistently deny it. I&apos;ve thought it over in every way, and I
                        can&apos;t see how they can both be ignorant of where it is, or at least
                        who got it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton, since being treated to that wonderful blow on the jaw, was apt to
                        fall into a spasm of anger whenever the name Roussillon was spoken in his
                        hearing. Involuntarily he would put his hand to his cheek, and grimace
                        reminiscently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If it&apos;s that girl, make her tell,&quot; he savagely
                        commanded. &quot;Let&apos;s have no trifling about it. If
                        it&apos;s the priest, then make him tell, or tie him up by the thumbs.
                        Get that flag, or show some good reason for your failure. I&apos;m not
                        going to be baffled.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Captain&apos;s adventure with Father Beret came just in time to make
                        it count against that courageous and bellicose missionary in more ways than
                        one. Farnsworth did not tell Hamilton or any other person about <pb
                            id="VAA2387-200" n="189"/> what the priest had done to him, but nursed
                        his sore ribs and his wrath, waiting patiently for the revenge that he meant
                        soon to take.</p>
                    <p>Alice heard from Adrienne the story of Farnsworth&apos;s conduct and his
                        humiliating discomfiture at the hands of Father Beret. She was both
                        indignant and delighted, sympathizing with Adrienne and glorying in the
                        priest&apos;s vigorous pugilistic achievement.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; she remarked, with one of her infectious trills of
                        laughter, &quot;so far the French have the best of it, anyway! Papa
                        Roussillon knocked the Governor&apos;s cheek nearly off, then Ren
                        cracked the Irish Corporal&apos;s head, and now Father Beret has taught
                        Captain Farns-worth a lesson in fisticuffs that he&apos;ll not soon
                        forget! If the good work can only go on a little longer we shall see every
                        English soldier in Vincennes wearing the mark of a Frenchman&apos;s
                        blow.&quot; Then her mood suddenly changed from smiling lightness to
                        almost fierce gravity, and she added:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Adrienne Bourcier, if Captain Farnsworth ever offers to treat me as
                        he did you, mark my words, I&apos;ll kill himkill him, indeed I will!
                        You ought to see me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But he won&apos;t dare touch you,&quot; said Adrienne,
                        looking at her friend with round, admiring eyes. &quot;He knows very
                        well that you are not little and timid like me. He&apos;d be afraid of
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish he would try it. How I would love to shoot him into pieces,
                        the hateful wretch! I wish he would.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The French inhabitants all, or nearly all, felt as Alice did; but at present
                        they were helpless and dared not <pb id="VAA2387-201" n="190"/> say or do
                        anything against the English. Nor was this feeling confined to the creoles
                        of Vincennes; it had spread to most of the points where trading posts
                        existed. Hamilton found this out too late to mend some of his mistakes; but
                        he set himself on the alert and organized scouting bodies of Indians under
                        white officers to keep him informed as to the American movements in Kentucky
                        and along the Ohio. One of these bands brought in as captive Colonel Francis
                        Vigo, of St. Louis, a Spaniard by birth, an American by adoption, a patriot
                        to the core, who had large influence over both Indians and creoles in the
                        Illinois country.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Vigo was not long held a prisoner. Hamilton dared not exasperate the
                        creoles beyond their endurance, for he knew that the savages would closely
                        sympathize with their friends of long standing, and this might lead to
                        revolt and coalition against him,a very dangerous possibility. Indeed, at
                        least one of the great Indian chieftains had already frankly informed him
                        that he and his tribe were loyal to the Americans. Here was a dilemma
                        requiring consummate diplomacy. Hamilton saw it, but he was not of a
                        diplomatic temper or character. With the Indians he used a demoralizing
                        system of bribery, while toward the whites he was too often gruff,
                        imperious, repellant. Helm understood the whole situation and was quick to
                        take advantage of it. His personal relations with Hamilton were easy and
                        familiar, so that he did not hesitate to give advice upon all occasions.
                        Here his jovial disposition helped him.</p>

                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d better let Vigo return to St. Louis,&quot; he
                        said. They had a bowl of something hot steaming between them. &quot;I
                        know him. He&apos;s harmless if you don&apos;t rub him too hard the
                        wrong way. He&apos;ll go back, if you treat him well, and tell Clark how
                        strong you are here and how foolish it would be to think of attacking you.
                        Clark has but a handful of men, poorly supplied and tired with long, hard
                        marches. If you&apos;ll think a moment you cannot fail to understand
                        that you&apos;d better be friends with this man Vigo. He and Father
                        Gibault and this old priest here, Beret, carry these Frenchmen in their
                        pockets. I&apos;m not on your side, understand, I&apos;m an
                        American, and I&apos;d blow the whole of you to kingdom come in a
                        minute, if I could; but common sense is common sense all the same.
                        There&apos;s no good to you and no harm to Clark in mistreating, or even
                        holding this prisoner. What harm can he do you by going back to Clark and
                        telling him the whole truth? Clark knew everything long before Vigo reached
                        here. Old Jazon, my best scout, left here the day you took possession, and
                        you may bet he got to Kaskaskia in short order. He never fails. But
                        he&apos;ll tell Clark to stay where he is, and Vigo can do no
                        more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>What effect Helm&apos;s bold and apparently artless talk had upon
                        Hamilton&apos;s mind is not recorded; but the meager historical facts at
                        command show that Vigo was released and permitted to return under promise
                        that he would give no information to the enemy <hi rend="i">on his way</hi>
                        to Kaskaskia.</p>
                    <p>Doubtless this bit of careless diplomacy on the Governor&apos;s part did
                        have a somewhat soothing effect upon <pb id="VAA2387-203" n="192"/> a large
                        class of Frenchmen at Vincennes; but Farns-worth quickly neutralized it to a
                        serious extent by a foolish act while slightly under the influence of
                        liquor.</p>
                    <p>He met Father Beret near Roussillon place, and feeling his ribs squirm at
                        sight of the priest, he accosted him insolently, demanding information as to
                        the whereabouts of the missing flag.</p>
                    <p>A priest may be good and trueFather Beret certainly wasand yet have the
                        strongest characteristics of a worldly man. This thing of being bullied day
                        after day, as had recently been the rule, generated nothing to aid in
                        removing a refractory desire from the priest&apos;s heartthe worldly
                        desire to repeat with great increment of force the punch against
                        Fransworth&apos;s lower ribs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I order you, sir, to produce that rebel flag,&quot; said
                        Farnsworth. &quot;You will obey forthwith or take the consequences. I am
                        no longer in the humor to be trifled with. Do you understand?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I might be forced to obey you, if I could,&quot; said the
                        priest, drawing his robe about him; &quot;but, as I have often told you,
                        my son, I do not know where the flag is or who took it. I do not even
                        suspect any person of taking it. All that I know about it is the simple fact
                        that it is gone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret&apos;s manner and voice were very mild, but there must have
                        been a hint of sturdy defiance somewhere in them. At all events Farnsworth
                        was exasperated and fell into a white rage. Perhaps it was the liquor he had
                        been drinking that made him suddenly desperate.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-204" n="193"/>
                    <p>&quot;You canting old fool!&quot; he cried, &quot;don&apos;t
                        lie to me any longer; I won&apos;t have it. Don&apos;t stand there
                        grinning at me. Get that flag, or I&apos;ll make you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is impossible, my son, is possible to God alone. <hi rend="i"
                            >Apud homines hoc impossibile est, apud Deum autem omnia possibilia
                            sunt.</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;None of your Jesuit Latin or logic to meI am not here to argue, but
                        to command. Get that flag. Be in a hurry about it, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He whipped out his sword, and in his half drunken eyes there gathered the
                        dull film of murderous passion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Put up your weapon, Captain; you will not attack an unarmed priest.
                        You are a soldier, and will not dare strike an old, defenceless
                        man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I will strike a black-robed and black-hearted French rebel. Get
                        that flag, you grinning fool!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The two men stood facing each other. Father Beret&apos;s eyes did not
                        stir from their direct, fearless gaze. What Farnsworth had called a grin was
                        a peculiar smile, not of merriment, a grayish flicker and a slight backward
                        wrinkling of the cheeks. The old man&apos;s arms were loosely crossed
                        upon his sturdy breast.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Strike if you must,&quot; he said very gently, very firmly.
                        &quot;I never yet have seen the man that could make me afraid.&quot;
                        His speech was slightly sing-song in tone, as it would have been during a
                        prayer or a blessing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Get the flag then!&quot; raged Farnsworth, in whose veins the
                        heat of liquor was aided by an unreasoning choler.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I cannot,&quot; said Father Beret.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then take the consequences!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-205" n="194"/>
                    <p>Farnsworth lifted his sword, not to thrust, but to strike with its flat side,
                        and down it flashed with a noisy whack. Father Beret flung out an arm and
                        deftly turned the blow aside. It was done so easily that Farnsworth sprang
                        back glaring and surprised.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You old fool!&quot; he cried, leveling his weapon for a direct
                        lunge. &quot;You devilish hypocrite!&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was then that Father Beret turned deadly pale and swiftly crossed himself.
                        His face looked as if he saw something startling just beyond his adversary.
                        Possibly this sudden change of expression caused Farnsworth to hesitate for
                        a mere point of time. Then there was the swish of a woman&apos;s skirts;
                        a light step pattered on the frozen ground, and Alice sprang between the
                        men, facing Farnsworth. As she did this something small and yellow,the
                        locket at her throat,fell and rolled under her feet. Nobody saw it.</p>
                    <p>In her hand she held an immense horse pistol, which she leveled in the
                        Captain&apos;s face, its flaring, bugle-shaped muzzle gaping not a yard
                        from his nose. The heavy tube was as steady as if in a vise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Drop that sword!&quot;</p>
                    <p>That was all she said; but her finger was pressing the trigger, and the flint
                        in the backward slanting hammer was ready to click against the steel. The
                        leaden slugs were on the point of leaping forth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Drop that sword!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The repetition seemed to close the opportunity for delay.</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth was on his guard in a twinkling. He set his jaw and uttered an
                        ugly oath; then quick as <pb id="VAA2387-206" n="195"/> lightning he struck
                        sidewise at the pistol with his blade. It was a move which might have taken
                        a less alert person than Alice unawares; but her training in sword-play was
                        ready in her wrist and hand. An involuntary turn, the slightest imaginable,
                        set the heavy barrel of her weapon strongly against the blow, partly
                        stopping it, and then the gaping muzzle spat its load of balls and slugs
                        with a bellow that awoke the drowsy old village.</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth staggered backward, letting fall his sword. There was a rent in
                        the clothing of his left shoulder. He reeled; the blood spun out; but he did
                        not fall, although he grew white.</p>
                    <p>Alice stood gazing at him with a look on her face he would never forget. It
                        was a look that changed by wonderful swift gradations from terrible hate to
                        something like sweet pity. The instant she saw him hurt and bleeding, his
                        countenance relaxing and pale, her heart failed her. She took a step toward
                        him, her hand opened, and with a thud the heavy old pistol fell upon the
                        ground beside her.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret sprang nimbly to sustain Farnsworth, snatching up the pistol as
                        he passed around Alice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are hurt, my son,&quot; he gently said, &quot;let me
                        help you.&quot; He passed his arm firmly under that of Farnsworth,
                        seeing that the Captain was unsteady on his feet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lean upon me. Come with me, Alice, my child, and I will take him
                        into the house.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice picked up the Captain&apos;s sword and led the way.</p>
                    <p>It was all done so quickly that Farnsworth, in his <pb id="VAA2387-207"
                            n="196"/> half dazed condition, scarcely realized what was going on
                        until he found himself on a couch in the Roussillon home, his wound (a
                        jagged furrow plowed out by slugs that the sword&apos;s blade had first
                        intercepted) neatly dressed and bandaged, while Alice and the priest hovered
                        over him busy with their careful ministrations.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton and Helm were, as usual, playing cards at the former&apos;s
                        quarters when a guard announced that Mademoiselle Roussillon wished an
                        audience with the Governor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bring the girl in,&quot; said Hamilton, throwing down his cards
                        and scowling darkly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now you&apos;d better be wise as a serpent and gentle as a
                        dove,&quot; remarked Helm. &quot;There is something up, and that
                        gun-shot we heard awhile ago may have a good deal to do with it. At any
                        rate, you&apos;ll find kindness your best card to play with Alice
                        Roussillon just at the present stage of the game.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Of course they knew nothing of what had happened to Farnsworth; but they had
                        been discussing the strained relations between the garrison and the French
                        inhabitants when the roar of Alice&apos;s big-mouthed pistol startled
                        them. Helm was slyly beating about to try to make Hamilton lose sight of the
                        danger from Clark&apos;s direction. To do this he artfully magnified the
                        insidious work that might be done by the French and their Indian friends
                        should they be driven to desperation by oppressive or exasperating action on
                        the part of the English.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton felt the dangerous uncertainty upon which the situation rested; but,
                        like many another vigorously <pb id="VAA2387-208" n="197"/> self-reliant
                        man, he could not subordinate his passions to the dictates of policy. When
                        Alice was conducted into his presence he instantly swelled with anger. It
                        was her father who had struck him and escaped, it was she who had carried
                        off the rebel flag at the moment of victory.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, Miss, to what do I owe the honor of this visit?&quot; he
                        demanded with a supercilious air, bending a card between his thumb and
                        finger on the rude table.</p>
                    <p>She stood before him tall and straight, well bundled in furs. She was not
                        pale; her blood was too rich and brilliant for that; but despite a
                        half-smile and the inextinguishable dimples, there was a touch of something
                        appealingly pathetic in the lines of her mouth. She did not waver or
                        hesitate, however, but spoke promptly and distinctly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have come, Monsieur, to tell you that I have hurt Captain
                        Farnsworth. He was about to kill Father Beret, and I shot him. He is in our
                        house and well cared for. I don&apos;t think his wound is bad.
                        And&quot;here she hesitated at last and let her gaze fall,&quot;so
                        here I am.&quot; Then she lifted her eyes again and made an inimitable
                        French gesture with her shoulders and arms. &quot;You will do as you
                        please, Monsieur, I am at your mercy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton was astounded. Helm sat staring phlegmatically. Meantime Beverley
                        entered the room and stopped hat in hand behind Alice. He was flushed and
                        evidently excited; in fact, he had heard of the trouble with Farnsworth, and
                        seeing Alice enter the door of Hamilton&apos;s quarters he followed her
                        in, his <pb id="VAA2387-209" n="198"/> heart stirred by no slight emotion.
                        He met the Governor&apos;s glare and parried it with one of equal
                        haughtiness. The veins on his forehead swelled and turned dark. He was in a
                        mood to do whatever desperate act should suggest itself.</p>
                    <p>When Hamilton fairly comprehended the message so graphically presented by
                        Alice, he rose from his seat by the fire.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s this you tell me?&quot; he blurted.
                        &quot;You say you&apos;ve shot Captain Farnsworth?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Oui, Monsieur.</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stared a moment, then his features beamed with hate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I&apos;ll have you shot for it, Miss, as sure as you stand
                        there in your silly impudence ogling me so brazenly!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He leaned toward her as he spoke and sent with the words a shock of coarse,
                        passionate energy from which she recoiled as if expecting a blow to follow
                        it.</p>
                    <p>An irresistible impulse swept Beverley to Alice&apos;s side, and his
                        attitude was that of a protector. Helm sprang up.</p>
                    <p>A Lieutenant came in and respectfully, but with evident over-haste, reported
                        that Captain Farnsworth had been shot and was at Roussillon place in care of
                        the surgeon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take this girl into custody. Confine her and put a strong guard
                        over her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In giving the order Hamilton jerked his thumb contemptuously toward Alice,
                        and at the same time gave Beverley a look of supreme defiance and hatred.
                        When <pb id="VAA2387-210" n="199"/> Helm began to speak he turned fiercely
                        upon him and stopped him with:</p>
                    <p>&quot;None of your advice, sir. I have had all I want of it. Keep your
                        place or I&apos;ll make you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then to Beverley:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Retire, sir. When I wish to see you I&apos;ll send for you. At
                        present you are not needed here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The English Lieutenant saluted his commander, bowed respectfully to Alice and
                        said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come with me, Miss, please.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Helm and Beverley exchanged a look of helpless and enquiring rage. It was as
                        if they had said: &quot;What can we do? Must we bear it?&quot;
                        Certainly they could do nothing. Any interference on their part would be
                        sure to increase Alice&apos;s danger, and at the same time add to the
                        weight of their own humiliation.</p>
                    <p>Alice silently followed the officer out of the room. She did not even glance
                        toward Beverley, who moved as if to interfere and was promptly motioned back
                        by the guard. His better judgement returning held him from a rash and futile
                        act, until Hamilton spoke again, saying loudly as Alice passed through the
                        door:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll see who&apos;s master of this town if I have to
                        shoot every French hoyden in it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Women and children may well fear you, Colonel Hamilton,&quot;
                        said Beverley. &quot;That young lady is your superior.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You say that to me, sir!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is the best I could possibly say of you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will send you along with the wench if you do not <pb
                            id="VAA2387-211" n="200"/> guard your language. A prisoner on parole has
                        no license to be a blackguard.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I return you my parole, sir, I shall no longer regard it as
                        binding,&quot; said Beverley, by a great effort, holding back a blow;
                        &quot;I will not keep faith with a scoundrel who does not know how to be
                        decent in the presence of a young girl. You had better have me arrested and
                        confined. I will escape at the first opportunity and bring a force here to
                        reckon with you for your villainy. And if you dare hurt Alice Roussillon I
                        will have you hanged like a dog!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton looked at him scornfully, smiling as one who feels safe in his
                        authority and means to have his own way with his victim. Naturally he
                        regarded Beverley&apos;s words as the merest vaporings of a helpless and
                        exasperated young man. He saw very clearly that love was having a hand in
                        the affair, and he chuckled inwardly, thinking what a fool Beverley was.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I ordered you to leave this room,&quot; he said with
                        an air and tone of lofty superiority, &quot;and I certainly mean to be
                        obeyed. Go, sir, and if you attempt to escape, or in any way break your
                        parole, I&apos;ll have you shot.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have already broken it. From this moment I shall not regard it.
                        You have heard my statement. I shall not repeat it. Govern yourself
                        accordingly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With these words Beverley turned and strode out of the house, quite beside
                        himself, his whole frame quivering.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton laughed derisively, then looked at Helm and said:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-212" n="201"/>
                    <p>&quot;Helm, I like you; I don&apos;t wish to be unkind to you; but
                        positively you must quit breaking in upon my affairs with your ready-made
                        advice. I&apos;ve given you and Lieutenant Beverley too much latitude,
                        perhaps. If that young fool don&apos;t look sharp he&apos;ll get
                        himself into a beastly lot of trouble. You&apos;d better give him a
                        talk. He&apos;s in a way to need it just now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think so myself,&quot; said Helm, glad to get back upon fair
                        footing with the irascible Governor. &quot;I&apos;ll wait until he
                        cools off somewhat, and then I can manage him. Leave him to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, come walk with me to see what has really happened to
                        Farnsworth. He&apos;s probably not much hurt, and deserves what
                        he&apos;s got. That girl has turned his head. I think I understand the
                        whole affair. A little love, a little wine, some foolishness, and the wench
                        shot him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Helm genially assented; but they were delayed for some time by an officer who
                        came in to consult with Hamilton on some pressing Indian affairs. When they
                        reached Roussillon place they met Beverley coming out; but he did not look
                        at them. He was scarcely aware of them. A little way outside the gate, on
                        going in, he had picked up Alice&apos;s locket and broken chain, which
                        he mechanically put into his pocket. It was all like a dream to him, and yet
                        he had a clear purpose. He was going away from Vincennes, or at least he
                        would try, and woe be to Hamilton on his coming back. It was so easy for an
                        excited young mind to plan great things and to expect success under
                        apparently impossible conditions. Beverley gave Jean <pb id="VAA2387-213"
                            n="202"/> a note for Alice; it was this that took him to Roussillon
                        place; and no sooner fell the night than he shouldered a gun furnished him
                        by Madame Godre, and guided by the woodsman&apos;s fine craft, stole
                        away southward, thinking to swim the icy Wabash some miles below, and then
                        strike across the plains of Illinois to Kaskaskia.</p>
                    <p>It was a desperate undertaking; but in those days desperate undertakings were
                        rather the rule than the exception. Moreover, love was the leader and
                        Beverley the blind follower. Nothing could daunt him or turn him back, until
                        he found an army to lead against Hamilton. It seems but a romantic burst of
                        indignation, as we look back at it, hopelessly foolish, with no possible end
                        but death in the wilderness. Still there was a method in love&apos;s
                        madness, and Beverley, with his superb physique, his knowledge of the
                        wilderness and his indomitable self-reliance, was by no means without his
                        fighting chance for success.</p>

                    <p>Beverley&apos;s absence was not noticed by Hamilton until late on the
                        following day, and even then he scouted Helm&apos;s suggestion that the
                        young man was possibly carrying out his threat to disregard his parole.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He would be quite justified in doing it; you know that very
                        well,&quot; said Helm with a laugh, &quot;and he&apos;s just the
                        man to undertake what is impossible. Of course, however, he&apos;ll get
                        scalped for his trouble, and that will cost you something, I&apos;m
                        happy to say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a matter of small importance,&quot; Hamilton
                        replied; &quot;but I&apos;ll wager you the next toddy that
                        he&apos;s not at the present moment a half-mile from this spot. He may
                        be a fool, I readily grant that he is, but even a fool is not going to set
                        out alone in this kind of weather to go to where your rebel friends are
                        probably toasting their shins by a fire of green logs and half starving over
                        yonder on the Mississippi.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Joking aside, you are doubtless right. Beverley is hot-headed, and
                        if he could he&apos;d get even with you devilish quick; but he
                        hasn&apos;t left Vincennes, I think. Miss Roussillon would keep him here
                        if the place were on fire!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton laughed dryly. He had thought just what Helm was saying.
                        Beverley&apos;s attentions to Alice had not escaped his notice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Speaking of that girl,&quot; he remarked after a
                        moment&apos;s <pb id="VAA2387-215" n="204"/> silence, &quot;what am
                        I do to do with her? There&apos;s no place to keep her, and Farnsworth
                        insists that she wasn&apos;t to blame.&quot; He chuckled again and
                        added:</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s true as gospel. He&apos;s in love with her, too.
                        Seems to be glad she shot him. Says he&apos;s ashamed of himself for
                        ever suspecting her of anything but being a genuine angel. Why,
                        he&apos;s got as flabby as a rabbit and mumbles like a fool!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Same as you or I at his age,&quot; said Helm, taking a chew of
                        tobacco. &quot;She <hi rend="i">is</hi> a pretty thing. Beverley
                        don&apos;t know his foot from his shoulder-blade when she&apos;s
                        anywhere near him. Boys are boys. I&apos;m a sort of a boy
                        myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If she&apos;d give up that flag I&apos;d let her
                        go,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;I hate like the devil to confine her;
                        it looks brutal, and makes me feel like a tyrant.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you ever happened to notice the obvious fact, Governor
                        Hamilton, that Alice Roussillon and Father Beret are not all the French in
                        Vincennes?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean that I don&apos;t for a moment believe that either the
                        girl or the priest knows a thing about where that flag is. They are both as
                        truthful and honorable as people ever get to be. I know them. Somebody else
                        got that flag from under the priest&apos;s floor. You may depend upon
                        that. If Miss Roussillon knew where it is she&apos;d say so, and then
                        dare you to make her tell where it&apos;s hidden.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, the whole devilish town is rotten with treason; that&apos;s
                        very clear. There&apos;s not a loyal soul in it outside of my
                        forces.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-216" n="205"/>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you for not including me among the loyalists.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Humph, I spoke of these French people; they pretend to be true; but
                        I believe they are all traitors.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can manage them if you try. A little jolly kindness goes a long
                        way with &apos;em. <hi rend="i">I</hi> had no trouble while <hi rend="i"
                            >I</hi> held the town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton bit his lip and was silent. Helm was exasperatingly good tempered,
                        and his jocularity was irresistible. While he was yet speaking a guard came
                        up followed by Jean, the hunchback, and saluting said to Hamilton:</p>
                    <p>&quot;The lad wants to see the young lady, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton gazed quizzically at Jean, who planted himself in his habitual
                        attitude before him and stared up into his face with the grotesque
                        expression which seems to be characteristic of hunchbacks and unfledged
                        birdsthe look of an embodied and hideous joke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, sir, what will you have?&quot; the Governor demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to see Alice, if you please.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to give her a book to read.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, indeed. Where is it? Let me see it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jean took from the breast of his loose jerkin a small volume, dog-eared and
                        mildewed, and handed it to Hamilton. Meantime he stood first on one foot,
                        then the other, gnawing his thumb-nail and blinking rapidly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, Helm, just look here!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Manon Lescaut.</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-217" n="206"/>
                    <p>&quot;And what&apos;s that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Haven&apos;t you ever read it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Read what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;This novel<hi rend="i">Manon Lescaut.</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never read a novel in my life. Never expect to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton laughed freely at Helm&apos;s expense, then turned to Jean and
                        gave him back the book.</p>
                    <p>It would have been quite military, had he taken the precaution to examine
                        between the pages for something hidden there, but he did not.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go, give it to her,&quot; he said, &quot;and tell her I
                        send my compliments, with great admiration of her taste in
                        literature.&quot; He motioned the soldier to show Jean to Alice.
                        &quot;It&apos;s a beastly French story,&quot; he added,
                        addressing Helm; &quot;immoral enough to make a pirate blush.
                        That&apos;s the sort of girl Mademoiselle Roussillon is!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t care what kind of a book she reads,&quot;
                        blurted Helm, &quot;she&apos;s a fine, pure, good girl. Everybody
                        likes her. She&apos;s the good angel of this miserable frog-hole of a
                        town. You&apos;d like her yourself, if you&apos;d straighten up and
                        quit burning tow in your brain all the time. You&apos;re always so
                        furious about something that you never have a chance to be just to yourself,
                        or pleasant to anybody else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton turned fiercely on Helm, but a glimpse of the Captain&apos;s
                        broad good-humored face heartily smiling, dispelled his anger. There was no
                        ground upon which to maintain a quarrel with a person so persistently genial
                        and so absurdly frank. And in fact Hamilton was not half so bad as his
                        choleric manifestations <pb id="VAA2387-218" n="207"/> seemed to make him
                        out. Besides, Helm knew just how far to go, just when to stop.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I had got furious at you every time there was overwhelming
                        provocation for it,&quot; Hamilton said, &quot;you&apos;d have
                        been long since hanged or shot. I fancy that I have shown angelic
                        forbearance I&apos;ve given you somewhat more than a prisoner&apos;s
                        freedom.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So you have, so you have,&quot; assented Helm.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve often been surprised at your generous partiality in
                        my case. Let&apos;s have some hot water with something else in it, what
                        do you say? I won&apos;t give you any more advice for five minutes by
                        your watch.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I want some advice at once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What about?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Turn her loose. That&apos;s easy and reputable.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll have to, I presume; but she ought to be
                        punished.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you&apos;ll think less about punishment, revenge and getting
                        even with everybody and everything, you&apos;ll soon begin to
                        prosper.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton winced, but smiled as one quite sure of himself.</p>
                    <p>Jean followed the soldier to a rickety log pen on the farther side of the
                        stockade, where he found the prisoner restlessly moving about like a bird in
                        a rustic cage. It had no comforts, that gloomy little room. There was no
                        fireplace, the roof leaked, and the only furniture consisted of a bench to
                        sit on and a pile of skins for bed. Alice looked charmingly forlorn peeping
                        out of the wraps in which she was bundled against <pb id="VAA2387-219"
                            n="208"/> the cold, her hair fluffed and rimpled in shining disorder
                        around her face.</p>
                    <p>The guard let Jean in and closed the door, himself staying outside.</p>
                    <p>Alice was as glad to see the poor lad as if they had been parted for a year.
                        She hugged him and kissed his drawn little face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You dear, good Jean!&quot; she murmured, &quot;you did not
                        forget me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I brought you something,&quot; he whispered, producing the
                        book.</p>
                    <p>Alice snatched it, looked at it, and then at Jean.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, what did you bring this for? you silly Jean! I didn&apos;t
                        want this. I don&apos;t like this book at all. It&apos;s hateful. I
                        despise it. Take it back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s something in it for you, a paper with writing on
                        it; Lieutenant Beverley wrote it on there. It&apos;s shut up between the
                        leaves about the middle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sh-s-sh! not so loud, the guard&apos;ll hear you,&quot;
                        Alice breathlessly whispered, her whole manner changing instantly. She was
                        trembling, and the color had been whisked from her face, as the flame from a
                        candle in a sudden draught.</p>
                    <p>She found the note and read it a dozen times without a pause, her eyes
                        leaping along the lines back and forth with pathetic eagerness and
                        concentration. Presently she sat down on the bench and covered her face with
                        her hands. A tremor first, then a convulsive sobbing, shook her collapsed
                        form. Jean regarded her with a drolly sympathetic grimace, elevating his <pb
                            id="VAA2387-220" n="209"/> long chin and letting his head settle back
                        between his shoulders.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Jean, Jean!&quot; she cried at last, looking up and
                        reaching out her arms; &quot;O Jean, he is gone, gone, gone!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jean stepped closer to her while she sobbed again like a little child.</p>
                    <p>She pulled him to her and held him tightly against her breast while she once
                        more read the note through blinding tears. The words were few, but to her
                        they bore the message of desolation and despair. A great, haunting, hollow
                        voice in her heart repeated them until they echoed from vague distance to
                        distance.</p>
                    <p>It was written with a bit of lead on the half of a mildewed fly-leaf torn
                        from the book: <text>

                                    <opener>&quot;Dear Alice:</opener>
                                    <p>&quot;I am going away. When you read this, think of me as
                                        hurrying through the wilderness to reach our army and bring
                                        it here. Be brave, as you always have been; be good, as you
                                        cannot help being; wait and watch for me; love me, as I love
                                        you. I will come. Do not doubt it, I will come, and I will
                                        crush Hamilton and his command. Courage, Alice dear;
                                        courage, and wait for me.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>She kissed the paper with passionate fervor, pouring her tears upon it in
                        April showers between which the light of her eyes played almost fiercely, so
                        poignant was her sense of a despair which bordered upon desperation. <pb
                            id="VAA2387-221" n="210"/> &quot;Gone, gone!&quot; It was all
                        she could think or say. &quot;Gone, gone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jean took the offending novel back home with him, hidden under his jerkin;
                        but Beverley&apos;s note lay upon Alice&apos;s heart, a sweet
                        comfort and a crushing weight, when an hour later Hamilton sent for her and
                        she was taken before him. Her face was stained with tears and she looked
                        pitifully distressed and disheveled; yet despite all this her beauty
                        asserted itself with subtle force.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton felt ashamed looking at her, but put on sternness and spoke without
                        apparent sympathy:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Roussillon, you came near committing a great crime. As it is,
                        you have done badly enough; but I wish not to be unreasonably severe. I hope
                        you are sorry for your act, and feel like doing better hereafter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was trembling, but her eyes looked steadily straight into his. They were
                        eyes of baby innocence, yet they irradiated a strong womanly spirit just
                        touched with the old perverse, mischievous light which she could neither
                        banish nor control. When she did not make reply, Hamilton continued:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You may go home now, and I shall expect to have no more trouble on
                        your account.&quot; He made a gesture indicative of dismissal; then, as
                        she turned from him, he added, somewhat raising his voice:</p>
                    <p>&quot;And further, Miss Roussillon, that flag you took from here must
                        positively be returned. See that it is done.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-222" n="211"/>
                    <p>She lifted her head high and walked away, not deigning to give him a word.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Humph! what do you think now of your fine young lady?&quot; he
                        demanded, turning to Helm with a sneering curl of his mouth. &quot;She
                        gives thanks copiously for a kindness, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Poor girl, she was scared nearly out of her life,&quot; said
                        Helm. &quot;She got away from you, like a wounded bird from a snare. I
                        never saw a face more pitiful than hers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Much pity she needs, and greatly like a wounded bird she acts, I
                        must say; but good riddance if she&apos;ll keep her place hereafter. I
                        despise myself when I have to be hard with a woman, especially a pretty one.
                        That girl&apos;s a saucy and fascinating minx, and as dangerous as
                        twenty men. I&apos;ll keep a watch on her movements from this on, and if
                        she gets into mischief again I&apos;ll transport her to Detroit, or give
                        her away to the Indians. She must stop her high-handed
                        foolishness.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Helm saw that Hamilton was talking mere wind, <hi rend="i">vox et praeterea
                            nihil</hi>, and he furthermore felt that his babbling signified no harm
                        to Alice; but Hamilton surprised him presently by saying:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have just learned that Lieutenant Beverley is actually gone. Did
                        you know of his departure?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you saying, sir?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Helm jumped to his feet, not angry, but excited.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Keep cool, you need not answer if you prefer silence or evasion.
                        You may want to go yourself soon.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-223" n="212"/>
                    <p>Helm burst out laughing, but quickly growing serious said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Has Beverley been such a driveling fool as that? Are you in
                        earnest?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He killed two of my scouts, wounded another, and crossed the Wabash
                        in their canoe. He is going straight towards Kaskaskia.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The idiot! Hurrah for him! If you catch your hare you may roast
                        him, but catch him first, Governor!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll joke out of the other corner of your mouth, Captain
                        Helm, if I find out that you gave him aid or countenance in breaking his
                        parole.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Aid or countenance! I never saw him after he walked out of this
                        room. You gave him a devil of a sight more aid and countenance than I did.
                        What are you talking about! Broke his parole! He did no such thing. He
                        returned it to you fairly, as you well know. He told you he was
                        going.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;ve sent twenty of my swiftest Indians after him to
                        bring him back. I&apos;ll let you see him shot. That ought to please
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ll never get him, Governor. I&apos;ll bet high on
                        him against your twenty scalp-lifters any day. Fitzhugh Beverley is the best
                        Indian fighter, Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton excepted, in the American
                        colonies.&quot;</p>
                    <p>On her way home Alice met Father Beret, who turned and walked beside her. He
                        was so overjoyed at her release that he could scarcely speak; but held her
                        hand and stroked it gently while she told him her <pb id="VAA2387-224"
                            n="213"/> story. It was beginning to rain, a steady, cold shower, when
                        they reached the house, and for many days and nights thereafter the downfall
                        continued almost incessantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dear child,&quot; said Father Beret, stopping at the gate and
                        looking beseechingly into Alice&apos;s face, &quot;you must stay at
                        home nowstay in the houseit will be horribly dangerous for you to pass about
                        in the village after yourafter what has happened.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do not fear, Father, I will be careful. Aren&apos;t you coming
                        in? I&apos;ll find you a cake and a glass of wine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, child, not now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then good-bye, good-bye,&quot; she said, turning from him to
                        run into the house. &quot;Come soon, I shall be so lonesome.&quot;</p>
                    <p>On the veranda she suddenly stopped, running her fingers about her neck and
                        into her bosom.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Father, Father Beret, I&apos;ve lost my locket!&quot;
                        she cried. &quot;See if I dropped it there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She went back to the gate, searching the ground with her eyes. Of course she
                        did not find the locket. It was miles and miles away close to the heart of
                        her lover. If she could but have known this, it would have comforted her.
                        Beverley had intended to leave it with Jean, but in his haste and excitement
                        he forgot; writing the note distracted his attention; and so he bore
                        Alice&apos;s picture on his breast and in his heart while pursuing his
                        long and perilous journey.</p>
                    <p>Four of Hamilton&apos;s scouts came upon Beverley twenty miles south of
                        Vincennes, but having the advantage of them, he killed two almost
                        immediately, <pb id="VAA2387-225" n="214"/> and after a running fight, the
                        other two attempted escape in a canoe on the Wabash. Here, firing from a
                        bluff, he wounded a third. Both then plunged headforemost into the water,
                        and by keeping below the surface, got away. The adventure gave Beverley new
                        spirit and self-reliance; he felt that he could accomplish anything
                        necessary to his undertaking. In the captured pirogue he crossed the river,
                        and, to make his trail hard to find, sent the little craft adrift down the
                        current.</p>
                    <p>Then alone, in the dead of winter, he took his bearings and struck across the
                        dreary, houseless plain toward St. Louis.</p>
                    <p>As soon as Hamilton&apos;s discomfited scouts reported to him, he sent
                        Long-Hair with twenty picked savages, armed and supplied for continuous and
                        rapid marching, in pursuit of Beverley. There was a large reward for
                        bringing him in alive, a smaller one for his scalp.</p>
                    <p>When Alice heard of all this, her buoyant and happy nature seemed entirely to
                        desert her for a time. She was proud to find out that Beverley had shown
                        himself brave and capable; it touched her love of heroism; but she knew too
                        much about Indian warfare to hope that he could hold his own against
                        Long-Hair, the wiliest and boldest of scalp-hunters, and twenty of the most
                        experienced braves in Hamilton&apos;s forces. He would almost certainly
                        be killed and scalped, or captured and brought back to be shot or hanged in
                        Vincennes. The thought chilled and curdled her blood.</p>
                    <p>Both Helm and Father Beret tried to encourage and <pb id="VAA2387-226"
                            n="215"/> comfort her by representing the probabilities in the fairest
                        light.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s like hunting for a needle in a haystack, going out to
                        find a man in that wilderness,&quot; said Helm with optimistic
                        cheerfulness; &quot;and besides Beverley is no easy dose for twenty red
                        niggers to take. I&apos;ve seen him tried at worse odds than that, and
                        he got out with a whole skin, too. Don&apos;t you fret about him, Miss
                        Roussillon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Little help came to her from attempts of this sort. She might brighten up for
                        a while, but the dark dread, and the terrible gnawing at her heart, the
                        sinking and despairing in her soul, could not be cured.</p>
                    <p>What added immeasurably to her distress was the attention of Farnsworth,
                        whose wound troubled him but a short time. He seemed to have had a
                        revelation and a change of spirit since the unfortunate rencounter and the
                        subsequent nursing at Alice&apos;s hands. He was grave, earnest, kindly,
                        evidently striving to play a gentle and honorable part. She could feel that
                        he carried a load of regret, that he wanted to pay a full price in good for
                        the evil that he had done; his sturdy English heart was righting itself
                        nobly, yet she but half understood him, until his actions and words began to
                        betray his love; and then she hated him unreasonably. Realizing this,
                        Farnsworth bore himself more like a faithful dog than in the manner hitherto
                        habitual to him. He simply shadowed Alice and would not be rebuffed.</p>
                    <p>There can be nothing more painful to a finely sympathetic nature than regret
                        for having done a kindness. <pb id="VAA2387-227" n="216"/> Alice experienced
                        this to the fullest degree. She had nursed Farnsworth but a little while,
                        yet it was a while of sweet influence. Her tender woman nature felt the
                        blessedness of doing good to her enemy lying helpless in her house and hurt
                        by her own hand. But now she hated the man, and with all her soul she was
                        sorry that she had been kind to him; for out of her kindness he had drawn
                        the spell of a love under which he lived a new life, and all for her. Yet
                        deep down in her consciousness the pity and the pathos of the thing hovered
                        gloomily and would not be driven out.</p>
                    <p>The rain in mid-winter gave every prospect a sad, cold, sodden gray
                        appearance. The ground was soaked, little rills ran in the narrow streets,
                        the small streams became great rivers, the Wabash overflowed its banks and
                        made a sea of all the lowlands on either side. It was hard on the poor
                        dwellers in the thatched and mostly floorless cabins, for the grass roofs
                        gradually let the water through and puddles formed on the ground inside.
                        Fuel was distant and had to be hauled in the pouring rain; provisions were
                        scarce and hunting almost impossible. Many people, especially children, were
                        taken ill with colds and fever. Alice found some relief from her trouble in
                        going from cabin to cabin and waiting upon the sufferers; but even here
                        Farnsworth could not be got rid of; he followed her night and day. Never was
                        a good soldier, for he was that from head to foot, more lovelorn and
                        love-docile. The maiden had completely subdued the man.</p>
                    <p>About this time, deep in a rainy and pitch-black <pb id="VAA2387-228" n="217"
                        /> night, Gaspard Roussillon came home. He tapped on the door again and
                        again. Alice heard, but she hesitated to speak or move. Was she growing
                        cowardly? Her heart beat like a drum. There was but one person in all the
                        world that she could think ofit was not M. Roussillon. Ah, no, she had
                        well-nigh forgotten her gigantic foster father.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is I, <hi rend="i">ma cherie</hi>, it is Gaspard, my love, open
                        the door,&quot; came in a booming half-whisper from without.
                        &quot;Alice, Jean, it is your Papa Roussillon, my dears. Let me
                        in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice was at the door in a minute, unbarring it. M. Roussillon entered, armed
                        to the teeth, the water dribbling from his buckskin clothes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pouf!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;my throat is like
                        dust.&quot; His thoughts were diving into the stores under the floor.
                        &quot;I am famished. Dear children, dear little ones! They are glad to
                        see papa! Where is your mama?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He had Alice in his arms and Jean clung to his legs. Madame Roussillon, to be
                        sure of no mistake, lighted a lamp with a brand that smoldered on the hearth
                        and held it up, then, satisfied as to her husband&apos;s identity, set
                        it on a shelf and flung herself into the affectionate group with clumsy
                        abandon, making a great noise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, my dear Gaspard!&quot; she cried as she lunged forward.
                        &quot;Gaspard, Gaspard!&quot; Her voice fairly lifted the roof; her
                        great weight, hurled with such force, overturned everybody, and all of them
                        tumbled in a heap, the rotund and solid dame sitting on top.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ouf! not so impetuous, my dear,&quot; puffed M. Roussillon,
                        freeing himself from her unpleasant pressure <pb id="VAA2387-229" n="218"/>
                        and scrambling to his feet. &quot;Really you must have fared well in my
                        absence, Madame, you are much heavier.&quot; He laughed and lifted her
                        up as if she had been a child, kissing her resonantly.</p>
                    <p>His gun had fallen with a great clatter. He took it from the floor and
                        examined it to see if it had been injured, then set it in a corner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am afraid we have been making too much noise,&quot; said
                        Alice, speaking very low. &quot;There is a patrol guard every night now.
                        If they should hear you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shh!&quot; whispered M. Roussillon, &quot;we will be very
                        still. Alice, is there something to eat and a drop of wine handy? I have
                        come many miles: I am tired, hungry, thirsty,ziff!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice brought some cold roast venison, a loaf, and a bottle of claret. These
                        she set before him on a little table.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, this is comfort,&quot; he said after he had gulped a full
                        cup. &quot;Have you all been well?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then he began to tell where he had been, what he had seen, and the many
                        things he had done. A Frenchman must babble while he eats and drinks. A
                        little wine makes him eloquent. He talks with his hands, shoulders, eyes.
                        Madame Roussillon, Alice and Jean, wrapped in furs, huddled around him to
                        hear. He was very entertaining, and they forgot the patrol until a noise
                        startled them. It was the low of a cow. They laughed and the master of the
                        house softened his voice.</p>
                    <p>M. Roussillon had been the guest of a great Indian chieftain, who was called
                        the &quot;Gate of the Wabash,&quot; <pb id="VAA2387-230" n="219"/>
                        because he controlled the river. The chief was an old acquaintance and
                        treated him well.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I wanted to see you all,&quot; Gaspard said. &quot;I
                        was afraid something might have happened to you. So I came back just to peep
                        in. I can&apos;t stay, of course; Hamilton would kill me as if I were a
                        wolf. I can remain but an hour and then slip out of town again before
                        daylight comes. The rain and darkness are my friends.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He had seen Simon Kenton, who said he had been in the neighborhood of
                        Vincennes acting as a scout and spy for Clark. Presently and quite casually
                        he added:</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I saw Lieutenant Beverley, too. I suppose you know that he has
                        escaped from Hamilton, and&quot; Here a big mouthful of venison
                        interfered.</p>
                    <p>Alice leaned toward him white and breathless, her heart standing still.</p>
                    <p>Then the door, which had been left unbarred, was flung open and, along with a
                        great rush of wind and rain, the patrol guard, five in number, sprang in.</p>
                    <p>M. Roussillon reached his gun with one hand, with the other swung a
                        tremendous blow as he leaped against the intruders. Madame Roussillon blew
                        out the light. No cave in the depth of earth was ever darker than that room.
                        The patrolmen could not see one another or know what to do; but M.
                        Roussillon laid about him with the strength of a giant. His blows sounded as
                        if they smashed bones. Men fell heavily <unclear>t--mping</unclear> on the
                        floor where he rushed along. Some one fired a pistol and by its flash they
                        all saw him; <pb id="VAA2387-231" n="220"/> but instantly the darkness
                        closed again, and before they could get their bearings he was out and gone,
                        his great bulking form making its way easily over familiar ground where his
                        would-be captors could have proceeded but slowly, even with a light to guide
                        them.</p>
                    <p>There was furious cursing among the patrolmen as they tumbled about in the
                        room, the unhurt ones trampling their prostrate companions and striking
                        wildly at each other in their blindness and confusion. At last one of them
                        bethought him to open a dark lantern with which the night guards were
                        furnished. Its flame was fluttering and gave forth a pale red light that
                        danced weirdly on the floors and walls.</p>
                    <p>Alice had snatched down one of her rapiers when the guards first entered.
                        They now saw her facing them with her slender blade leveled, her back to the
                        wall, her eyes shining dangerously. Madame Roussillon had fled into the
                        adjoining room. Jean had also disappeared. The officer, a subaltern, in
                        charge of the guard, seeing Alice, and not quickly able to make out that it
                        was a woman thus defying him, crossed swords with her. There was small space
                        for action; moreover the officer being not in the least a swordsman, played
                        awkwardly, and quick as a flash his point was down. The rapier entered just
                        below his throat with a dull chucking stab. He leaped backward, feeling at
                        the same time a pair of arms clasp his legs. It was Jean, and the
                        Lieutenant, thus unexpectedly tangled, fell to the floor, breaking but not
                        extinguishing the guard&apos;s lantern as he went down. The little
                        remaining oil spread and flamed up brilliantly, as if <pb id="VAA2387-232"
                            n="221"/> eager for conflagration, sputtering along the uneven boards.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kill that devil!&quot; cried the Lieutenant, in a strangling
                        voice, while trying to regain his feet. &quot;Shoot! Bayonet!&quot;</p>
                    <p>In his pain, rage and haste, he inadvertently set his hand in the midst of
                        the blazing oil, which clung to the flesh with a seething grip.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hell!&quot; he screamed, &quot;fire, fire!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Two or three bayonets were leveled upon Alice. Some one kicked Jean clean
                        across the room, and he lay there curled up in his hairy night-wrap looking
                        like an enormous porcupine.</p>
                    <p>At this point a new performer came upon the stage, a dark-robed thing, so
                        active that its outlines changed elusively, giving it no recognizable
                        features. It might have been the devil himself, or some terrible unknown
                        wild animal clad somewhat to resemble a man, so far as the startled guards
                        could make out. It clawed right and left, hurled one of them against the
                        wall, dashed another through the door into Madame Roussillon&apos;s
                        room, where the good woman was wailing at the top of her voice, and felled a
                        third with a stroke like that of a bear&apos;s paw.</p>
                    <p>Consternation was at high tide when Farnsworth, who always slept with an ear
                        open, reached Roussillon place and quickly quieted things. He was troubled
                        beyond expression when he found out the true state of the affair, for there
                        was nothing that he could do but arrest Alice and take her to Hamilton. It
                        made his heart sink. He would have thought little of ordering <pb
                            id="VAA2387-233" n="222"/> a file of soldiers to shoot a man under the
                        same conditions; but to subject her again to the Governor&apos;s stern
                        crueltyhow could he do it? This time there would be no hope for her.</p>
                    <p>Alice stood before him flushed, disheveled, defiant, sword in hand, beautiful
                        and terrible as an angel. The black figure, man or devil, had disappeared as
                        strangely as it had come. The sub-Lieutenant was having his slight wound
                        bandaged. Men were raging and cursing under their breath, rubbing their
                        bruised heads and limbs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;AliceMademoiselle Roussillon, I am so sorry for this,&quot;
                        said Captain Farnsworth. &quot;It is painful, terrible&quot;</p>
                    <p>He could not go on, but stood before her unmanned. In the feeble light his
                        face was wan and his hurt shoulder, still in bandages, drooped perceptibly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I surrender to you,&quot; she presently said in French,
                        extending the hilt of her rapier to him. &quot;I had to defend myself
                        when attacked by your Lieutenant there. If an officer finds it necessary to
                        set upon a girl with his sword, may not the girl guard her life if she
                        can?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was short of breath, so that her voice palpitated with a touching
                        plangency that shook the man&apos;s heart.</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth accepted the sword; he could do nothing less. His duty admitted of
                        no doubtful consideration; yet he hesitated, feeling around in his mind for
                        a phrase with which to evade the inevitable.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It will be safer for you at the fort, Mademoiselle; let me take you
                        there.&quot;</p>

                    <p>Beverley set out on his mid-winter journey to Kaskaskia with a tempest in his
                        heart, and it was, perhaps, the storm&apos;s energy that gave him the
                        courage to face undaunted and undoubting what his experience must have told
                        him lay in his path. He was young and strong; that meant a great deal; he
                        had taken the desperate chances of Indian warfare many times before this,
                        and the danger counted as nothing, save that it offered the possibility of
                        preventing him from doing the one thing in life he now cared to do. What
                        meant suffering to him, if he could but rescue Alice? And what were life
                        should he fail to rescue her? The old, old song hummed in his heart, every
                        phrase of it distinct above the tumult of the storm. Could cold and hunger,
                        swollen streams, ravenous wild beasts and scalp-hunting savages baffle him?
                        No, there is no barrier that can hinder love. He said this over and over to
                        himself after his rencounter with the four Indian scouts on the Wabash. He
                        repeated it with every heart-beat until he fell in with some friendly red
                        men, who took him to their camp, where to his great surprise he met M.
                        Roussillon. It was his song when again he strode off toward the west on his
                        lonely way.</p>
                    <p>We need not follow him step by step; the monotony of the woods and prairies,
                        the cold rains, alternating with northerly winds and blinding snow, the
                        constant <pb id="VAA2387-235" n="224"/> watchfulness necessary to guard
                        against a meeting with hostile savages, the tiresome tramping, wading and
                        swimming, the hunger, the broken and wretched sleep in frozen and scant
                        wraps,why detail it all?</p>
                    <p>There was but one beautiful thing about itthe beauty of Alice as she seemed
                        to walk beside him and hover near him in his dreams. He did not know that
                        Long-Hair and his band were fast on his track; but the knowledge could not
                        have urged him to greater haste. He strained every muscle to its utmost,
                        kept every nerve to the highest tension. Yonder towards the west was help
                        for Alice; that was all he cared for.</p>
                    <p>But if Long-Hair was pursuing him with relentless greed for the reward
                        offered by Hamilton, there were friendly footsteps still nearer behind him;
                        and one day at high noon, while he was bending over a little fire, broiling
                        some liberal cuts of venison, a finger tapped him on the shoulder. He sprang
                        up and grappled Oncle Jazon; at the same time, standing near by, he saw
                        Simon Kenton, his old-time Kentucky friend. The pungled features of one and
                        the fine, rugged face of the other swam as in a mist before
                        Beverley&apos;s eyes. Kenton was laughing quietly, his strong, upright
                        form shaking to the force of his pleasure. He was in the early prime of a
                        vigorous life, not handsome, but strikingly attractive by reason of a
                        certain glow in his face and a kindly flash in his deep-set eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, well, my boy!&quot; he exclaimed, laying his left hand on
                        Beverley&apos;s shoulder, while in the other he held a long, heavy
                        rifle. &quot;I&apos;m glad to see ye, glad to see ye!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-236" n="225"/>
                    <p>&quot;Thought we was Injuns, eh?&quot; said Oncle Jazon.
                        &quot;An&apos; ef we had `a&apos; been we&apos;d
                        `a&apos; been shore o&apos; your scalp!&quot; The wizzened old
                        creole cackled gleefully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And where are ye going&apos;?&quot; demanded Kenton.
                        &quot;Ye&apos;re making what lacks a heap o&apos; bein&apos;
                        a bee-line for some place or other.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley was dazed and vacant-minded; things seemed wavering and dim. He
                        pushed the two men from him and gazed at them without speaking. Their
                        presence and voices did not convince him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yer meat&apos;s a burnin&apos;,&quot; said Oncle Jazon,
                        stooping to turn it on the smouldering coals. &quot;Ye must be hungry.
                        Cookin&apos; enough for a regiment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenton shook Beverley with rough familiarity, as if to rouse his faculties.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter? Fitz, my lad, don&apos;t ye know Si
                        Kenton? It&apos;s not so long since we were like brothers, and now ye
                        don&apos;t speak to me! Ye&apos;ve not forgot me, Fitz!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mebby he don&apos;t like ye as well as ye thought he
                        did,&quot; drawled Oncle Jazon. &quot;I <hi rend="i">hev</hi> known
                        o&apos; fellers a bein&apos; mistaken jes&apos; thet
                        way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley got his wits together as best he could, taking in the situation by
                        such degrees as seemed at the time unduly slow, but which were really mere
                        momentary falterings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Kenton! Jazon!&quot; he presently exclaimed, a cordial
                        gladness blending with his surprise. &quot;How did you get here? Where
                        did you come from?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked from one to the other back and forth with <pb id="VAA2387-237"
                            n="226"/> a wondering smile breaking over his bronzed and determined
                        face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ve been hot on yer trail for thirty hours,&quot;
                        said Kenton. &quot;Roussillon put us on it back yonder. But what are ye
                        up to? Where are ye goin&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going to Clark at Kaskaskia to bring him
                        yonder.&quot; He waved his hand eastward. &quot;I am going to take
                        Vincennes and kill Hamilton.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, ye&apos;re taking a mighty queer course, my boy, if ye
                        ever expect to find Kaskaskia. Ye&apos;re already twenty miles too far
                        south.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Carryin&apos; his gun on the same shoulder all the
                        time,&quot; said Oncle Jazon, &quot;has made `im kind o&apos;
                        swing in a curve like. `Tain&apos;t good luck no how to carry yer gun on
                        yer lef&apos; shoulder. When you do it meks yer take a longer step with
                        yer right foot than ye do with yer lef&apos;, an&apos; ye
                        can&apos;t walk a straight line to save yer liver. <hi rend="i"
                            >Ventrebleu! la venaison brule encore!</hi> Look at that dasted meat
                        burnin&apos; agin!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He jumped back to the fire to turn the scorching cuts.</p>
                    <p>Beverley wrung Kenton&apos;s hand and looked into his eyes, as a man does
                        when an old friend comes suddenly out of the past, so to say, and brings the
                        freshness and comfort of a strong, true soul to brace him in his hour of
                        greatest need.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of all men in the world, Simon Kenton, you were the least expected;
                        but how glad I am! How thankful! Now I know I shall succeed. We are going to
                        capture Vincennes, Kenton, are we not? We shall, <pb id="VAA2387-238"
                            n="227"/> sha&apos;n&apos;t we, Jazon? Nothing, nothing can
                        prevent us, can it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenton heartily returned the pressure of the young man&apos;s hand, while
                        Oncle Jazon looked up quizzically and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;re a tol&apos;ble `spectable lot to prevent; but
                        then we might git pervented. I&apos;ve seed better men an&apos; us
                        purty consid&apos;ble pervented lots o&apos; times in my
                        life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In speaking the colloquial dialect of the American backwoodsmen, Oncle Jazon,
                        despite years of practice among them, gave to it a creole lisp and some
                        turns of pronunciation not to be indicated by any form of spelling. It added
                        to his talk a peculiar soft drollery. When he spoke French it was mostly
                        that of the <hi rend="i">coureurs de bois</hi>, a <hi rend="i">patois</hi>
                        which still lingers in out-of-the-way nooks of Louisiana.</p>
                    <p>&quot;For my part,&quot; said Kenton, &quot;I am with ye, old
                        boy, in anything ye want to do. But now ye&apos;ve got to tell me
                        everything. I see that ye&apos;re keeping something back. What is
                        it?&quot; He glanced sidewise slyly at Oncle Jazon.</p>
                    <p>Beverley was frank to a fault; but somehow his heart tried to keep Alice all
                        to itself. He hesitated; then</p>
                    <p>&quot;I broke my parole with Governor Hamilton,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;He forced me to do it. I feel altogether justified. I told him
                        beforehand that I should certainly leave Vincennes and go get a force to
                        capture and kill him; and I&apos;ll do it, Simon Kenton, I&apos;ll
                        do it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see, I see,&quot; Kenton assented, &quot;but what was the
                        row about? What did he do to excite yeto make <pb id="VAA2387-239" n="228"/>
                        ye feel justified in breakin&apos; over yer parole in that high-handed
                        way? Fitz, I know ye too well to be fooled by yeyou&apos;ve got
                        somethin&apos; in mind that ye don&apos;t want to tell. Well, then
                        don&apos;t tell it. Oncle Jazon and I will go it blind, won&apos;t
                        we, Jazon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Blind as two moles,&quot; said the old man; &quot;but as
                        for thet secret,&quot; he added, winking both eyes at once, &quot;I
                        don&apos;t know as it&apos;s so mighty hard to guess. It&apos;s
                        always safe to `magine a woman in the case. It&apos;s mostly women `at
                        sends men a trottin&apos; off `bout nothin&apos;, sort o&apos;
                        crazy like.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley looked guilty and Oncle Jazon continued:</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;s a poo&apos;ty gal at Vincennes, an&apos; I
                        see the young man a steppin&apos; into her house about fifteen times a
                        day `fore I lef&apos; the place. Mebbe she&apos;s tuck up
                        wi&apos; one o&apos; them English officers. Gals is slippery
                        an&apos; onsartin&apos;.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jazon!&quot; cried Beverley, &quot;stop that instantly, or
                        I&apos;ll wring your old neck.&quot; His anger was real and he meant
                        what he said. He clenched his hands and glowered.</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon, who was still squatting by the little fire, tumbled over
                        backwards, as if Beverley had kicked him; and there he lay on the ground
                        with his slender legs quivering akimbo in the air, while he laughed in a
                        strained treble that sounded like the whining of a screech-owl.</p>
                    <p>The old scamp did not know all the facts in Beverley&apos;s case, nor did
                        he even suspect what had happened; but he was aware of the young
                        man&apos;s tender feeling <pb id="VAA2387-240" n="229"/> for Alice, and
                        he did shrewdly conjecture that she was a factor in the problem.</p>
                    <p>The rude jest at her expense did not seem to his withered and toughened taste
                        in the least out of the way. Indeed it was a delectable bit of humor from
                        Oncle Jazon&apos;s point of view.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t get mad at the old man,&quot; said Kenton,
                        plucking Beverley aside. &quot;He&apos;s yer friend from his heels
                        to his old scalped crown. Let him have his fun.&quot; Then lowering his
                        voice almost to a whisper he continued:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was in Vincennes for two days and nights spyin&apos; around.
                        Madame Godre hid me in her house when there was need of it. I know how it is
                        with ye; I got all the gossip about ye and the young lady, as well as all
                        the information about Hamilton and his forces that Colonel Clark wants.
                        I&apos;m goin&apos; to Kaskaskia; but I think it quite possible that
                        Clark will be on his march to Vincennes before we get there; for Vigo has
                        taken him full particulars as to the fort and its garrison, and I know that
                        he&apos;s determined to capture the whole thing or die
                        tryin&apos;.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley felt his heart swell and his blood leap strong in his veins at these
                        words.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw ye while I was in Vincennes,&quot; Kenton added,
                        &quot;but I never let ye see me. Ye were a prisoner, and I had no
                        business with ye while your parole held. I felt that it was best not to
                        tempt ye to give me aid, or to let ye have knowledge of me while I was a
                        spy. I left two days before ye did, and should have been at Kaskaskia by
                        this time if I hadn&apos;t run <pb id="VAA2387-241" n="230"/> across
                        Jazon, who detained me. He wanted to go with me, and I waited for him to
                        repair the stock of his old gun. He tinkered at it &apos;tween meals and
                        showers for half a week at the Indian village back yonder before he got it
                        just to suit him. But I tell ye he&apos;s wo&apos;th waiting for any
                        length of time, and I was glad to let him have his way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenton, who was still a young man in his early thirties, respected
                        Beverley&apos;s reticence on the subject uppermost in his mind. Madame
                        Godre had told the whole story with flamboyant embellishments; Kenton had
                        seen Alice, and, inspired with the gossip and a surreptitious glimpse of her
                        beauty, he felt perfectly familiar with Beverley&apos;s condition. He
                        was himself a victim of the tender passion to the extent of being an exile
                        from his Virginia home, which he had left on account of dangerously wounding
                        a rival. But he was well touched with the backwoodsman&apos;s taste for
                        joke and banter. He and Oncle Jazon, therefore, knowing the main feature of
                        Beverley&apos;s predicament, enjoyed making the most of their
                        opportunity in their rude but perfectly generous and kindly way.</p>
                    <p>By indirection and impersonal details, as regarded his feelings toward Alice,
                        Beverley in due time made his friends understand that his whole ambition was
                        centered in rescuing her. Nor did the motive fail to enlist their sympathy
                        to the utmost. If all the world loves a lover, all men having the best
                        virile instinct will fight for a lover&apos;s cause. Both Kenton and
                        Oncle Jazon were enthusiastic; they wanted nothing better than an
                        opportunity to aid in rescuing any girl who had <pb id="VAA2387-242" n="231"
                        /> shown so much patriotism and pluck. But Oncle Jazon was fond of Alice,
                        and Beverley&apos;s story affected him peculiarly on her account.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;s one question I&apos;m a goin&apos; to put
                        to ye, young man,&quot; he said, after he had heard everything and they
                        had talked it all over, &quot;an&apos; I want ye to answer it
                        straight as a bullet f&apos;om yer gun.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, Jazon, go ahead,&quot; said Beverley. &quot;I
                        shall be glad to answer.&quot; But his mind was far away with the
                        gold-haired maiden in Hamilton&apos;s prison. He scarcely knew what he
                        was saying.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Air ye expectin&apos; to marry Alice Roussillon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The three men were at the moment eating the well broiled venison. Oncle
                        Jazon&apos;s puckered lips and chin were dripping with the fragrant
                        grease and juice, which also flowed down his sinewy, claw-like fingers.
                        Overhead in the bare tops of the scrub oaks that covered the prairie oasis,
                        the February wind sang a shrill and doleful song.</p>
                    <p>Beverley started as if a blow had been aimed at him. Oncle Jazon&apos;s
                        question, indeed, was a blow as unexpected as it was direct and powerful.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know it&apos;s poo&apos;ty p&apos;inted,&quot;
                        the old man added after a short pause, &quot;an&apos; ye may think
                        `at I ain&apos;t got no business askin&apos; it; but I have. That
                        leetle gal&apos;s a pet o&apos; mine, an&apos; I&apos;m a
                        lookin&apos; after her, an&apos; expectin&apos; to see `at
                        she&apos;s not bothered by nobody who&apos;s not goin&apos; to
                        do right by her. Marryin&apos; is a mighty good thing, but&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do ye know about matrimony, ye old raw-headed
                        bachelor?&quot; demanded Kenton, who felt impelled <pb id="VAA2387-243"
                            n="232"/> to relieve Beverley of the embarrassment of an answer.
                        &quot;Ye wouldn&apos;t know a wife from a sack o&apos;
                        meal!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now don&apos;t git too peart an&apos; fast, Si
                        Kenton,&quot; cried Oncle Jazon, glaring truculently at his friend, but
                        at the same time showing a dry smile that seemed to be hopelessly entangled
                        in criss-cross wrinkles. &quot;Who told ye I was a bach&apos;lor?
                        Not by a big jump. I&apos;ve been married mighty nigh on to twenty times
                        in my day. Mos&apos;ly Injuns, o&apos; course; but a
                        squaw&apos;s a wife w&apos;en ye marries her, an&apos; I know
                        how it hurts a gal to be dis&apos;p&apos;inted in sich a matter.
                        That&apos;s w&apos;y I put the question I did. I&apos;m not
                        goin&apos; to let no man give sorry to that little Roussillon gal;
                        an&apos; so ye&apos;ve got my say. Ye seed her raise thet flag on
                        the fort, Lieutenant Beverley, an&apos; ye seed her take it down
                        an&apos; git away wi&apos; it. You know `at she deserves
                        nothin&apos; but the best; an&apos; by the Holy Virgin,
                        she&apos;s got to have it, or I&apos;m a goin&apos; to know
                        several reasons why. Thet&apos;s what made me put the question straight
                        to ye, young man, an&apos; I expects a straight answer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley&apos;s face paled; but not with anger. He grasped one of Oncle
                        Jazon&apos;s greasy hands and gave it such a squeeze that the old fellow
                        grimaced painfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you, Oncle Jazon, thank you!&quot; he said, with a
                        peculiar husky burr in his voice. &quot;Alice will never suffer if I can
                        help it. Let the subject drop now, my friend, until we have saved her from
                        the hands of Hamilton.&quot; In the power of his emotion he continued
                            <pb id="VAA2387-244" n="233"/> to grip the old man&apos;s hand with
                        increasing severity of pressure.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Ventrebleu!</hi> let go! Needn&apos;t smash a
                        feller&apos;s fingers &apos;bout it!&quot; screeched Oncle
                        Jazon. &quot;I can&apos;t shoot wo&apos;th a cent, nohow,
                        an&apos; ef ye cripple up my trigger-finger&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenton had been peeping under the low-hanging scrub-oak boughs while Oncle
                        Jazon was speaking these last words; and now he suddenly interrupted:</p>
                    <p>&quot;The devil! look yonder!&quot; he growled out in startling tone.
                        &quot;Injuns!&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was a sharp snap of the conversation&apos;s thread, and at the same
                        time our three friends realized that they had been careless in not keeping a
                        better lookout. They let fall the meat they had not yet finished eating and
                        seized their guns.</p>
                    <p>Five or six dark forms were moving toward them across a little point of the
                        prairie that cut into the wood a quarter of a mile distant.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yander&apos;s more of &apos;em,&quot; said Oncle Jazon,
                        as if not in the least concerned, wagging his head in an opposite direction,
                        from which another squad was approaching.</p>
                    <p>That he duly appreciated the situation appeared only in the celerity with
                        which he acted.</p>
                    <p>Kenton at once assumed command, and his companions felt his perfect fitness.
                        There was no doubt from the first as to what the Indians meant; but even if
                        there had been it would have soon vanished; for in less than three minutes
                        twenty-one savages were swiftly and silently forming a circle inclosing the
                        spot where the three white men, who had covered themselves <pb
                            id="VAA2387-245" n="234"/> as best they could with trees, waited in grim
                        steadiness for the worst.</p>
                    <p>Quite beyond gunshot range, but near enough for Oncle Jazon to recognize
                        Long-Hair as their leader, the Indians halted and began making signs to one
                        another all round the line. Evidently they dreaded to test the marksmanship
                        of such riflemen as they knew most border men to be. Indeed, Long-Hair had
                        personal knowledge of what might certainly be expected from both Kenton and
                        Oncle Jazon; they were terrible when out for fight; the red warriors from
                        Georgia to the great lakes had heard of them; their names smacked of
                        tragedy. Nor was Beverley without fame among Long-Hair&apos;s followers,
                        who had listened to the story of his fighting qualities, brought to
                        Vincennes by the two survivors of the scouting party so cleverly defeated by
                        him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The liver-colored cowards,&quot; said Kenton, &quot;are
                        afeared of us in a shootin&apos;-match; they know that a lot of
                        &apos;em would have to die if they should undertake an open fight with
                        us. It&apos;s some sort of a sneakin&apos; game they are
                        studyin&apos; about just now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m a gittin&apos; mos&apos; too ole to shoot
                        wo&apos;th a cent,&quot; said Oncle Jazon, &quot;but
                        I&apos;d give half o&apos; my scalp ef thet Long-Hair would come
                        clost enough fo&apos; me to git a bead onto his lef&apos; eye.
                        It&apos;s tol&apos;ble plain `at we&apos;re gone goslins this
                        time, I&apos;m thinkin&apos;; still it&apos;d be mighty
                        satisfyin&apos; if I could plug out a lef&apos; eye or two
                        &apos;fore I go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley was silent; the words of his companions were heard by him, but not
                        noticed. Nothing interested him save the thought of escaping and making <pb
                            id="VAA2387-246" n="235"/> his way to Clark. To fail meant infinitely
                        more than death, of which he had as small fear as most brave men, and to
                        succeed meant everything that life could offer. So, in the unlimited
                        selfishness of love, he did not take his companions into account.</p>
                    <p>The three stood in a close-set clump of four or five scrub oaks at the
                        highest point of a thinly wooded knoll that sloped down in all directions to
                        the prairie. Their view was wide, but in places obstructed by the trees.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Men,&quot; said Kenton, after a thoughtful and watchful
                        silence, &quot;the thing looks kind o&apos; squally for us. I
                        don&apos;t see much of a chance to get out of this alive; but
                        we&apos;ve got to try.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He showed by the density of his voice and a certain gray film in his face
                        that he felt the awful gravity of the situation; but he was calm and not a
                        muscle quivered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;s jes&apos; two chances for us,&quot; said
                        Oncle Jazon, &quot;an&apos; them&apos;s as slim as a broom
                        straw. We&apos;ve got to stan&apos; here an&apos; fight it out,
                        or wait till night an&apos; sneak through atween `em an&apos; run
                        for it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see any hope o&apos; sneakin&apos; through
                        the line,&quot; observed Kenton. &quot;It&apos;s not
                        goin&apos; to be dark tonight.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wa-a-1,&quot; Oncle Jazon drawled nonchalantly while he took in
                        a quid of tobacco, &quot;I&apos;ve been into tighter squeezes `an
                        this, many a time, an&apos; I got out, too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Likely enough,&quot; said Kenton, still reflecting while his
                        eyes roamed around the circle of savages.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I fit the skunks in Ferginny &apos;fore you&apos;s thought
                        of, <pb id="VAA2387-247" n="236"/> Si Kenton, an&apos; down in
                        Car&apos;lina in them hills. If ye think I&apos;m a goin&apos;
                        to be scalped where they ain&apos;t no scalp, `ithout tryin&apos; a
                        few dodges, yer a dad dasteder fool an&apos; I used to think ye was,
                        an&apos; that&apos;s makin&apos; a big compliment to
                        ye.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we don&apos;t have to argy this question, Oncle Jazon;
                        they&apos;re a gittin&apos; ready to run in upon us, and
                        we&apos;ve got to fight. I say, Beverley, are ye ready for fast
                        shootin&apos;? Have ye got a plenty of bullets?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, Roussillon gave me a hundred. Do you think&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was interrupted by a yell that leaped from savage mouth to mouth all round
                        the circle, and then the charge began.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Steady, now,&quot; growled Kenton, &quot;let&apos;s not
                        be in a hurry. Wait till they come nigh enough to hit &apos;em before we
                        shoot.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The time was short; for the Indians came on at almost race-horse speed.</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon fired first, the long, keen crack of his small-bore rifle
                        splitting the air with a suggestion of vicious energy, and a lithe young
                        warrior, who was outstripping all his fellows, leaped high and fell
                        paralyzed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t shoot wo&apos;th a cent,&quot; muttered the
                        old man, deftly beginning to reload his gun the while; &quot;but I
                        jes&apos; happened to hit that buck. He&apos;ll never git my scalp,
                        thet&apos;s sartin an&apos; sure.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley and Kenton each likewise dropped an Indian; but the shots did not
                        even check the rush. Long-Hair had planned to capture his prey, not kill it.
                        Every <pb id="VAA2387-248" n="[]"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2387-5">
                            <p>&quot;Steady,&quot; growled Kenton, &quot;wait till they
                                come nigh enough&quot; p. 236.</p>
                        </figure>
                        <pb id="VAA2387-249" n="237"/> savage had his orders to take the white men
                        alive; Hamilton&apos;s larger reward depended on this.</p>
                    <p>Right on they came, as fast as their nimble legs could carry them, yelling
                        like demons; and they reached the grove before the three white men could
                        reload their guns. Then every warrior took cover behind a tree and began
                        scrambling forward from bole to bole, thus approaching rapidly without much
                        exposure.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Our &apos;taters is roasted brown,&quot; muttered Oncle
                        Jazon. He crossed himself. Possibly he prayed; but he was priming his old
                        gun the next instant.</p>
                    <p>Kenton fired again, making a hurried and ineffectual attempt to stop the
                        nearest warrior, who saved himself by quickly skipping behind a tree.
                        Beverley&apos;s gun snapped, the flint failing to make fire; but Oncle
                        Jazon bored a little hole through the head of the Indian nearest him; and
                        then the final rush was made from every direction.</p>
                    <p>A struggle ensued, which for desperate energy has probably never been
                        surpassed. Like three lions at bay, the white men met the shock, and
                        lion-like they fought in the midst of seventeen stalwart and determined
                        savages.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t kill them, take them alive; throw them down and hold
                        them!&quot; was Long-Hair&apos;s order loudly shouted in the tongue
                        of his tribe.</p>
                    <p>Both Kenton and Jazon understood every word and knew the significance of such
                        a command from the leader. It naturally came into Kenton&apos;s mind
                        that Hamilton had been informed of his visit to Vincennes and had offered a
                        reward for his capture. This being <pb id="VAA2387-250" n="238"/> true,
                        death as a spy would be the certain result if he were taken back. He might
                        as well die now. As for Beverley, he thought only of Alice, yonder as he had
                        left her, a prisoner in Hamilton&apos;s hands. Oncle Jazon, if he
                        thought at all, probably considered nothing but present escape, though he
                        prayed audibly to the Blessed Virgin, even while he lay helpless upon the
                        ground, pinned down by the weight of an enormous Indian. He could not move
                        any part of himself, save his lips, and these mechanically put forth the
                        wheezing supplication.</p>
                    <p>Beverley and Kenton, being young and powerful, were not so easily mastered.
                        For a while, indeed, they appeared to be more than holding their own. They
                        time and time again scattered the entire crowd by the violence of their
                        muscular efforts; and after it had finally closed in upon them in a solid
                        body they swayed and swung it back and forth and round and round until the
                        writhing, savage mass looked as if caught in the vortex of a whirlwind. But
                        such tremendous exertion could not last long. Eight to one made too great a
                        difference between the contending parties, and the only possible conclusion
                        of the struggle soon came. Seized upon by desperate, clinging, wolf-like
                        assailants, the white men felt their arms, legs and bodies weighted down and
                        their strength fast going.</p>
                    <p>Kenton fell next after Oncle Jazon, and was soon tightly bound with rawhide
                        thongs. He lay on his back panting and utterly exhausted, while Beverley
                        still kept up the unequal fight.</p>
                    <p>Long-Hair sprang in at the last moment to make <pb id="VAA2387-251" n="239"/>
                        doubly certain the securing of his most important captive. He flung his long
                        and powerful arms around Beverley from behind and made a great effort to
                        throw him upon the ground. The young man, feeling this fresh and vigorous
                        clasp, turned himself about to put forth one more mighty spurt of power. He
                        lifted the stalwart Indian bodily and dashed him headlong against the
                        buttressed root of a tree half a rod distant, breaking the smaller bone of
                        his left fore-arm and well-nigh knocking him senseless.</p>
                    <p>It was a fine exhibition of manly strength; but there could be nothing gained
                        by it. A blow on the back of his head the next instant stretched Beverley
                        face downward and unconscious on the ground. The savages turned him over and
                        looked satisfied when they found that he was not dead. They bound him with
                        even greater care than they had shown in securing the others, while
                        Long-Hair stood by stolidly looking on, meantime supporting his broken
                        fore-arm in his hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ugh! dog!&quot; he grunted, and gave Beverley a kick in the
                        side. Then turning a fiendish stare upon Oncle Jazon he proceeded to deliver
                        against his old, dry ribs three or four like contributions with resounding
                        effect. &quot;Polecat! Little old greasy woman!&quot; he snarled,
                        &quot;make good fire for warrior to dance by!&quot; Kenton also
                        received his full share of the kicks and verbal abuse, after which Long-Hair
                        gave orders for fires to be built. Then he looked to his hurt arm and had
                        the bone set and bandaged, never so much as wincing the while.</p>
                    <p>It was soon apparent that the Indians purposed to celebrate their successful
                        enterprise with a feast. They <pb id="VAA2387-252" n="240"/> cooked a large
                        amount of buffalo steak; then, each with his hands full of the savory meat,
                        they began to dance around the fires, droning meantime an atrociously
                        repellant chant.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;re a `spectin&apos; to hev a leetle bit
                        o&apos; fun outen us,&quot; muttered Oncle Jazon to Beverley, who
                        lay near him. &quot;I onderstan&apos; what they&apos;re up to,
                        dad dast &apos;em! More&apos;n forty years ago, in Ca&apos;lina,
                        they put me an&apos; Jim Hipes through the ga&apos;ntlet,
                        an&apos; arter thet, in Kaintuck, me an&apos; Si Kenton tuck the
                        run. Hi, there, Si! where air ye?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shut yer fool mouth,&quot; Kenton growled under his breath.
                        &quot;Ye&apos;ll have that Injun a kickin&apos; our lights out
                        of us again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon winked at the gray sky and puckered his mouth so that it looked
                        like a nutgall on an old, dry leaf.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the diff&apos;ence?&quot; he demanded.
                        &quot;I&apos;d jest as soon be kicked now as arter while;
                        it&apos;s got to come anyhow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kenton made no response. The thongs were torturing his arms and legs.
                        Beverley was silent, but consciousness had returned, and with it a sense of
                        despair. All three of the prisoners lay face upward quite unable to move,
                        knowing full well that a terrible ordeal awaited them. Oncle
                        Jazon&apos;s grim humor could not be quenched, even by the galling agony
                        of the thongs that buried themselves in the flesh, and the anticipation of
                        torture beside which death would seem a luxury.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-253" n="241"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yap! Long-Hair, how&apos;s yer arm?&quot; he called
                        jeeringly. &quot;Feels pooty good, hay?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Long-Hair, who was not joining in the dance and song, turned when he heard
                        these taunting words, and mistaking whence they came, went to
                        Beverley&apos;s side and kicked him again and again.</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon heard the loud blows, and considered the incident a remarkably
                        good joke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He, he, he!&quot; he snickered, as soon as Long-Hair walked
                        away again. &quot;I does the talkin&apos; an&apos; somebody else
                        gits the thumpin&apos;! He, he, he! I always was devilish lucky. Them
                        kicks was good solid jolts, wasn&apos;t they, Lieutenant? Sounded like
                        they was. He, he, he!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley gave no heed to Oncle Jazon&apos;s exasperating pleasantry; but
                        Kenton, sorely chafing under the pressure of his bonds, could not refrain
                        from making retort in kind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d give ye one poundin&apos; that ye&apos;d
                        remember, Emile Jazon, if I could get to ye, ye old twisted-face,
                        peeled-headed, crooked-mouthed, aggravatin&apos; scamp!&quot; he
                        exclaimed, not thinking how high his naturally strong voice was lifted.
                        &quot;I can stand any fool but a damn fool!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Long-Hair heard the concluding epithet and understood its meaning. Moreover,
                        he thought himself the target at which it was so energetically launched.
                        Wherefore he promptly turned back and gave Kenton a kicking that made his
                        body resound not unlike a drum.</p>
                    <p>And here it was that Oncle Jazon overreached himself. <pb id="VAA2387-254"
                            n="242"/> He was so delighted at Kenton&apos;s luck that he broke
                        forth giggling and thereby drew against his own ribs a considerable
                        improvement of Long-Hair&apos;s pedal applications.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Ventrebleu!</hi>&quot; whined the old man, when
                        the Indian had gone away again. &quot;Holy Mary! Jee-ru-sa-lem!
                        They&apos;s nary bone o&apos; me left &apos;at&apos;s not
                        splintered as fine as toothpickers! S&apos;pose yer satisfied now,
                        ain&apos;t ye, Si Kenton? Ef ye ain&apos;t I&apos;m shore to
                        satisfy ye the fust time I git a chance at ye, ye blab-mouthed
                        eejit!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Before this conversation was ended a rain began to fall, and it rapidly
                        thickened from a desultory shower to a roaring downpour that effectually
                        quenched not only the fires around which the savages were dancing, but the
                        enthusiasm of the dancers as well. During the rest of the afternoon and all
                        night long the fall was incessant, accompanied by a cold, panting, wailing
                        southwest wind.</p>
                    <p>Beverley lay on the ground, face upward, the rawhide strings torturing his
                        limbs, the chill of cold water searching his bones. He could see nothing but
                        the dim, strange canopy of flying rain, against which the bare boughs of the
                        scrub oaks were vaguely outlined; he could hear nothing but the cry of the
                        wind and the swash of the water which fell upon him and ran under him,
                        bubbling and gurgling as if fiendishly exultant.</p>
                    <p>The night dragged on through its terrible length, dealing out its
                        indescribable horrors, and at last morning arrived, with a stingy and
                        uncertain gift of light slowly increasing until the dripping trees appeared
                        forlornly <pb id="VAA2387-255" n="243"/> gray and brown against clouds now
                        breaking into masses that gave but little rain.</p>
                    <p>Beverley lived through the awful trial and even had the hardihood to brighten
                        inwardly with the first flash of sunlight that shot through a cloud-crack on
                        the eastern horizon. He thought of Alice, as he had done all night; but now
                        the thought partook somehow of the glow yonder above old Vincennes, although
                        he could only see its reflection.</p>
                    <p>There was great stir among the Indians. Long-Hair stalked about scrutinizing
                        the ground. Beverley saw him come near time and again with a hideous,
                        inquiring scowl on his face. Grunts and laconic exclamations passed from
                        mouth to mouth, and presently the import of it all could not be mistaken.
                        Kenton and Jazon were gonehad escaped during the nightand the rain had
                        completely obliterated their tracks.</p>
                    <p>The Indians were furious. Long-Hair sent out picked parties of his best
                        scouts with orders to scour the country in all directions, keeping with
                        himself a few of the older warriors. Beverley was fed what he would eat of
                        venison, and Long-Hair made him understand that he would have to suffer some
                        terrible punishment on account of the action of his companions.</p>
                    <p>Late in the day the scouts straggled back with the report that no track or
                        sign of the fugitives had been discovered, and immediately a consultation
                        was held. Most of the warriors, including all of the young bucks, demanded a
                        torture entertainment as compensation for their exertions and the unexpected
                        loss of their own prisoners; for it had been agreed that Beverley belonged
                            <pb id="VAA2387-256" n="244"/> exclusively to Long-Hair, who objected to
                        anything which might deprive him of the great reward offered by Hamilton for
                        the prisoner if brought to him alive.</p>
                    <p>In the end it was agreed that Beverley should be made to run the gauntlet,
                        provided that no deadly weapons were used upon him during the ordeal.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">A PRISONER OF LOVE</head>
                    <p>Alice put on her warmest clothes and followed Captain Farnsworth to the fort,
                        realizing that no pleasant experience awaited her. The wind and rain still
                        prevailed when they were ready to set forth, and, although it was not
                        extremely cold, a searching chill went with every throb that marked the
                        storm&apos;s waves. No lights shone in the village houses. Overhead a
                        gray gloom covered stars and sky, making the darkness in the watery streets
                        seem densely black. Farnsworth offered Alice his arm, but she did not accept
                        it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know the way better than you do,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;Come on, and don&apos;t be afraid that I am going to run. I
                        shall not play any trick on you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well, Mademoiselle, as you like. I trust you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He followed her from the house. He was so filled with the bitterness of what
                        he was doing that he carried her sword in his hand all the way to the fort,
                        quite unaware that its point often touched her dress so that she plainly
                        felt it. Indeed, she thought he was using that ruffianly and dangerous means
                        of keeping pace with her. He had sent the patrol on its rounds, taking upon
                        himself the responsibility of delivering her to Hamilton. She almost ran,
                        urged by the strange excitement that burned in her heart, and he followed
                        somewhat awkwardly, stumbling over the unfamiliar way in the rain and
                        darkness.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-258" n="246"/>
                    <p>At every step he was wishing that she would escape from him. Coarse as his
                        nature was and distorted by hardening experiences, it was rooted in good
                        English honesty and imbued with a chivalric spirit. When, as happened too
                        often, he fell under the influence of liquor, the bad in him promptly came
                        uppermost; but at all other times his better traits made him a good fellow
                        to meet, genial, polite, generous, and inclined to recognize the finer
                        sentiments of manliness. To march into his commander&apos;s presence
                        with Alice as his prisoner lacked everything of agreeing with his taste; yet
                        he had not been willing to give her over into the hands of the patrol. If
                        his regard for military obligation had not been exceptionally strong, even
                        for an English soldier, he would have given way to the temptation of taking
                        her to some place of hiding and safety, instead of brutally subjecting her
                        to Hamilton&apos;s harsh judgment. He anticipated a trying experience
                        for her on account of this new transgression.</p>
                    <p>They hastened along until a lantern in the fort shot a hazy gleam upon them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stop a moment, Mademoiselle,&quot; Farnsworth called.
                        &quot;I say, Miss Roussillon, stop a moment, please.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice halted and turned facing him so short and so suddenly that the rapier
                        in his hand pricked through her wraps and slightly scratched her arm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean, sir?&quot; she demanded, thinking that he had
                        thrust purposely. &quot;Do I deserve this brutality?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mistake me, Miss Roussillon. I cannot be <pb id="VAA2387-259"
                            n="247"/> brutal to you now. Do not fear me; I only had a word to
                        say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you deem it very polite and gentle to jab me with your sword,
                        do you? If I had one in my hand you would not dare try such a thing, and you
                        know it very well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was amazed, not knowing that the sword-point had touched her. He could not
                        see her face, but there was a flash in her voice that startled him with its
                        indignant contempt and resentment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you saying, Miss Roussillon? I don&apos;t understand
                        you. When did I everwhen did I jab you with my sword? I never thought of
                        such a thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;This moment, sir, you did, and you know you did. My arm is bleeding
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She spoke rapidly in French; but he caught her meaning, and for the first
                        became aware of the rapier in his hand. Even then its point was toward her
                        and very near her breast. He lowered it instantly while the truth rushed
                        into his mind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Forgive me,&quot; he murmured, his words barely audible in the
                        tumult of wind and rain, but charged with the intensest feeling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Forgive me; I did not knowit was an accidentI could not do such a
                        thing purposely. Believe me, believe me, Miss Roussillon. I did not mean
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She stood facing him, trying to look right into his eyes. A quality in his
                        voice had checked her hot anger. She could only see his dim outlines in the
                        dull gleam from the fort&apos;s lantern. He seemed to be forlornly
                        wretched.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-260" n="248"/>
                    <p>&quot;I should like to believe you,&quot; she presently said,
                        &quot;but I cannot. You English are all, all despicable, mean,
                        vile!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was remembering the young officer who had assaulted her with his sword in
                        the house a while ago. And (what a strange thing the human brain is!) she at
                        the same time comforted herself with the further thought that Beverley would
                        never, never, be guilty of rudeness to a woman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Some time you shall not say that,&quot; Farnsworth responded.
                        &quot;I asked you to stop a moment that I might beg you to believe how
                        wretchedly sorry I am for what I am doing. But you cannot understand me now.
                        Are you really hurt, Miss Roussillon? I assure you that it was purely
                        accidental.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My hurt is nothing,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am very glad.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, shall we go on to the fort?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You may go where you please, Mademoiselle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She turned her back upon him and without an answering word walked straight to
                        the lantern that hung by the gate of the stockade, where a sentinel tramped
                        to and fro. A few moments later Captain Farnsworth presented her to
                        Hamilton, who had been called from his bed when the news of the trouble at
                        Roussillon place reached the fort.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So you&apos;ve been raising hell again, have you,
                        Miss?&quot; he growled, with an ugly frown darkening his face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; said Farnsworth, &quot;Miss
                        Roussillon was not to blame for&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In your eyes she&apos;d not be to blame, sir, if she <pb
                            id="VAA2387-261" n="249"/> burned up the fort and all of us in
                        it,&quot; Hamilton gruffly interrupted. &quot;Miss, what have you
                        been doing? What are you here for? Captain Farnsworth, you will please state
                        the particulars of the trouble that I have just heard about. And I may as
                        well notify you that I wish to hear no special lover&apos;s pleading in
                        this girl&apos;s behalf.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth&apos;s face whitened with anger; he bit his lip and a shiver
                        ran through his frame; but he had to conquer the passion. In a few words,
                        blunt and direct as musket-balls, he told all the circumstances of what had
                        taken place, making no concealments to favor Alice, but boldly blaming the
                        officer of the patrol, Lieutenant Barlow, for losing his head and attacking
                        a young girl in her own home.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will hear from Barlow,&quot; said Hamilton, after listening
                        attentively to the story. &quot;But take this girl and confine her. Show
                        her no favors. I hold you responsible for her until to-morrow morning. You
                        can retire.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was no room for discussion. Farnsworth saluted and turned to Alice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come with me,&quot; he gently said.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton looked after them as they went out of his room, a curious smile
                        playing around his firmly set lips.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s the most beautiful vixen that I ever saw,&quot;
                        he thought. &quot;She doesn&apos;t look to be a French girl,
                        eitherdecidedly English.&quot; He shrugged his shoulders, then laughed
                        dryly. &quot;Farnsworth&apos;s as crazy as can be, the beggar; in
                        love with her so deep that he <pb id="VAA2387-262" n="250"/> can&apos;t
                        see out. By Jove, she <hi rend="i">is</hi> a beauty! Never saw such eyes.
                        And plucky to beat the devil. I&apos;ll bet my head Barlow&apos;ll
                        be daft about her next!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Still, notwithstanding the lightness of his inward comments, Hamilton
                        regarded the incident as rather serious. He knew that the French inhabitants
                        were secretly his bitter enemies, yet probably willing, if he would humor
                        their peculiar social, domestic and commercial prejudices, to refrain from
                        active hostilities, and even to aid him in furnishing his garrison with a
                        large amount of needed supplies. The danger just now was twofold; his Indian
                        allies were deserting him, and a flotilla loaded with provisions and
                        ammunition from Detroit had failed to arrive. He might, if the French rose
                        against him and were joined by the Indians, have great difficulty defending
                        the fort. It was clear that M. Roussillon had more influence with both
                        creoles and savages than any other person save Father Beret. Urgent policy
                        dictated that these two men should somehow be won over. But to do this it
                        would be necessary to treat Alice in such a way that her arrest would aid,
                        instead of operating against the desired result,a thing not easy to manage.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton was not a man of fine scruples, but he may have been, probably was,
                        better than our American historians have made him appear. His besetting
                        weakness, which, as a matter of course, he regarded as the highest flower of
                        efficiency, was an uncontrollable temper, a lack of fine human sympathy and
                        an inability to forgive. In his calmest moments, when prudence appealed to
                        him, he would resolve to <pb id="VAA2387-263" n="251"/> use diplomatic
                        means; but no sooner was his opinion questioned or his purpose opposed than
                        anger and the thirst for revenge overpowered every gentler consideration. He
                        returned to his bed that night fully resolved upon a pleasant and successful
                        interview with Alice next morning.</p>
                    <p>Captain Farnsworth took his fair prisoner straightway from
                        Hamilton&apos;s presence to a small room connected with a considerable
                        structure in a distant angle of the stockade. Neither he nor Alice spoke on
                        the way. With a huge wooden key he unlocked the door and stepped aside for
                        her to enter. A dim lamp was burning within, its yellowish light flickering
                        over the scant furniture, which consisted of a comfortable bed, a table with
                        some books on it, three chairs, a small looking-glass on the wall, a guitar
                        and some articles of men&apos;s clothing hanging here and there. A heap
                        of dull embers smouldered in the fireplace. Alice did not falter at the
                        threshold, but promptly entered her prison.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope you can be comfortable,&quot; said Farnsworth in a low
                        tone. &quot;It&apos;s the best I can give you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; was the answer spoken quite as if he had
                        handed her a glass of water or picked up her handkerchief.</p>
                    <p>He held the door a moment, while she stopped, with her back toward him, in
                        the middle of the room; then she heard him close and lock it. The air was
                        almost too warm after her exposure to the biting wind and cold dashes of
                        rain. She cast off her outer wraps and stood by the fireplace. At a glance
                        she comprehended <pb id="VAA2387-264" n="252"/> that the place was not the
                        one she had formerly occupied as a prisoner, and that it belonged to a man.
                        A long rifle stood in a corner, a bullet-pouch and powder-horn hanging on a
                        projecting hickory ramrod; a heavy fur top-coat lay across one of the
                        chairs.</p>
                    <p>Alice felt her situation bitterly enough; but she was not of the stuff that
                        turns to water at the touch of misfortune. Pioneer women took hardships as a
                        matter of course, and met calamity with admirable fortitude. There was no
                        wringing of hands, no frantic wailing, no hollow, despairing groan. While
                        life lasted hope flourished, even in most tragic surroundings; and not
                        unfrequently succor came, at the last verge of destruction, as the fitting
                        reward of unconquerable courage. A girl like Alice must be accepted in the
                        spirit of her time and surroundings. She was born amid experiences scarcely
                        credible now, and bred in an area and an atmosphere of incomparable dangers.
                        Naturally she accepted conditions of terrible import with a <hi rend="i"
                            >sang froid</hi> scarcely possible to a girl of our day. She did not
                        cry, she did not sink down helpless when she found herself once more
                        imprisoned with some uncertain trial before her; but simply knelt and
                        repeated the Lord&apos;s prayer, then went to bed and slept; even
                        dreamed the dream of a maid&apos;s first love.</p>
                    <p>Meantime Farnsworth, who had given Alice his own apartment, took what rest he
                        could on the cold ground under a leaky shed hard by. His wound, not yet
                        altogether healed, was not benefited by the exposure.</p>
                    <p>In due time next morning Hamilton ordered Alice <pb id="VAA2387-265" n="253"
                        /> brought to his office, and when she appeared he was smiling with as near
                        an approach to affability as his disposition would permit. He rose and bowed
                        like a courtier.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope you rested well, Mademoiselle,&quot; he said in his best
                        French. He imagined that the use of her language would be agreeable to begin
                        with.</p>
                    <p>The moment that Alice saw him wearing that shallow veneering of pleasantness
                        on his never prepossessing visage, she felt a mood of perversity come over
                        her. She, too, smiled, and he mistook her expression for one of reciprocal
                        amenity. She noticed that her sword was on his table.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am sorry, Monsieur, that I cannot say as much to you,&quot;
                        she glibly responded. &quot;If you lay upon a bed of needles the whole
                        night through, your rest was better than you deserved. My own sleep was
                        quite refreshing, thank you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Instantly Hamilton&apos;s choler rose. He tried to suppress it at first;
                        but when he saw Alice actually laughing, and Farnsworth (who had brought her
                        in) biting his lip furiously to keep from adding an uproarious guffaw, he
                        lost all hold of himself. He unconsciously picked up the rapier and shook it
                        till its blade swished.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I might have known better than to expect decency from a wench of
                        your character,&quot; he said. &quot;I hoped to do you a favor; but
                        I see that you are not capable of accepting kindness politely.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am sure, Monsieur, that I have but spoken the truth plainly to
                        you. You would not have me do otherwise, I hope.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-266" n="254"/>
                    <p>Her voice, absolutely witching in its softness, freshness and suavity, helped
                        the assault of her eyes, while her dimples twinkled and her hair shone.
                        Hamilton felt his heart move strangely; but he could not forbear saying in
                        English: &quot;If you are so devilish truthful, Miss, you will probably
                        tell me where the flag is that you stole and hid.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was always the missing banner that came to mind when he saw her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed I will do nothing of the sort,&quot; she promptly
                        replied. &quot;When you see that flag again you will be a prisoner and I
                        will wave it high over your head.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She lifted a hand as she spoke and made the motion of shaking a banner above
                        him. It was exasperation sweetened almost to delight that took hold of the
                        sturdy Briton. He liked pluck, especially in a woman; all the more if she
                        was beautiful. Yet the very fact that he felt her charm falling upon him set
                        him hard against her, not as Hamilton the man, but as Hamilton the commander
                        at Vincennes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think to fling yourself upon me as you have upon Captain
                        Farnsworth,&quot; he said, with an insulting leer and in a tone of
                        prurient innuendo. &quot;I am not susceptible, my dear.&quot; This
                        more for Farnsworth&apos;s benefit than to insult her, albeit he was not
                        in a mood to care.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are a coward and a liar!&quot; she exclaimed, her face
                        flushing with hot shame. &quot;You stand here,&quot; she quickly
                        added, turning fiercely upon Farnsworth, &quot;and quietly listen to
                        such words! You, too, are a coward <pb id="VAA2387-267" n="255"/> if you do
                        not make him retract! Oh, you English are low brutes!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton laughed; but Farnsworth looked dark and troubled, his glance going
                        back and forth from Alice to his commander, as if another word would cause
                        him to do something terrible.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I rather think I&apos;ve heard all that I care to hear from
                        you, Miss,&quot; Hamilton presently said. &quot;Captain Farnsworth,
                        you will see that the prisoner is confined in the proper place, which, I
                        suggest to you, is not your sleeping quarters, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Colonel Hamilton,&quot; said Farnsworth in a husky voice,
                        &quot;I slept on the ground under a shed last night in order that Miss
                        Roussillon might be somewhat comfortable.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Humph! Well, see that you do not do it again. This girl is guilty
                        of harboring a spy and resisting a lawful attempt of my guards to capture
                        him. Confine her in the place prepared for prisoners and see that she stays
                        there until I am ready to fix her punishment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is no place fit for a young girl to stay in,&quot;
                        Farnsworth ventured. &quot;She can have no comfort or&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take her along, sir; any place is good enough for her so long as
                        she behaves like a&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; Farnsworth bluntly interrupted, thus saving
                        Alice the stroke of a vile comparison. &quot;Come with me, please, Miss
                        Roussillon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He pulled her toward the door, then dropped the arm he had grasped and
                        murmured an apology.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-268" n="256"/>
                    <p>She followed him out, holding her head high. No one looking on would have
                        suspected that a sinking sensation in her heart made it difficult for her to
                        walk, or that her eyes, shining like stars, were so inwardly clouded with
                        distress that she saw her way but dimly.</p>
                    <p>It was a relief to Hamilton when Helm a few minutes later entered the room
                        with something breezy to say.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s up now, if I may ask?&quot; the jolly American
                        demanded. &quot;What&apos;s this I hear about trouble with the
                        French women? Have they begun a revolution?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That elephant, Gaspard Roussillon, came back into town last
                        night,&quot; said Hamilton sulkily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, he went out again, didn&apos;t he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stepped on somebody&apos;s toe first, eh?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The guard tried to capture him, and that girl of his wounded
                        Lieutenant Barlow in the neck with a sword. Roussillon fought like a tiger
                        and the men swear that the devil himself appeared on the scene to help the
                        Frenchman out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Moral: Be generous in your dealings with Frenchmen and Frenchwomen
                        and so get the devil on your side.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve got the girl a prisoner, and I swear to you that
                        I&apos;ll have her shot this time if&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not shoot her yourself? You oughtn&apos;t to shirk a dirty
                        job like that and force it upon your men.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton laughed and elevated his shoulders as if to shake off an annoying
                        load. Just then a young officer with a white bandage around his neck entered
                            <pb id="VAA2387-269" n="257"/> and saluted. He was a small, soft-haired,
                        blue-eyed man of reckless bearing, with marks of dissipation sharply cut
                        into his face. He saluted, smiling self-consciously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, Barlow,&quot; said Hamilton, &quot;the kitten
                        scratched you, did she?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, slightly, and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve been
                        treated fairly in the matter, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I stood the brunt and now Captain Farnsworth gets the
                        prize.&quot; He twisted his mouth in mock expression of maudlin
                        disappointment. &quot;I&apos;m always cheated out of the sweets. I
                        never get anything for gallant conduct on the field.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Poor boy! It is a shame. But I say, Lieutenant, has Roussillon
                        really escaped, or is he hidden somewhere in town? Have you been
                        careful?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, it&apos;s the Indians. They all swear by these Frenchmen.
                        You can&apos;t get any help from them against a fellow like Roussillon.
                        In fact they aid him; he&apos;s among them now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Moral again,&quot; Helm interposed; &quot;keep on the good
                        side of the French!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s sensible talk, sir,&quot; assented Barlow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bah!&quot; exclaimed Hamilton. &quot;You might as well talk
                        of keeping on the good side of the American traitorsa bloody murrain seize
                        the whole race!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s what I say,&quot; chimed in the Lieutenant,
                        with a sly look at Helm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They have been telling me a cock-and-bull story concerning the
                        affair at the Roussillon cabin,&quot; Hamilton <pb id="VAA2387-270"
                            n="258"/> said, changing his manner. &quot;What is this about a
                        disguised and wonderful man who rushed in and upset the whole of you. I want
                        no romancing; give me the facts.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Barlow&apos;s dissolute countenance became troubled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The facts,&quot; he said, speaking with serious deliberation,
                        &quot;are not clear. It was like a clap of thunder, the way that man
                        performed. As you say, he did fling the whole squad all of a heap, and it
                        was done that quickly,&quot; he snapped his thumb and finger
                        demonstratively with a sharp report; &quot;nobody could understand
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton looked at his subaltern with a smile of unlimited contempt and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;A pretty officer of His Majesty&apos;s army, you are,
                        Lieutenant Barlow! First a slip of a girl shows herself your superior with
                        the sword and wounds you, then a single man wipes up the floor of a house
                        with you and your guard, depriving you at the same time of both vision and
                        memory, so that you cannot even describe your assailant!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He was dressed like a priest,&quot; muttered Barlow, evidently
                        frightened at his commander&apos;s scathing comment. &quot;That was
                        all there was to see.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A priest! Some of the men say the devil. I wonder&quot;
                        Hamilton hesitated and looked at the floor. &quot;This Father Beret, he
                        is too old for such a thing, isn&apos;t he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have thought of himit was like himbut he is, as you say, very old
                        to be so tremendously strong and active. Why, I tell you that men went from
                        his hands <pb id="VAA2387-271" n="259"/> against the walls and floor as if
                        shot out of a mortar. It was the strangest and most astounding thing I ever
                        heard of.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A little later Barlow seized a favorable opportunity and withdrew. The
                        conversation was not to his liking.</p>
                    <p>Hmilton sent for Father Beret and hd a long talk with him, but the old man
                        looked so childishly inoffensive in spirit and so collapsed physically that
                        it seemed worse than foolishness to accuse him of the exploit over which the
                        entire garrison was wondering. Farnsworth sat by during the interview. He
                        looked the good priest curiously and critically over from head to foot,
                        remembering, but not mentioning, the most unclerical punch in the side
                        received from that energetic right arm now lying so flabbily across the old
                        man&apos;s lap.</p>
                    <p>When the talk ended and Father Beret humbly took his leave, Hamilton turned
                        to Farnsworth and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you think of this affair? I have cross-questioned all the
                        men who took part in it, and every one of them says simply priest or devil.
                        I think old Beret is both; but plainly he couldn&apos;t hurt a chicken,
                        you can see that at a glance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth smiled, rubbing his side reminiscently; but he shook his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sure it&apos;s puzzling, indeed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton sat in thoughtful silence for a while, then abruptly changed the
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think, Captain, that you had better send out Lieutenant Barlow
                        and some of the best woodsmen to kill some game. We need fresh venison, and,
                        by George! I&apos;m not going to depend upon these French traitors <pb
                            id="VAA2387-272" n="260"/> any longer. I have set my foot down;
                        they&apos;ve got to do better or take the consequences.&quot; He
                        paused for a breath, then added: &quot;That girl has done too much to
                        escape severest punishment. The garrison will be demoralized if this thing
                        goes on without an example of authority rigidly enforced. I am resolved that
                        there shall be a startling and effective public display of my power to
                        punish. She shot you; you seem to be glad of it, but it was a grave offence.
                        She has stabbed Barlow; that is another serious crime; but worst of all she
                        aided a spy and resisted arrest. She must be punished.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth knew Hamilton&apos;s nature, and he now saw that Alice was in
                        dreadful danger of death or something even worse. Whenever his chief talked
                        of discipline and the need of maintaining his authority, there was little
                        hope of softening his decisions. Moreover, the provocation to apply extreme
                        measures really seemed sufficient, regarded from a military point of view,
                        and Captain Farnsworth was himself, under ordinary circumstances, a
                        disciplinarian of the strictest class. The fascination, however, by which
                        Alice held him overbore every other influence, and his devotion to her
                        loosened every other tie and obligation to a most dangerous extent. No
                        sooner had he left headquarters and given Barlow his instructions touching
                        the hunting expedition, than his mind began to wander amid visions and
                        schemes by no means consistent with his military obligations. In order to
                        reflect undisturbed he went forth into the dreary, lane-like streets <pb
                            id="VAA2387-273" n="261"/> of Vincennes and walked aimlessly here and
                        there until he met Father Beret.</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth saluted the old man, and was passing him by, when seeing a sword
                        in his hand, half hidden in the folds of his worn and faded cassock, he
                        turned and addressed him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why are you armed this morning, Father?&quot; he demanded very
                        pleasantly. &quot;Who is to suffer now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not on the war-path, my son,&quot; replied the priest.
                        &quot;It is but a rapier that I am going to clean of rust spots that are
                        gathering on its blade.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it yours, Father? Let me see it.&quot; He held out his hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, not mine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret seemed not to notice Farnsworth&apos;s desire to handle the
                        weapon, and the young man, instead of repeating his words, reached farther,
                        nearly grasping the scabbard.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I cannot let you take it, my son,&quot; said Father Beret.
                        &quot;You have its mate, that should satisfy you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, Colonel Hamilton took it,&quot; Farnsworth quickly replied.
                        &quot;If I could I would gladly return it to its owner. I am not a
                        thief, Father, and I am ashamed of ofwhat I did when I was drunk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The priest looked sharply into Farnsworth&apos;s eyes and read there
                        something that reassured him. His long experience had rendered him adept at
                        taking a man&apos;s value at a glance. He slightly lifted his face and
                        said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, but the poor little girl! why do you persecute her? She really
                        does not deserve it. She is a noble <pb id="VAA2387-274" n="262"/> child.
                        Give her back to her home and her people. Do not soil and spoil her sweet
                        life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was the sing-song voice used by Father Beret in his sermons and prayers;
                        but something went with it indescribably touching. Farnsworth felt a lump
                        rise in his throat and his eyes were redy to show tears.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father,&quot; he said, with difficulty making his words
                        distinct, &quot;I would not harm Miss Roussillon to save my own life,
                        and I would do anything&quot; he paused slightly, then added with
                        passionate force; &quot;I would do anything, no matter what, to save her
                        from the terrible thing that now threatens her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret&apos;s countenance changed curiously as he gazed at the
                        young man and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you really mean what you say, you can easily save her, my
                        son.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father, by all that is holy, I mean just what I say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Swear not at all, my son, but give me your hand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The two men stood with a tight grip between them and exchanged a long,
                        steady, searching gaze.</p>
                    <p>A drizzling rain had begun to fall again, with a raw wind creeping from the
                        west.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come with me to my house, my son,&quot; Father Beret presently
                        added; and together they went, the priest covering Alice&apos;s sword

                    <p>Long-Hair stood not upon ceremony in conveying to Beverley the information
                        that he was to run the gauntlet, which, otherwise stated, meant that the
                        Indians would form themselves in two parallel lines facing each other about
                        six feet apart, and that the prisoner would be expected to run down the
                        length of the space between, thus affording the warriors an opportunity,
                        greatly coveted and relished by their fiendish natures, to beat him cruelly
                        during his flight. This sort of thing was to the Indians, indeed, an
                        exquisite amusement, as fascinating to them as the theater is to more
                        enlightened people. No sooner was it agreed upon that the entertainment
                        should again be undertaken than all the younger men began to scurry around
                        getting everything ready for it. Their faces glowed with a droll cruelty
                        strange to see, and they further expressed their lively expectations by
                        playful yet curiously solemn antics.</p>
                    <p>The preparations were simple and quickly made. Each man armed himself with a
                        stick three feet long and about three-quarters of an inch in diameter. Rough
                        weapons they were, cut from boughs of scrub-oak, knotty and tough as horn.
                        Long-Hair unbound Beverley and stripped his clothes from his body down to
                        the waist. Then the lines formed, the Indians in each row standing about as
                        far apart as the width of <pb id="VAA2387-276" n="264"/> the space in which
                        the prisoner was to run. This arrangement gave them free use of their sticks
                        and plenty of room for full swing of their lithe bodies.</p>
                    <p>In removing Beverley&apos;s clothes Long-Hair found Alice&apos;s
                        locket hanging over the young man&apos;s heart. He tor it rudely off and
                        grunted, glaring viciously, first at it, then at Beverley. He seemed to be
                        mightily wrought upon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;White man damn thief,&quot; he growled deep in his throat;
                        &quot;stole from little girl!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He put the locket in his pouch and resumed his stupidly indifferent
                        expression.</p>
                    <p>When everything was ready for the delightful entertainment to begin,
                        Long-Hair waved his tomahawk three times over Beverley&apos;s head, and
                        pointing down between the waiting lines said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ugh, run!&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Beverley did not budge. He was standing erect, with his arms, deeply
                        creased where the thongs had sunk, folded across his breast. A rush of
                        thoughts and feelings had taken tumultuous possession of him and he could
                        not move or decide what to do. A mad desire to escape arose in his heart the
                        moment that he saw Long-Hair take the locket. It was as if Alice had cried
                        to him and bidden him make a dash for liberty.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ugh, run!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The order was accompanied with a push of such violence from
                        Long-Hair&apos;s left elbow that Beverley plunged and fell, for his
                        limbs, after their long and painful confinement in the raw-hide bonds, were
                        stiff and almost useless. Long-Hair in no gentle voice bade <pb
                            id="VAA2387-277" n="265"/> him get up. The shock of falling seemed to
                        awaken his dormant forces; a sudden resolve leaped into his brain. He saw
                        that the Indians had put aside their bows and guns, most of which were
                        leaning against the boles of trees here and yonder. What if he could knock
                        Long-Hair down and run away? This might possibly be easy, considering the
                        Indian&apos;s broken arm. His heart jumped at the possibility. But the
                        shrewd savage was alert and saw the thought come into his face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You try git `way, kill dead!&quot; he snarled, lifting his
                        tomahawk ready for a stroke. &quot;Brains out, damn!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley glanced down the waiting and eager lines. Swiftly he speculated,
                        wondering what would be his chance for escape were he to break through. But
                        he did not take his own condition into account.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ugh, run!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again the elbow of Long-Hair&apos;s hurt arm pushed him toward the
                        expectant rows of Indians, who flourished their clubs and uttered impatient
                        grunts.</p>
                    <p>This time he did not fall; but in trying to run he limped stiffly at first,
                        his legs but slowly and imperfectly regaining their strength and suppleness
                        from the action. Just before reaching the lines, however, he stopped short.
                        Long-Hair, who was close behind him, took hold of his shoulder and led him
                        back to the starting place. The big Indian&apos;s arm must have given
                        him pain when he thus used it, but he did not wince. &quot;Foolkill
                        dead!&quot; he repeated two or three times, holding his tomahawk on high
                        with threatening motions and frequent repetitions of his one echo from <pb
                            id="VAA2387-278" n="266"/> the profanity of civilization. He was
                        beginning to draw his mouth down at the corners, and his eyes were narrowed
                        to mere slits.</p>
                    <p>Beverley understood now that he could not longer put off the trial. He must
                        choose between certain death and the torture of the gauntlet, as
                        frontiersmen named this savage ordeal. An old man might have preferred the
                        stroke of the hatchet to such an infliction as the clubs must afford,
                        considering that, even after all the agony, his captivity and suffering
                        would be only a little nearer its end. Youth, however, has faith in the turn
                        of fortune&apos;s wheel, and faith in itself, no matter how dark the
                        prospect. Hope blows her horn just over the horizon, and the strain bids the
                        young heart take courage and beat strong. Moreover, men were men, who led
                        the van in those days on the outmost lines of our march to the summit of the
                        world. Beverley was not more a hero than any other young, brave,
                        unconquerable patriot of the frontier army. His situation simply tried him a
                        trifle harder than was common. But it must be remembered that he had Love
                        with him, and where Love is there can be no cowardice, no surrender.</p>
                    <p>Long-Hair once again pushed him and said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ugh, run!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley made a direct dash for the narrow lane between the braced and
                        watchful lines. Every warrior lifted his club; every copper face gleamed
                        stolidly, a mask behind which burned a strangely atrocious spirit. The two
                        savages standing at the end nearest Beverley struck at him the instant he
                        reached them, but they <pb id="VAA2387-279" n="267"/> were taken quite by
                        surprise when he checked himself between them and, leaping this way and
                        that, swung out two powerful blows, left and right, stretching one of them
                        flat and sending the other reeling and staggering half a dozen paces
                        backward with the blood streaming from his nose.</p>
                    <p>This done, Beverley turned to run away, but his breath was already short and
                        his strength rapidly going.</p>
                    <p>Long-Hair, who was at his heels, leaped before him when he had gone but a few
                        steps and once more flourished the tomahawk. To struggle was useless, save
                        to insist upon being brained outright, which just then had no part in
                        Beverley&apos;s considerations. Long-Hair kicked his victim heavily,
                        uttering laconic curses meanwhile, and led him back again to the
                        starting-point.</p>
                    <p>A genuine sense of humor seems almost entirely lacking in the mind of the
                        American Indian. He smiles at things not in the least amusing to us and when
                        he laughs, which is very seldom, the cause of his merriment usually lies in
                        something repellantly cruel and inhuman. When Beverley struck his two
                        assailants, hurting them so that one lay half stunned, while the other spun
                        away from his fist with a smashed nose, all the rest of the Indians grunted
                        and laughed raucously in high delight. They shook their clubs, danced,
                        pointed at their discomfited fellows and twisted their painted faces into
                        knotted wrinkles, their eyes twinkling with devilish expression of glee
                        quite indescribable.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-280" n="268"/>
                    <p>&quot;Ugh, damn, run!&quot; said Long-Hair, this time adding a hard
                        kick to the elbow-shove he gave Beverley.</p>
                    <p>The young man, who had borne all he could, now turned upon him furiously and
                        struck straight from the shoulder, setting the whole weight of his body into
                        the blow. Long-Hair stepped out of the way and quick as a flash brought the
                        flat side of his tomahawk with great force against Beverley&apos;s head.
                        This gave the amusement a sudden and disappointing end, for the prisoner
                        fell limp and senseless to the ground. No more running the gauntlet for him
                        that day. Indeed it required protracted application of the best Indian skill
                        to revive him so that he could fairly be called a living man. There had been
                        no dangerous concussion, however, and on the following morning camp was
                        broken.</p>
                    <p>Beverley, sore, haggard, forlornly disheveled, had his arms bound again and
                        was made to march apace with his nimble enemies, who set out swiftly
                        eastward, their disappointment at having their sport cut short, although
                        bitter enough, not in the least indicated by any facial expression or
                        spiteful act.</p>
                    <p>Was it really a strange thing, or was it not, that Beverley&apos;s mind
                        now busied itself unceasingly with the thought that Long-Hair had
                        Alice&apos;s picture in his pouch? One might find room for discussion of
                        a cerebral problem like this; but our history cannot be delayed with
                        analyses and speculations; it must run its direct course unhindered to the
                        end. Suffice it to record that, while tramping at Long-Hair&apos;s side
                        and growing more and more desirous of seeing the picture <pb
                            id="VAA2387-281" n="269"/> again, Beverley began trying to converse with
                        his taciturn captor. He had a considerable smattering of several Indian
                        dialects, which he turned upon Long-Hair to the best of his ability, but
                        apparently without effect. Nevertheless he babbled at intervals, always upon
                        the same subject and always endeavoring to influence that huge, stolid,
                        heartless savage in the direction of letting him see again the child face of
                        the miniature.</p>
                    <p>A stone, one of our travel-scarred and mysterious western granite bowlders
                        brought from the far north by the ancient ice, would show as much sympathy
                        as did the face of Long-Hair. Once in a while he gave Beverley a soulless
                        glance and said &quot;damn&quot; with utter indifference. Nothing,
                        however, could quench or even in the slightest sense allay the
                        lover&apos;s desire. He talked of Alice and the locket with constantly
                        increasing volubility, saying over and over phrases of endearment in a
                        half-delirious way, not aware that fever was fermenting his blood and
                        heating his brain. Probably he would have been very ill but for the
                        tremendous physical exercise forced upon him. The exertion kept him in a
                        profuse perspiration and his robust constitution cast off the malarial
                        poison. Meantime he used every word and phrase, every grunt and gesture of
                        Indian dialect that he could recall, in the iterated and reiterated attempt
                        to make Long-Hair understand what he wanted.</p>
                    <p>When night came on again the band camped under some trees beside a swollen
                        stream. There was no rain falling, but almost the entire country lay under
                            <pb id="VAA2387-282" n="270"/> a flood of water. Fires of logs were soon
                        burning brightly on the comparatively dry bluff chosen by the Indians. The
                        weather was chill, but not cold. Long-Hair took great pains, however, to dry
                        Beverley&apos;s clothes and see that he had warm wraps and plenty to
                        eat. Hamilton&apos;s large reward would not be forthcoming should the
                        prisoner die. Beverley was good property, well worth careful attention. To
                        be sure his scalp, in the worst event, would command a sufficient
                        honorarium, but not the greatest. Beverley thought of all this while the big
                        Indian was wrapping him snugly in skins and blankets for the night, and
                        there was no comfort in it, save that possibly if he were returned to
                        Hamilton he might see Alice again before he died.</p>
                    <p>A fitful wind cried dolefully in the leafless treetops, the stream hard by
                        gave forth a rushing sound, and far away some wolves howled like lost souls.
                        Worn out, sore from head to foot, Beverley, deep buried in the blankets and
                        skins, soon fell into a profound sleep. The fires slowly crumbled and faded;
                        no sentinel was posted, for the Indians did not fear an attack, there being
                        no enemies that they knew of nearer than Kaskaskia. The camp slumbered as
                        one man.</p>
                    <p>At about the mid-hour of the night Long-Hair gently awoke his prisoner by
                        drawing a hand across his face, then whispered in his ear:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Damn, still!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley tried to rise, uttering a sleepy ejaculation under his breath.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No talk,&quot; hissed Long-Hair. &quot;Still!&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was something in his voice that not only <pb id="VAA2387-283" n="271"/>
                        swept the last film of sleep out of Beverley&apos;s brain, but made it
                        perfectly clear to him that a very important bit of craftiness was being
                        performed; just what its nature was, however, he could not surmise. One
                        thing was obvious, Long-Hair did not wish the other Indians to know of the
                        move he was making. Deftly he slipped the blankets from around Beverley, and
                        cut the thongs at his ankles.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Still!&quot; he whispered. &quot;Come
                        &apos;long.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Under such circumstances a competent mind acts with lightning celerity.
                        Beverley now understood that Long-Hair was stealing him away from the other
                        savages and that the big villain meant to cheat them out of their part of
                        the reward. Along with this discovery came a fresh gleam of hope. It would
                        be far easier to escape from one Indian than from nearly a score. Ah, he
                        would follow Long-Hair, indeed he would! The needed courage came with the
                        thought, and so with immense labor he crept at the heels of that crawling
                        monster. It was a painful process, for his arms were still fast bound at the
                        wrists with the rawhide strings; but what was pain to him? He shivered with
                        joy, thinking of what might happen. The voice of the wind overhead and the
                        noisy bubbling of the stream near by were cheerful and cheering sounds to
                        him now. So much can a mere shadow of hope do for a human soul on the verge
                        of despair! Already he was planning or trying to plan some way by which he
                        could kill Long-Hair when they should reach a safe distance from the
                        sleeping camp.</p>
                    <p>But how could the thing be done? A man with his <pb id="VAA2387-284" n="272"
                        /> hands tied, though they are in front of him, is in no excellent condition
                        to cope with a free and stalwart savage armed to the teeth. Still
                        Beverley&apos;s spirits rose with every rod of distance that was added
                        to their slow progress.</p>
                    <p>Their course was nearly parallel with that of the stream, but slightly
                        converging toward it, and after they had gone about a furlong they reached
                        the bank. Here Long-Hair stopped and, without a word, cut the thongs from
                        Beverley&apos;s wrists. This was astounding; the young man could
                        scarcely realize it, nor was he ready to act.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Swim water,&quot; Long-Hair said in a guttural murmur barely
                        audible. &quot;Swim, damn!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again it was necessary for Beverley&apos;s mind to act swiftly and with
                        prudence. The camp was yet within hailing distance. A false move now would
                        bring the whole pack howling to the rescue. Something told him to do as
                        Long-Hair ordered, so with scarcely a perceptible hesitation he scrambled
                        down the bushy bank and slipped into the water, followed by Long-Hair, who
                        seized him by one arm when he began to swim, and struck out with him into
                        the boiling and tumbling current.</p>
                    <p>Beverley had always thought himself a master swimmer, but Long-Hair showed
                        him his mistake. The giant Indian, with but one hand free to use, fairly
                        rushed through that deadly cold and turbulent water, bearing his prisoner
                        with him despite the wounded arm, as easily as if towing him at the stern of
                        a pirogue. True, his course was down stream for a considerable <pb
                            id="VAA2387-285" n="273"/> distance, but even when presently he struck
                        out boldly for the other bank, breasting a current in which few swimmers
                        could have lived, much less made headway, he still swung forward rapidly,
                        splitting the waves and scarcely giving Beverley freedom enough so that he
                        could help in the progress. It was a long, cold struggle, and when at last
                        they touched the sloping low bank on the other side, Long-Hair had fairly to
                        lift his chilled and exhausted prisoner to the top.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ugh, cold,&quot; he grunted, beginning to pound and rub
                        Beverley&apos;s arms, legs and body. &quot;Make warm, damn
                        heap!&quot;</p>
                    <p>All this he did with his right hand, holding the tomahawk in his left.</p>
                    <p>It was a strange, bewildering experience out of which the young man could not
                        see in any direction far enough to give him a hint upon which to act. In a
                        few minutes Long-Hair jerked him to his feet and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was just light enough to see that the order had a tomahawk to enforce it
                        withal. Long-Hair indicated the direction and drove Beverley onward as fast
                        as he could.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Try run &apos;way, kill, damn!&quot; he kept repeating,
                        while with his left hand on the young man&apos;s shoulder he guided him
                        from behind dexterously through the wood for some distance. Then he stopped
                        and grunted, adding his favorite expletive, which he used with not the least
                        knowledge of its meaning. To him the syllable &quot;damn&quot; was
                        but a mouthful of forcible wind.</p>
                    <p>They had just emerged from a thicket into an open <pb id="VAA2387-286"
                            n="274"/> space, where the ground was comparatively dry. Overhead the
                        stars were shining in great clusters of silver and gold against a dark,
                        cavernous looking sky, here and there overrun with careering black clouds.
                        Beverley shivered, not so much with cold as on account of the stress of
                        excitement which amounted to nervous rigor. Long-Hair faced him and leaned
                        toward him, until his breathing was audible and his massive features were
                        dimly outlined. A dragon of the darkest age could not have been more
                        repulsive.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ugh, friend, damn!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley started when these words were followed by a sentence in an Indian
                        dialect somewhat familiar to him, a dialect in which he had tried to talk
                        with Long-Hair during the day&apos;s march. The sentence, literally
                        translated, was:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Long-Hair is friendly now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A blow in the face could not have been so surprising. Beverley not only
                        started, but recoiled as if from a sudden and deadly apparition. The step
                        between supreme exhilaration and utter collapse is now and then
                        infinitesimal. There are times, moreover, when an expression on the face of
                        Hope makes her look like the twin sister of Despair. The moment falling just
                        after Long-Hair spoke was a century condensed in a breath.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Long-Hair is friendly now; will white man be friendly?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley heard, but the speech seemed to come out of vastness and hollow
                        distance; he could not realize it fairly. He felt as if in a dream, far off
                        somewhere <pb id="VAA2387-287" n="275"/> in loneliness, with a big, shadowy
                        form looming before him. He heard the chill wind in the thickets round
                        about, and beyond Long-Hair rose a wall of giant trees.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ugh, not understand?&quot; the savage presently demanded in his
                        broken English.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said Beverley, &quot;I
                        understand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is the white man friendly now?&quot; Long-Hair then repeated in
                        his own tongue, with a certain insistence of manner and voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, friendly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley said this absently in a tone of perfunctory dryness. His throat was
                        parched, his head seemed to waver. But he was beginning to comprehend that
                        Long-Hair, for some inscrutable reason of his own, was desirous of making a
                        friendship between them. Thought was bewildering.</p>
                    <p>Long-Hair fumbled in his pouch and took out Alice&apos;s locket, which he
                        handed to Beverley. &quot;White man love little girl?&quot; he
                        inquired in a tone that bordered upon tenderness, again speaking in Indian.</p>
                    <p>Beverley clutched the disk as soon as he saw it gleam in the star-light.</p>
                    <p>&quot;White man going to have little girl for his squaweh?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; cried Beverley without hearing his own voice.
                        He was trying to open the locket but his hands were numb and trembling. When
                        at last he did open it he could not see the child face within, for now even
                        the star-light was shut off by a scudding black cloud.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-288" n="276"/>
                    <p>&quot;Little girl saved Long-Hair&apos;s life. Long-Hair save white
                        warrior for little girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A dignity which was almost noble accompanied these simple sentences.
                        Long-Hair stood proudly erect, like a colossal dark statue in the dimness.</p>
                    <p>The great truth dawned upon Beverley that here was a characteristic act. He
                        knew that an Indian rarely failed to repay a kindness or an injury, stroke
                        for stroke, when opportunity offered. Long-Hair was a typical Indian. That
                        is to say, a type of inhumanity raised to the last power; but under his
                        hideous atrocity of nature lay the indestructible sense of gratitude so
                        fixed and perfect that it did its work almost automatically.</p>
                    <p>It must be said, and it may or may not be to the white man&apos;s shame,
                        that Beverley did not respond with absolute promptness and sincerity to
                        Long-Hair&apos;s generosity. He had suffered terribly at the hands of
                        this savage. His arms and legs were raw from the biting of the thongs; his
                        body ached from the effect of blows and kicks laid upon him while bound and
                        helpless. Perhaps he was not a very emotional man. At all events there was
                        no sudden recognition of the favor he was receiving. And this pleased
                        Long-Hair, for the taste of the American Indian delights in immobility of
                        countenance and reserve of feeling under great strain.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait here a little while,&quot; Long-Hair presently said, and
                        without lingering for reply, turned away and disappeared in the wood.
                        Beverley was free to run if he wished to, and the thought did surge across
                        his mind; <pb id="VAA2387-289" n="277"/> but a restraining something, like a
                        hand laid upon him, would not let his limbs move. Down deep in his heart a
                        calm voice seemed to be repeating Long-Hair&apos;s Indian
                        sentence&quot;Wait here a little while.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A few minutes later Long-Hair returned bearing two guns, Beverley&apos;s
                        and his own, the latter, a superb weapon given him by Hamilton. He afterward
                        explained that he had brought these, with their bullet-pouches and
                        powder-horns, to a place of concealment near by before he awoke Beverley.
                        This meant that he had swum the cold river three times since nightfall; once
                        over with the guns and accouterments; once back to camp, then over again
                        with Beverley! All this with a broken arm, and to repay Alice for her
                        kindness to him.</p>
                    <p>Beverley may have been slow, but at last his appreciation was, perhaps, all
                        the more profound. As best he could he expressed it to Long-Hair, who showed
                        no interest whatever in the statement. Instead of responding in Indian, he
                        said &quot;damn&quot; without emphasis. It was rather as if he had
                        yawned absently, being bored.</p>
                    <p>Delay could not be thought of. Long-Hair explained briefly that he thought
                        Beverley must go to Kaskaskia. He had come across the stream in the
                        direction of Vincennes in order to set his warriors at fault. The stream
                        must be recrossed, he said, farther down, and he would help Beverley a
                        certain distance on his way, then leave him to shift for himself. He had a
                        meager amount of parched corn and buffalo meat <pb id="VAA2387-290" n="278"
                        /> in his pouch, which would stay hunger until they could kill some game.
                        Now they must go.</p>
                    <p>The resilience of a youthful and powerful physique offers many a problem to
                        the biologist. Vital force seems to find some mysterious reservoir of
                        nourishment hidden away in the nerve-centers. Beverley set out upon that
                        seemingly impossible undertaking with renewed energy. It could not have been
                        the ounce of parched corn and bit of jerked venison from which he drew so
                        much strength; but on the other hand, could it have been the miniature of
                        Alice, which he felt pressing over his heart once more, that afforded a
                        subtle stimulus to both mind and body? They flung miles behind them before
                        day-dawn, Long-Hair leading, Beverley pressing close at his heels. Most of
                        the way led over flat prairies covered with water, and they therefore left
                        no track by which they could be followed.</p>
                    <p>Late in the forenoon Long-Hair killed a deer at the edge of a wood. Here they
                        made a fire and cooked a supply which would last them for a day or two, and
                        then on they went again. But we cannot follow them step by step. When
                        Long-Hair at last took leave of Beverley, the occasion had no ceremony. It
                        was an abrupt, unemotional parting. The stalwart Indian simply said in his
                        own dialect, pointing westward:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go that way two days. You will find your friends.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then, without another look or word, he turned about and stalked eastward at a
                        marvelously rapid gait. In his mind he had a good tale to tell his warrior
                        companions when he should find them again: <pb id="VAA2387-291" n="279"/>
                        how Beverley escaped that night and how he followed him a long, long chase,
                        only to lose him at last under the very guns of the fort at Kaskaskia. But
                        before he reached his band an incident of some importance changed his story
                        to a considerable degree. It chanced that he came upon Lieutenant Barlow,
                        who, in pursuit of game, had lost his bearings and, far from his companions,
                        was beating around quite bewildered in a watery solitude. Long-Hair promptly
                        murdered the poor fellow and scalped him with as little compunction as he
                        would have skinned a rabbit; for he had a clever scheme in his head, a very
                        audacious and outrageous scheme, by which he purposed to recoup, to some
                        extent, the damages sustained by letting Beverley go.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, when he rejoined his somewhat disheartened and demoralized band he
                        showed them the scalp and gave them an eloquent account of how he tore it
                        from Beverley&apos;s head after a long chase and a bloody hand to hand
                        fight. They listened, believed, and were satisfied.</p>

                    <p>The room in which Alice was now imprisoned formed part of the upper story of
                        a building erected by Hamilton in one of the four angles of the stockade. It
                        had no windows and but two oblong port-holes made to accommodate a small
                        swivel, which stood darkly scowling near the middle of the floor. From one
                        of these apertures Alice could see the straggling roofs and fences of the
                        dreary little town, while from the other a long reach of watery prairie,
                        almost a lake, lay under view with the rolling, muddy Wabash gleaming
                        beyond. There seemed to be no activity of garrison or townspeople. Few
                        sounds broke the silence of which the cheerless prison room seemed to be the
                        center.</p>
                    <p>Alice felt all her courage and cheerfulness leaving her. She was alone in the
                        midst of enemies. No father or mother, no frienda young girl at the mercy of
                        soldiers, who could not be expected to regard her with any sympathy beyond
                        that which is accompanied with repulsive leers and hints. Day after day her
                        loneliness and helplessness became more agonizing. Farnsworth, it is true,
                        did all he could to relieve the strain of her situation; but Hamilton had an
                        eye upon what passed and soon interfered. He administered a bitter
                        reprimand, under which his subordinate writhed in speechless anger and
                        resentment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Finally, Captain Farnsworth,&quot; he said in conclusion, <pb
                            id="VAA2387-293" n="281"/> &quot;you will distinctly understand that
                        this girl is my prisoner, not yours; that I, not you, will direct how she is
                        to be held and treated, and that hereafter I will suffer no interference on
                        your part. I hope you fully understand me, sir, and will govern yourself
                        accordingly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Smarting, or rather smothering, under the outrageous insult of these remarks,
                        Farnsworth at first determined to fling his resignation at the
                        Governor&apos;s feet and then do whatever desperate thing seemed most to
                        his mood. But a soldier&apos;s training is apt to call a halt before the
                        worst befalls in such a case. Moreover, in the present temptation,
                        Farnsworth had a special check and hindrance. He had had a conference with
                        Father Beret, in which the good priest had played the part of wisdom in
                        slippers, and of gentleness more dove-like than the dove&apos;s. A very
                        subtle impression, illuminated with the &quot;hope that withers
                        hope,&quot; had come of that interview; and now Farnsworth felt its
                        restraint. He therefore saluted Hamilton formally and walked away.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret&apos;s paternal love for Alice,we cannot characterize it
                        more nicely than to call it paternal,was his justification for a certain
                        mild sort of corruption insinuated by him into the heart of Farnsworth. He
                        was a crafty priest, but his craft was always used for a good end.
                        Unquestionably Jesuitic was his mode of circumventing the young
                        man&apos;s military scruples by offering him a puff of fair weather with
                        which to sail toward what appeared to be the shore of delight. He saw at a
                        glance that Farnsworth&apos;s love for Alice was <pb id="VAA2387-294"
                            n="282"/> a consuming passion in a very ardent yet decidedly weak heart.
                        Here was the worldly lever with which Father Beret hoped to raze
                        Alice&apos;s prison and free her from the terrible doom with which she
                        was threatened.</p>
                    <p>The first interview was at Father Beret&apos;s cabin, to which, as will
                        be remembered, the priest and Farnsworth went after their meeting in the
                        street. It actually came to nothing, save an indirect understanding but half
                        suggested by Father Beret and never openly sanctioned by Captain Farnsworth.
                        The talk was insinuating on the part of the former, while the latter slipped
                        evasively from every proposition, as if not able to consider it on account
                        of a curious obtuseness of perception. Still, when they separated they shook
                        hands and exchanged a searching look perfectly satisfactory to both.</p>
                    <p>The memory of that interview with the priest was in Farnsworth&apos;s
                        mind when, boiling with rage, he left Hamilton&apos;s presence and went
                        forth into the chill February air. He passed out through the postern and
                        along the sodden and queachy edge of the prairie, involuntarily making his
                        way to Father Beret&apos;s cabin. His indignation was so great that he
                        trembled from head to foot at every step. The door of the place was open and
                        Father Beret was eating a frugal meal of scones and sour wine (of his own
                        make, he said), which he hospitably begged to share with his visitor. A fire
                        smouldered on the hearth, and a flat stone showed, by the grease smoking
                        over its hot surface, where the cakes had been baked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come in, my son,&quot; said the priest, &quot;and try the
                        fare <pb id="VAA2387-295" n="283"/> of a poor old man. It is plain, very
                        plain, but good.&quot; He smacked his lips sincerely and fingered
                        another scone. &quot;Take some, take some.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth was not tempted. The acid bouquet of the wine filled the room with
                        a smack of vinegar, and the smoke from rank scorching fat and wheat meal did
                        not suggest an agreeable feast.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, well, if you are not hungry, my son, sit down on the stool
                        there and tell me the news.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth took the low seat without a word, letting his eyes wander over the
                        walls. Alice&apos;s rapier, the mate to that now worn by Hamilton, hung
                        in its curiously engraved scabbard near one corner. The sight of it inflamed
                        Farnsworth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s an outrage,&quot; he broke forth.
                        &quot;Governor Hamilton sent a man to Roussillon place with orders to
                        bring him the scabbard of Miss Roussillon&apos;s sword, and he now wears
                        the beautiful weapon as if he had come by it honestly. Damn him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My dear, dear son, you must not soil your lips with such
                        language!&quot; Father Beret let fall the half of a well bitten cake and
                        held up both hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I beg your pardon, Father; I know I ought to be more careful in
                        your presence; butbutthe beastly, hellish scoundrel&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Bah! doucement, mon fils, doucement.</hi>&quot;
                        The old man shook his head and his finger while speaking. &quot;Easy, my
                        son, easy. You would be a fine target for bullets were your words to reach
                        Hamilton&apos;s ears. You are not permitted to revile your
                        commander.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-296" n="284"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I know; but how can a man restrain himself under such
                        abominable conditions?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret shrewdly guessed that Hamilton had been giving the Captain fresh
                        reason for bitter resentment. Moreover, he was sure that the moving cause
                        had been Alice. So, in order to draw out what he wished to hear, he said
                        very gently:</p>
                    <p>&quot;How is the little prisoner getting along?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth ground his teeth and swore; but Father Beret appeared not to hear;
                        he bit deep into a scone, took a liberal sip of the muddy red wine and
                        added:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Has she a comfortable place? Do you think Governor Hamilton would
                        let me visit her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is horrible!&quot; Farnsworth blurted.
                        &quot;She&apos;s penned up as if she were a dangerous beast, the
                        poor girl. And that damned scoundrel&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Son, son!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, it&apos;s no use to try, I can&apos;t help it, Father.
                        The whelp&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We can converse more safely and intelligently if we avoid
                        profanity, and undue emotion, my son. Now, if you will quit swearing, I
                        will, and if you will be calm, so will I.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth felt the sly irony of this absurdly vicarious proposition. Father
                        Beret smiled with a kindly twinkle in his deep-set eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, if you don&apos;t use profane language, Father,
                        there&apos;s no telling how much you think in expletives. What is your
                        opinion of a man who tumbles a poor, defenseless girl into prison and then
                        refuses to let her <pb id="VAA2387-297" n="285"/> be decently cared for? How
                        do you express yourself about him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My son, men often do things of which they ought to be ashamed. I
                        heard of a young officer once who maltreated a little girl that he met at
                        night in the street. What evil he would have done, had not a passing
                        kind-hearted man reminded him of his honor by a friendly punch in the ribs,
                        I dare not surmise.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;True, and your sarcasm goes home as hard as your fist did, Father.
                        I know that I&apos;ve been a sad dog all my life. Miss Roussillon saved
                        you by shooting me, and I love her for it. Lay on, Father, I deserve more
                        than you can give me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Surely you do, my son, surely you do; but my love for you will not
                        let me give you pain. Ah, we priests have to carry all men&apos;s loads.
                        Our backs are broad, however, very broad, my son.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And your fists devilish heavy, Father, devilish heavy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The gentle smile again flickered over the priest&apos;s weather-beaten
                        face as he glanced sidewise at Farns-worth and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sometimes, sometimes, my son, a carnal weapon must break the way
                        for a spiritual one. But we priests rarely have much physical strength; our
                        dependence is upon&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To be sure; certainly,&quot; Farnsworth interrupted, rubbing
                        his side, &quot;your dependence is upon the first thing that offers.
                        I&apos;ve had many a blow; but yours was the solidest that ever jarred
                        my mortal frame, Father Beret.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-298" n="286"/>
                    <p>The twain began to laugh. There is nothing like a reminiscence to stir up
                        fresh mutual sympathy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If your intercostals were somewhat sore for a time, on account of a
                        contact with priestly knuckles, doubtless there soon set in a corresponding
                        uneasiness in the region of your conscience. Such shocks are often
                        vigorously alterative and toniceh, my son?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You jolted me sober, Father, and then I was ashamed of myself. But
                        where does all your tremendous strength lie? You don&apos;t look
                        strong.&quot;</p>
                    <p>While speaking Farnsworth leaned near Father Beret and grasped his arm. The
                        young man started, for his fingers, instead of closing around a flabby,
                        shrunken old man&apos;s limb, spread themselves upon a huge, knotted
                        mass of iron muscles. With a quick movement Father Beret shook off
                        Farnsworth&apos;s hand, and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am no Samson, my son. <hi rend="i">Non sum qualis
                        eram.</hi>&quot; Then, as if dismissing a light subject for a graver
                        one, he sighed and added; &quot;I suppose there is nothing that can be
                        done for little Alice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He called the tall, strong girl &quot;little Alice,&quot; and so she
                        seemed to him. He could not, without direct effort, think of her as a
                        magnificently maturing woman. She had always been his spoiled pet child,
                        perversely set against the Holy Church, but dear to him nevertheless.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I came to you to ask that very question, Father,&quot; said
                        Farnsworth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what do I know? Surely, my son, you see <pb id="VAA2387-299"
                            n="287"/> how utterly helpless an old priest is against all you British.
                        And besides&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father Beret,&quot; Farnsworth huskily interrupted,
                        &quot;is there a place that you know of anywhere in which Miss
                        Roussillon could be hidden, if&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My dear son.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, Father, I mean it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mean what? Pardon an old man&apos;s slow understanding. What
                        are you talking about, my son?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret glanced furtively about, then quickly stepped through the
                        doorway, walked entirely around the house and came in again before
                        Farnsworth could respond. Once more seated on his stool he added
                        interrogatively:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you think you heard something moving outside?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You were saying something when I went out. Pardon my
                        interruption.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth gave the priest a searching and not wholly confiding look.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You did not interrupt me, Father Beret. I was not speaking. Why are
                        you so watchful? Are you afraid of eavesdroppers?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You were speaking recklessly. Your words were incendiary: <hi
                            rend="i">ardentia verba.</hi> My son, you were suggesting a dangerous
                        thing. Your life would scarcely satisfy the law were you convicted of
                        insinuating such treason. What if one of your prowling guards had overheard
                        you? Your neck and mine might feel the <pb id="VAA2387-300" n="288"/>
                        halter. <hi rend="i">Quod avertat dominus.&quot;</hi> He crossed himself
                        and in a solemn voice added in English:</p>
                    <p>&quot;May the Lord forbid! Ah, my son, we priests protect those we
                        love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I, who am not fit to tie a priest&apos;s shoe, do likewise.
                        Father, I love Alice Roussillon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Love is a holy thing, my son. <hi rend="i">Amare divinum est et
                            humanum.&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Father Beret, can you help me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Spiritually speaking, my son?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean, can you hide Mademoiselle Roussillon in some safe place, if
                        I take her out of the prison yonder? That&apos;s just what I mean. Can
                        you do it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your question is a remarkable one. Have you thought upon it from
                        all directions, my son? Think of your position, your duty as an
                        officer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A shrewd polemical expression beamed from Father Beret&apos;s eyes, and a
                        very expert physiogomist might have suspected duplicity from certain lines
                        about the old man&apos;s mouth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I simply know that I cannot stand by and see Alice Mademoiselle
                        Roussillon, forced to suffer treatment too beastly for an Indian thief.
                        That&apos;s the only direction there is for me to look at it from, and
                        you can understand my feelings if you will; you know that very well, Father
                        Beret. When a man loves a girl, he loves her; that&apos;s the whole
                        thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The quiet, inscrutable half-smile flickered once more on Father
                        Beret&apos;s face; but he sat silent some time with a sinewy forefinger
                        lying alongside his nose. When at last he spoke it was in a tone of voice
                        indicative <pb id="VAA2387-301" n="289"/> of small interest in what he was
                        saying. His words rambled to their goal with the effect of happy accident.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There are places in this neighborhood in which a human being would
                        be as hard to find as the flag that you and Governor Hamilton have so
                        diligently and unsuccessfully been in quest of for the past month or two.
                        Really, my son, this is a mysterious little town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth&apos;s eyes widened and a flush rose in his swarthy cheeks.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Damn the flag!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Let it lie hidden
                        forever; what do I care? I tell you, Father Beret, that Alice Roussillon is
                        in extreme danger. Governor Hamilton means to put some terrible punishment
                        on her. He has a devil&apos;s vindictiveness. He showed it to me clearly
                        awhile ago.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You showed something of the same sort to me, once upon a time, my
                        son.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I did, Father Beret, and I got a load of slugs in my shoulder
                        for it from that brave girl&apos;s pistol. She saved your life. Now I
                        ask you to help me save hers; or, if not her life, what is infinitely more,
                        her honor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Her honor!&quot; cried Father Beret, leaping to his feet so
                        suddenly and with such energy that the cabin shook from base to roof.
                        &quot;What do you say, Captain Farnsworth? What do you mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man was transformed. His face was terrible to see, with its narrow,
                        burning eyes deep under the shaggy brows, its dark veins writhing snakelike
                        on the temples and forehead, the projected mouth and <pb id="VAA2387-302"
                            n="290"/> chin, the hard lines of the jaws, the iron-gray gleam from all
                        the featureshe looked like an aged tiger stiffened for a spring.</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth was made of right soldierly stuff; but he felt a distinct shiver
                        flit along his back. His past life had not lacked thrilling adventures and
                        strangely varied experiences with desperate men. Usually he met sudden
                        emergencies rather calmly, sometimes with phlegmatic indifference. This
                        passionate outburst on the priest&apos;s part, however, surprised him
                        and awed him, while it stirred his heart with a profound sympathy unlike
                        anything he had ever felt before.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret mastered himself in a moment, and passing his hand over his
                        face, as if to brush away the excitement, sat down again on his stool. He
                        appeared to collapse inwardly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must excuse the weakness of an old man, my son,&quot; he
                        said, in a voice hoarse and shaking. &quot;But tell me what is going to
                        be done with Alice. Your wordswhat you saidI did not understand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He rubbed his forehead slowly, as one who has difficulty in trying to collect
                        his thoughts.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not know what Governor Hamilton means to do, Father Beret. It
                        will be something devilish, however,something that must not
                        happen,&quot; said Farnsworth.</p>
                    <p>Then he recounted all that Hamilton had done and said. He described the
                        dreary and comfortless room in which Alice was confined, the miserable fare
                        given her, and how she would be exposed to the leers and low remarks of the
                        soldiers. She had already suffered <pb id="VAA2387-303" n="291"/> these
                        things, and now that she could no longer have any protection, what was to
                        become of her? He did not attempt to overstate the case; but presented it
                        with a blunt sincerity which made a powerfully realistic impression.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret, like most men of strong feeling who have been subjected to long
                        years of trial, hardship, multitudinous dangers and all sorts of temptation,
                        and who have learned the lessons of self-control, had an iron will, and also
                        an abiding distrust of weak men. He saw Farnsworth&apos;s sincerity; but
                        he had no faith in his constancy, although satisfied that while resentment
                        of Hamilton&apos;s imperiousness lasted, he would doubtless remain firm
                        in his purpose to aid Alice. Let that wear off, as in a short time it would,
                        and then what? The old man studied his companion with eyes that slowly
                        resumed their expression of smouldering and almost timid geniality. His
                        priestly experience with desperate men was demanding of him a proper regard
                        for that subtlety of procedure which had so often compassed most difficult
                        ends.</p>
                    <p>He listened in silence to Farnsworth&apos;s story. When it came to an end
                        he began to offer some but half relevant suggestions in the form of indirect
                        cross-questions, by means of which he gradually drew out a minute
                        description of Alice&apos;s prison, the best way to reach it, the nature
                        of its door-fastenings, where the key was kept, and everything, indeed,
                        likely to be helpful to one contemplating a jail delivery. Farnsworth was
                        inwardly delighted. He felt Father <pb id="VAA2387-304" n="292"/>
                        Beret&apos;s cunning approach to the central object and his crafty
                        method of gathering details.</p>
                    <p>The shades of evening thickened in the stuffy cabin room while the
                        conversation went on. Father Beret presently lifted a puncheon in one corner
                        of the floor and got out a large bottle, which bore a mildewed and faded
                        French label, and with it a small iron cup. There was just light enough left
                        to show a brownish sparkle when, after popping out the cork, he poured a
                        draught in the fresh cup and in his own.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We may think more clearly, my son, if we taste this old liquor. I
                        have kept it a long while to offer upon a proper occasion. The occasion is
                        here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A ravishing bouquet quickly imbued the air. It was itself an intoxication.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Brothers of St. Martin distilled this liquor,&quot; Father
                        Beret added, handing the cup to Farnsworth, &quot;not for common social
                        drinking, my son, but for times when a man needs extraordinary stimulation.
                        It is said to be surpassingly good, because St. Martin blessed the
                        vine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The doughty Captain felt a sudden and imperious thirst seize his throat. The
                        liquor flooded his veins before his lips touched the cup. He had been
                        abstaining lately; now his besetting appetite rushed upon him. At one gulp
                        he took in the fiery yet smooth and captivating draught. Nor did he notice
                        that Father Beret, instead of joining him in the potation, merely lifted his
                        cup and set it down again, smacking his lips with gusto.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-305" n="293"/>
                    <p>There followed a silence, during which the aromatic breath of the bottle
                        increased its dangerous fascination. Then Father Beret again filled
                        Farnsworth&apos;s cup and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, the blessed monks, little thought they that their matchless
                        brew would ever be sipped in a poor missionary&apos;s hut on the Wabash!
                        But, after all, my son, why not here as well as in sunny France? Our object
                        justifies any impropriety of time and place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are right, Father. I drink to our object. Yes, I say, to our
                        object.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In fact, the drinking preceded his speech, and his tongue already had a loop
                        in it. The liquor stole through him, a mist of bewildering and enchanting
                        influence. The third cup broke his sentences into unintelligible fragments;
                        the fourth made his underjaw sag loosely, the fifth and sixth, taken in
                        close succession, tumbled him limp on the floor, where he slept blissfully
                        all night long, snugly covered with some of Father Beret&apos;s bed
                        clothes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Per casum obliquum, et per indirectum,&quot;</hi>
                        muttered the priest, when he had returned the bottle and cup to their
                        hiding-place. &quot;The end justifies the means. Sleep well, my son. Ah,
                        little Alice, little Alice, your old Father will trywill try!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He fumbled along the wall in the dark until he found the rapier, which he
                        took down; then he went out and sat for some time motionless beside the
                        door, while the clouds thickened overhead. It was late when he arose and
                        glided away shadow-like toward the fort, over which the night hung black,
                        chill and drearily <pb id="VAA2387-306" n="294"/> silent. The moon was still
                        some hours high, but smothered by the clouds; a fog slowly drifted from the
                        river.</p>
                    <p>Meantime Hamilton and Helm had spent a part of the afternoon and evening, as
                        usual, at cards. Helm broke off the game and went to his quarters rather
                        early for him, leaving the Governor alone and in a bad temper, because
                        Farnsworth, when he had sent for him, could not be found. Three times his
                        orderly returned in as many hours with the same report; the Captain had not
                        been seen or heard of. Naturally this sudden and complete disappearance,
                        immediately after the reprimand, suggested to Hamilton an unpleasant
                        possibility. What if Farnsworth had deserted him? Down deep in his heart he
                        was conscious that the young man had good cause for almost any desperate
                        action. To lose Captain Farnsworth, however, would be just now a calamity.
                        The Indians were drifting over rapidly to the side of the Americans, and
                        every day showed that the French could not long be kept quiet.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton sat for some time after Helm&apos;s departure, thinking over
                        what he now feared was a foolish mistake. Presently he buckled on
                        Alice&apos;s rapier, which he had lately been wearing as his own, and
                        went out into the main area of the stockade. A sentinel was tramping to and
                        fro at the gate, where a hazy lantern shone. The night was breathless and
                        silent. Hamilton approached the soldier on duty and asked him if he had seen
                        Captain Farnsworth, and receiving a negative <pb id="VAA2387-307" n="295"/>
                        reply, turned about puzzled and thoughtful to walk back and forth in the
                        chill, foggy air.</p>
                    <p>Presently a faint yellow light attracted his attention. It shone through a
                        porthole in an upper room of the block-house at the farther angle of the
                        stockade. In fact, Alice was reading by a sputtering lamp a book Farnsworth
                        had sent her, a volume of Ronsard that he had picked up in Canada. Hamilton
                        made his way in that direction, at first merely curious to know who was
                        burning oil so late; but after a few paces he recognized where the light
                        came from, and instantly suspected that Captain Farnsworth was there. Indeed
                        he felt sure of it. Somehow he could not regard Alice as other than a saucy
                        hoyden, incapable of womanly virtue. His experience with the worst element
                        of Canadian French life and his peculiar cast of mind and character colored
                        his impression of her. He measured her by the women with whom the <hi
                            rend="i">coureurs de bois</hi> and half-breed trappers consorted in
                        Detroit and at the posts eastward to Quebec.</p>
                    <p>Alice, unable to sleep, had sought forgetfulness of her bitter captivity in
                        the old poet&apos;s charming lyrics. She sat on the floor, some blankets
                        and furs drawn around her, the book on her lap, the stupidly dull lamp
                        hanging beside her on a part of the swivel. Her hair lay loose over her neck
                        and shoulders and shimmered around her face with a cloud-like effect, giving
                        to the features in their repose a setting that intensified their sweetness
                        and sadness. In a very low but distinct voice she was reading, with a
                        slightly quavering intonation: <pb id="VAA2387-308" n="296"/>
                        <q direct="unspecified">
                            <lg>
                                <l n="1">&quot;Mignonne, allons voir si la rose,</l>
                                <l n="2">Que ce matin avoit desclose</l>
                                <l n="3">Sa robe de pourpe au soleil,&quot;</l>
                            </lg>
                        </q> when Hamilton, after stealthily mounting the rough stairway which led
                        to her door, peeped in through a space between the slabs and felt a stroke
                        of disappointment, seeing at a glance that Farnsworth was not there. He
                        gazed for some time, not without a sense of villainy, while she continued
                        her sweetly monotonous reading. If his heart had been as hard as the iron
                        swivel-balls that lay beside Alice, he must still have felt a thrill of
                        something like tender sympathy. She now showed no trace of the vivacious
                        sauciness which had heretofore always marked her features when she was in
                        his presence. A dainty gentleness, touched with melancholy, gave to her face
                        an appealing look all the more powerful on account of its unconscious
                        simplicity of expression.</p>
                    <p>The man felt an impulse pure and noble, which would have borne him back down
                        the ladder and away from the building, had not a stronger one set boldly in
                        the opposite direction. There was a short struggle with the seared remnant
                        of his better nature, and then he tried to open the door; but it was locked.</p>
                    <p>Alice heard the slight noise and breaking off her reading turned to look.
                        Hamilton made another effort to enter before he recollected that the wooden
                        key, or notched lever, that controlled the cumbrous wooden lock, hung on a
                        peg beside the door. He felt for it along the wall, and soon laid his hand
                        on it. Then again he peeped through to see Alice, who was now <pb
                            id="VAA2387-309" n="297"/> standing upright near the swivel. She had
                        thrown her hair back from her face and neck; the lamp&apos;s flickering
                        light seemed suddenly to have magnified her stature and enhanced her beauty.
                        Her book lay on the tumbled wraps at her feet, and in either hand she
                        grasped a swivel-shot.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton&apos;s combative disposition came to the aid of his baser
                        passion when he saw once more a defiant flash from his prisoner&apos;s
                        face. It was easy for him to be fascinated by opposition. Helm
                        <unclear>-ad</unclear> profited by this trait as much as others had suffered
                        by it; but, in the case of Alice, Hamilton&apos;s mingled resentment and
                        admiration were but a powerful irritant to the coarsest and most dangerous
                        side of his nature.</p>
                    <p>After some fumbling and delay he fitted the key with a steady hand and moved
                        the wooden bolt creaking and jolting from its slot. Then flinging the clumsy
                        door wide open, he stepped in.</p>
                    <p>Alice started when she recognized the midnight intruder, and a second deeper
                        look into his countenance made her brave heart recoil, while with a sinking
                        sensation her breath almost stopped. It was but a momentary weakness,
                        however, followed by vigorous reaction.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you here for, sir?&quot; she demanded. &quot;What
                        do you want?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am neither a burglar nor a murderer, Mademoiselle,&quot; he
                        responded, lifting his hat and bowing, with a smile not in the least
                        reassuring.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You look like both. Stop where you are!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-310" n="298"/>
                    <p>&quot;Not so loud, my dear Miss Roussillon; I am not deaf. And besides
                        the garrison needs to sleep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stop, sir; not another step.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She poised herself, leaning slightly backward, and held the iron ball in her
                        right hand ready to throw it at him.</p>
                    <p>He halted, still smiling villainously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mademoiselle, I assure you that your excitement is quite
                        unnecessary. I am not here to harm you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You cannot harm me, you cowardly wretch!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Humph! Pride goes before a fall, wench,&quot; he retorted,
                        taking a half-step backward. Then a thought arose in his mind which added a
                        new shade to the repellent darkness of his countenance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Roussillon,&quot; he said in English and with a changed
                        voice, which seemed to grow harder, each word deliberately emphasized,
                        &quot;I have come to break some bad news to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You would scarcely bring me good news, sir, and I am not
                            <unclear>cu-ous</unclear> to hear the bad.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was <unclear>s-ent</unclear> for a little while, gazing at her with the
                        sort of admiration from which a true woman draws away appalled. He saw how
                        she loathed him, saw how impossible it was for him to get a line nearer to
                        her by any turn of force or fortune. Brave, high-headed, strong as a young
                        leopard, pure and sweet as a rose, she stood before him fearless, even
                        aggressive, showing him by every line of her face and form that she felt her
                        infinite superiority and meant to maintain it. Her whole personal expression
                        told him he was defeated; therefore he quickly seized upon a suggestion <pb
                            id="VAA2387-311" n="299"/> caught from a transaction with Long-Hair, who
                        had returned a few hours before from his pursuit of Beverley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It pains me, I assure you, Miss Roussillon, to tell you what will
                        probably grieve you deeply,&quot; he presently added; &quot;but I
                        have not been unaware of your tender interest in Lieutenant Beverley, and
                        when I had bad news from him, I thought it my duty to inform you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He paused, feeling with a devil&apos;s satisfaction the point of his
                        statement go home to the girl&apos;s heart.</p>
                    <p>The wind was beginning to blow outside, shaking open the dark clouds and
                        letting gleams of moonlight flicker on the thinning fog. A ghostly ray came
                        through a crack between the logs and lit Alice&apos;s face with a
                        pathetic wanness. She moved her lips as if speaking, but Hamilton heard no
                        sound.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Indian, Long-Hair, whom I sent upon Lieutenant
                        Beverley&apos;s trail, reported to me this afternoon that his pursuit
                        had been quite successful. He caught his game.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice&apos;s voice came to her now. She drew in a quivering breath of
                        relief.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then he is herehe isyou have him a prisoner again?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A part of him, Miss Roussillon. Enough to be quite sure that there
                        is one traitor who will trouble his king no more. Mr. Long-Hair brought in
                        the Lieutenant&apos;s scalp.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice received this horrible statement in silence; but her face blanched and
                        she stood as if frozen by the <pb id="VAA2387-312" n="300"/> shock. The
                        shifty moon-glimmer and the yellow glow of the lamp showed Hamilton to what
                        an extent his devilish cruelty hurt her, and somehow it chilled him as if by
                        reflection; but he could not forego another thrust.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He deserved hanging, and would have got it had he been brought to
                        me alive. So after all, you should be satisfied. He escaped my vengeance and
                        Long-Hair got his pay. You see I am the chief sufferer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>These words, however, fell without effect upon the girl&apos;s ears, in
                        which was booming the awful, storm-like roar of her excitement. She did not
                        see her persecutor standing there; her vision, unhindered by walls and
                        distance, went straight away to a place in the wilderness, where all mangled
                        and disfigured Beverley lay dead. A low cry broke from her lips; she dropped
                        the heavy swivel-balls; and then, like a bird, swiftly, with a rustling
                        swoop, she went past Hamilton and down the stair.</p>
                    <p>For perhaps a full minute the man stood there motionless, stupefied, amazed;
                        and when at length he recovered himself, it was with difficulty that he
                        followed her. Everything seemed to hinder him. When he reached the open air,
                        however, he quickly regained his activity of both mind and body, and looked
                        in all directions. The clouds were breaking into parallel masses with
                        streaks of sky between. The moon hanging aslant against the blue peeped
                        forth just in time to show him a flying figure which, even while he looked,
                        reached the postern, opened it and slipped through.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-313" n="301"/>
                    <p>With but a breath of hesitation between giving the alarm and following Alice
                        silently and alone, he chose the latter. He was a swift runner and light
                        footed. With a few bounds he reached the little gate, which was still
                        oscillating on its hinges, darted through and away, straining every muscle
                        in desperate pursuit, gaining rapidly in the race, which bore eastward along
                        the course twice before chosen by Alice in leaving the stockade.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">A MARCH THROUGH COLD WATER</head>
                    <p>On the fifth day of February, 1779, Colonel George Rogers Clark led an army
                        across the Kaskaskia River and camped. This was the first step in his march
                        towards the Wabash. An army! Do not smile. Fewer than two hundred men, it is
                        true, answered the roll-call, when Father Gibault lifted the Cross and
                        blessed them; but every name told off by the company sergeants belonged to a
                        hero, and every voice making response struck a full note in the chorus of
                        freedom&apos;s morning song.</p>
                    <p>It was an army, small indeed, but yet an army; even though so rudely equipped
                        that, could we now see it before us, we might wonder of what use it could
                        possibly be in a military way.</p>
                    <p>We should nevertheless hardly expect that a hundred and seventy of our best
                        men, even if furnished with the latest and most deadly engines of
                        destruction, could do what those pioneers cheerfully undertook and
                        gloriously accomplished in the savage wilderness which was to be the great
                        central area of the United States of America.</p>
                    <p>We look back with a shiver of awe at the three hundred Spartans for whom
                        Simonides composed his matchless epitaph. They wrought and died gloriously;
                        that was Greek. The one hundred and seventy men, <pb id="VAA2387-315"
                            n="303"/> who, led by the backwoodsman, Clark, made conquest of an
                        empire&apos;s area for freedom in the west, wrought and lived
                        gloriously; that was American. It is well to bear in mind this distinction
                        by which our civilization separates itself from that of old times. Our
                        heroism has always been of lifeour heroes have conquered and lived to see
                        the effect of conquest. We have fought all sorts of wars and have never yet
                        felt defeat. Washington, Jackson, Taylor, Grant, all lived to enjoy, after
                        successful war, a triumphant peace. &quot;These Americans,&quot;
                        said a witty Frenchman, &quot;are either enormously lucky, or possessed
                        of miraculous vitality. You rarely kill them in battle, and if you wound
                        them their wounds are never mortal. Their history is but a chain of
                        impossibilities easily accomplished. Their undertakings have been without
                        preparation, their successes in the nature of stupendous
                        accidents.&quot; Such a statement may appear critically sound from a
                        Gallic point of view; but it leaves out the dominant element of American
                        character, namely, heroic efficiency. From the first we have had the courage
                        to undertake, the practical common sense which overcomes the lack of
                        technical training, and the vital force which never flags under the stress
                        of adversity.</p>
                    <p>Clark knew, when he set out on his march to Vincennes, that he was not
                        indulging a visionary impulse. The enterprise was one that called for all
                        that manhood could endure, but not more. With the genius of a born leader he
                        measured his task by his means. He knew his own courage and fortitude, and
                        understood the best capacity of his men. He had genius; that is, <pb
                            id="VAA2387-316" n="304"/> he possessed the secret of extracting from
                        himself and from his followers the last refinement of devotion to purpose.
                        There was a certainty, from first to last, that effort would not flag at any
                        point short of the topmost possible strain.</p>
                    <p>The great star of America was no more than a nebulous splendor on the horizon
                        in 1779. It was a new world forming by the law of youth. The men who bore
                        the burdens of its exacting life were mostly stalwart striplings who, before
                        the down of adolescence fairly sprouted on their chins, could swing the ax,
                        drive a plow, close with a bear or kill an Indian. Clark was not yet
                        twenty-seven when he made his famous campaign. A tall, brawny youth, whose
                        frontier experience had enriched a native character of the best quality, he
                        marched on foot at the head of his little column, and was first to test
                        every opposing danger. Was there a stream to wade or swim? Clark
                        enthusiastically shouted, &quot;Come on!&quot; and in he plunged.
                        Was there a lack of food? &quot;I&apos;m not hungry,&quot; he
                        cried. &quot;Help yourselves, men!&quot; Had some poor soldier lost
                        his blanket? &quot;Mine is in my way,&quot; said Clark.
                        &quot;Take it, I&apos;m glad to get rid of it!&quot; His men
                        loved him, and would die rather than fall short of his expectations.</p>
                    <p>The march before them lay over a magnificent plain, mostly prairie, rich as
                        the delta of the Nile, but extremely difficult to traverse. The distance, as
                        the route led, was about a hundred and seventy miles. On account of an open
                        and rainy winter all the basins and flat lands were inundated, often
                        presenting leagues of <pb id="VAA2387-317" n="305"/> water ranging in depth
                        from a few inches to three or four feet. Cold winds blew, sometimes with
                        spits of snow and dashes of sleet, while thin ice formed on the ponds and
                        sluggish streams. By day progress meant wading ankle-deep, knee-deep,
                        breast-deep, with an occasional spurt of swimming. By night the brav fellows
                        had to sleep, if sleep they could, on the cold ground in soaked clothing
                        under water-heavy blankets. They flung the leagues behind them, however,
                        cheerfully stimulating one another by joke and challenge, defying all the
                        bitterness of weather, all the bitings of hunger, all the toil, danger and
                        deprivation of a trackless and houseless wilderness, looking only eastward,
                        following their youthful and intrepid commander to one of the most valuable
                        victories gained by American soldiers during the War of the Revolution.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Clark understood perfectly the strategic importance of Vincennes as a
                        post commanding the Wabash, and as a base of communication with the many
                        Indian tribes north of the Ohio and east of the Mississippi. Francis Vigo
                        (may his name never fade!) had brought him a comprehensive and accurate
                        report of Hamilton&apos;s strength and the condition of the fort and
                        garrison. This information confirmed his belief that it would be possible
                        not only to capture Vincennes, but Detroit as well.</p>
                    <p>Just seven days after the march began, the little army encamped for a
                        night&apos;s rest at the edge of a wood; and here, just after nightfall,
                        when the fires were burning merrily and the smell of broiling buffalo steaks
                        burdened the damp air, a wizzened old man suddenly <pb id="VAA2387-318"
                            n="306"/> appeared, how or from where nobody had observed. He was dirty
                        and in every way disreputable in appearance, looking like an animated mummy,
                        bearing a long rifle on his shoulder, and walking with the somewhat halting
                        activity of a very old, yet vivacious and energetic simian. Of course it was
                        Oncle Jazon, &quot;Oncle Jazon <hi rend="i">sui generis</hi>,&quot;
                        as Father Beret had dubbed him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, here I am!&quot; he cried, approaching the fire by which
                        Colonel Clark and some of his officers were cooking supper, &quot;but ye
                        can&apos;t guess in a mile o&apos; who I am to save yer livers and
                        lights.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He danced a few stiff steps, which made the water gush out of his tattered
                        moccasins, then doffed his nondescript cap and nodded his scalpless head in
                        salutation to the commander.</p>
                    <p>Clark looked inquiringly at him, while the old fellow grimaced and rubbed his
                        shrunken chin.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I smelt yer fat a fryin&apos; somepin like a mile away,
                        an&apos; it set my in&apos;ards to grumblin&apos; for a snack;
                        so I jes&apos; thought I&apos;d drap in on ye an&apos; chaw
                        wittles wi&apos; ye.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your looks are decidedly against you,&quot; remarked the
                        Colonel with a dry smile. He had recognized Oncle Jazon after a little sharp
                        scrutiny. &quot;I suppose, however, that we can let you gnaw the bones
                        after we&apos;ve got off the meat.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank &apos;ee, thank &apos;ee, plenty good. A feller
                        &apos;at&apos;s as hongry as I am kin go through a bone like a feesh
                        through water.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Clark laughed and said:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-319" n="307"/>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see any teeth that you have worth mentioning, but
                        your gums may be unusually sharp.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ya-a-s, &apos;bout as sharp as yer wit, Colonel Clark,
                        an&apos; sharper&apos;n yer eyes, a long shot. Ye don&apos;t
                        know me, do ye? Take ernother squint at me, an&apos; see&apos;f ye
                        kin &apos;member a good lookin&apos; man!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have somewhat the appearance of an old scamp by the name of
                        Jazon that formerly loafed around with a worthless gun on his shoulder, and
                        used to run from every Indian he saw down yonder in Kentucky.&quot;
                        Clark held out his hand and added cordially:</p>
                    <p>&quot;How are you, Jazon, my old friend, and where upon earth have you
                        come from?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon pounced upon the hand and gripped it in his own knotted fingers,
                        gazing delightedly up into Clark&apos;s bronzed and laughing face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where&apos;d I come frum? I come frum ever&apos;wheres.
                        Fust time I ever got lost in all my born days. I&apos;ve been a
                        trompin&apos; &apos;round in the water seems like a week, crazy as a
                        pizened rat, not a knowin&apos; north f&apos;om south, ner my big
                        toe f&apos;om a turnip! Who&apos;s got some to-backer?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon&apos;s story, when presently he told it, interrested Clark
                        deeply. In the first place he was glad to hear that Simon Kenton had once
                        more escaped from the Indians; and the news from Beverley, although bad
                        enough, left room for hope. Frontiersmen always regarded the chances better
                        than even, so long as there was life. Oncle Jazon, furthermore, had much to
                        tell about the situation at Vincennes, the true feeling of the French
                        inhabitants, the lukewarm <pb id="VAA2387-320" n="308"/> friendship of the
                        larger part of the Indians for Hamilton, and, indeed, everything that Clark
                        wished to know regarding the possibilities of success in his arduous
                        undertaking. The old man&apos;s advent cheered the whole camp. He soon
                        found acquaintances and friends among the French volunteers from Kaskaskia,
                        with whom he exchanged creole gestures and chatter with a vivacity
                        apparently inexhaustible. He and Kenton had, with wise judgement, separated
                        on escaping from the Indian camp, Kenton striking out for Kentucky, while
                        Oncle Jazon went towards Kaskaskia.</p>
                    <p>The information that Beverley would be shot as soon as he was returned to
                        Hamilton, caused Colonel Clark serious worry of mind. Not only the fact that
                        Beverley, who had been a charming friend and a most gallant officer, was now
                        in such imminent danger, but the impression (given by Oncle Jazon&apos;s
                        account) that he had broken his parole, was deeply painful to the brave and
                        scrupulously honorable commander. Still, friendship rose above regret, and
                        Clark resolved to push his little column forward all the more rapidly,
                        hoping to arrive in time to prevent the impending execution.</p>
                    <p>Next morning the march was resumed at the break of dawn; but a swollen stream
                        caused some hours of delay, during which Beverley himself arrived from the
                        rear, a haggard and weirdly unkempt apparition. He had been for three days
                        following hard on the army&apos;s track, which he came to far westward.
                        Oncle Jazon saw him first in the distance, and his old but educated eyes
                        made no mistake.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-321" n="309"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yander&apos;s that youngster Beverley,&quot; he exclaimed.
                        &quot;Ef it ain&apos;t I&apos;m a squaw!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Nor did he parley further on the subject; but set off at a rickety trot to
                        meet and assist the fagged and excited young man.</p>
                    <p>Clark had given Oncle Jazon his flask, which contained a few gills of whisky.
                        This was the first thing offered to Beverley, who wisely took but a swallow.
                        Oncle Jazon was so elated that he waved his cap on high, and unconsciously
                        falling into French, yelled in a piercing voice:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Vive Zhorsh Vasinton! Vive la bannire
                            d&apos;Alice Roussillon!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>Seeing Beverley reminded him of Alice and the flag. As for Beverley, the
                        sentiment braced him, and the beloved name brimmed his heart with sweetness.</p>
                    <p>Clark went to meet them as they came in. He hugged the gaunt Lieutenant with
                        genuine fervor of joy, while Oncle Jazon ran around them making a series of
                        grotesque capers. The whole command, hearing Oncle Jazon&apos;s
                        patriotic words, set up a wild shouting on the spur of a general impression
                        that Beverley came as a messenger bearing glorious news from
                        Washington&apos;s army in the east.</p>
                    <p>It was a great relief to Clark when he found out that his favorite Lieutenant
                        had not broken his parole; but had instead boldly resurrendered himself,
                        declaring the obligation no longer binding, and notifying Hamilton of his
                        intention to go away with the purpose of returning and destroying him and
                        his command. Clark laughed heartily when this explanation brought out <pb
                            id="VAA2387-322" n="310"/> Beverley&apos;s tender interest in Alice;
                        but he sympathized cordially; for he himself knew what love is.</p>
                    <p>Although Beverley was half starved and still suffering from the kicks and
                        blows given him by Long-Hair and his warriors, his exhausting run on the
                        trail of Clark and his band had not worked him serious harm. All of the
                        officers and men did their utmost to serve him. He was feasted without stint
                        and furnished with everything that the scant supply of clothing on the pack
                        horses could afford for his comfort. He promptly asked for an assignment to
                        duty in his company and took his place with such high enthusiasm that his
                        companions regarded him with admiring wonder. None of them save Clark and
                        Oncle Jazon suspected that love for a fair-haired girl yonder in Vincennes
                        was the secret of his amazing zeal and intrepidity.</p>
                    <p>In one respect Clark&apos;s expedition was sadly lacking in its equipment
                        for the march. It had absolutely no means of transporting adequate supplies.
                        The pack-horses were not able to carry more than a little extra ammunition,
                        a few articles of clothing, some simple cooking utensils and such tools as
                        were needed in improvising rafts and canoes. Consequently, although buffalo
                        and deer were sometimes plentiful, they furnished no lasting supply of meat,
                        because it could not be transported; and as the army neared Vincennes wild
                        animals became scarce, so that the men began to suffer from hunger when
                        within but a few days of their journey&apos;s end.</p>
                    <p>Clark made almost superhuman efforts in urging forward his chilled,
                        water-soaked, foot-sore command; <pb id="VAA2387-323" n="311"/> and when
                        hunger added its torture to the already disheartening conditions, his
                        courage and energy seemed to burn stronger and brighter. Beverley was always
                        at his side ready to undertake any task, accept any risk; his ardor made his
                        face glow, and he seemed to thrive upon hardships. The two men were a source
                        of inspirationtheir followers could not flag and hesitate while under the
                        influence of their example.</p>
                    <p>Toward the end of the long march a decided fall of temperature added ice to
                        the water through which our dauntless patriots waded and swam for miles. The
                        wind shifted northwesterly, taking on a searching chill. Each gust, indeed,
                        seemed to shoot wintry splinters into the very marrow of the men&apos;s
                        bones. The weaker ones began to show the approach of utter exhaustion just
                        at the time when a final spurt of unflinching power was needed. True, they
                        struggled heroically; but nature was nearing the inexorable limit of
                        endurance. Without food, which there was no prospect of getting, collapse
                        was sure to come.</p>
                    <p>Standing nearly waist-deep in freezing water and looking out upon the muddy,
                        sea-like flood that stretched far away to the channel of the Wabash and
                        beyond, Clark turned to Beverley and said, speaking low, so as not to be
                        overheard by any other of his officers or men:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it possible, Lieutenant Beverley, that we are to fail, with
                        Vincennes almost in sight of us?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, sir, it is not possible,&quot; was the firm reply.
                        &quot;Nothing must, nothing can stop us. Look at that brave child! He
                        sets the heroic example.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-324" n="312"/>
                    <p>Beverley pointed, as he spoke, at a boy but fourteen years old, who was using
                        his drum as a float to bear him up while he courageously swam beside the
                        men.</p>
                    <p>Clark&apos;s clouded face cleared once more. &quot;You are
                        right,&quot; he said, &quot;come on! we must win or die.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sergeant Dewit,&quot; he added, turning to an enormously tall
                        and athletic man near by, &quot;take that little drummer and his drum on
                        your shoulder and lead the way. And, sergeant, make him pound that drum like
                        the devil beating tan-bark!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The huge man caught the spirit of his commander&apos;s order. In a
                        twinkling he had the boy astride of his neck with the kettle-drum resting on
                        his head, and then the rattling music began. Clark followed, pointing onward
                        with his sword. The half frozen and tottering soldiers sent up a shout that
                        went back to where Captain Bowman was bringing up the rear under orders to
                        shoot every man that straggled or shrank from duty.</p>
                    <p>Now came a time when not a mouthful of food was left. A whole day they
                        floundered on, starving, growing fainter at every step, the temperature
                        falling, the ice thickening. They camped on high land; and next morning they
                        heard Hamilton&apos;s distant sunrise gun boom over the water.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One half-ration for the men,&quot; said Clark, looking
                        disconsolately in the direction whence the sound had come. &quot;Just
                        five mouthfuls apiece, even, and I&apos;ll have Hamilton and his fort
                        within forty-eight hours.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We will have the provisions, Colonel, or I will die <pb
                            id="VAA2387-325" n="313"/> trying to get them,&quot; Beverley
                        responded. &quot;Depend upon me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They had constructed some canoes in which to transport the weakest of the
                        men.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will take a dugout and some picked fellows. We will pull to the
                        wood yonder, and there we shall find some kind of game which has been forced
                        to shelter from the high water.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was a cheerful view of a forlorn hope. Clark grasped the hand extended by
                        Beverley and they looked encouragement into each other&apos;s eyes.</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon volunteered to go in the pirogue. He was ready for anything,
                        everything.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t shoot wo&apos;th a cent,&quot; he whined,
                        as they took their places in the cranky pirogue; &quot;but I might
                        jes&apos; happen to kill a squir&apos;l or a elephant or somepin
                        &apos;nother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; shouted Clark in a loud, cheerful voice, when
                        they had paddled away to a considerable distance, &quot;bring the meat
                        to the woods on the hill yonder,&quot; pointing to a distant island-like
                        ridge far beyond the creeping flood. &quot;We&apos;ll be there ready
                        to eat it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He said this for the ears of his men. They heard and answered with a
                        straggling but determined chorus of approval. They crossed the rolling
                        current of the Wabash by a tedious process of ferrying, and at last found
                        themselves once more wading in back-water up to their armpits, breaking ice
                        an inch thick as they went. It was the closing struggle to reach the high
                        wooded lands. Many of them fell exhausted; but their <pb id="VAA2387-326"
                            n="314"/> stronger comrades lifted them, holding their heads above
                        water, and dragged them on.</p>
                    <p>Clark, always leading, always inspiring, was first to set foot on dry land.
                        He shouted triumphantly, waved his sword, and then fell to helping the men
                        out of the freezing flood. This accomplished, he ordered fires built; but
                        there was not a soldier of them all whose hands could clasp an ax-handle, so
                        weak and numbed with cold were they. He was not to be baffled, however. If
                        fire could not be had, exercise must serve its purpose. Hastily pouring some
                        powder into his hand he dampened it and blacked his face. &quot;Victory,
                        men, victory!&quot; he shouted, taking off his hat and beginning to leap
                        and dance. &quot;Come on! We&apos;ll have a war dance and then a
                        feast, as soon as the meat arrives that I have sent for. Dance! you brave
                        lads, dance! Victory! victory!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The strong men, understanding their Colonel&apos;s purpose, took hold of
                        the delicate ones; and the leaping, the capering, the tumult of voices and
                        the stamping of slushy moccasins with which they assaulted that stately
                        forest must have frightened every wild thing thereabout into a deadly rigor.
                        Clark&apos;s irrepressible energy and optimism worked a veritable charm
                        upon his faithful but almost dying companions in arms. Their trust in him
                        made them feel sure that food would soon be forthcoming. The thought
                        afforded a stimulus more potent than wine; it drove them into an ecstasy of
                        frantic motion and shouting which soon warmed them thoroughly.</p>
                    <p>It is said that fortune favors the brave. The larger <pb id="VAA2387-327"
                            n="315"/> meaning of the sentence may be given thus: God guards those
                        who deserve His protection. History tells us that just when Clark halted his
                        command almost in sight of Vincennesjust when hunger was about to prevent
                        the victory so close to his graspa party of his scouts brought in the haunch
                        of a buffalo captured from some Indians. The scouts were Lieutenant Beverley
                        and Oncle Jazon. And with the meat they brought Indian kettles in which to
                        cook it.</p>
                    <p>With consummate forethought Clark arranged to prevent his men doing
                        themselves injury by bolting their food or eating it half-cooked. Broth was
                        first made and served hot; then small bits of well broiled steak were doled
                        out, until by degrees the fine effect of nourishment set in, and all the
                        command felt the fresh courage of healthy reaction.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I ain&apos;t no gin&apos;ral, nor corp&apos;ral, nor
                        nothin&apos;,&quot; remarked Oncle Jazon to Colonel Clark,
                        &quot;but &apos;f I&apos;s you I&apos;d h&apos;ist up
                        every dad dinged ole flag in the rig&apos;ment, w&apos;en I got
                        ready to show myself to &apos;em, an&apos; I&apos;d make
                        &apos;em think, over yander at the fort, &apos;at I had
                        &apos;bout ninety thousan&apos; men. Hit &apos;d skeer that
                        sandy faced Gov&apos;nor over there till he&apos;d think his
                        back-bone was a comin&apos; out&apos;n &apos;im by the
                        roots.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Clark laughed, but his face showed that the old man&apos;s suggestion
                        struck him forcibly and seriously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll see about that presently, Oncle Jazon. Wait till we
                        reach the hill yonder, from which the whole town can observe our manoeuvres,
                        then we&apos;ll try it, maybe.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-328" n="316"/>
                    <p>Once more the men were lined up, the roll-call gone through with
                        satisfactorily, and the question put:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are we ready for another plunge through the mud and
                        water?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The answer came in the affirmative, with a unanimity not to be mistaken. The
                        weakest heart of them all beat to the time of the charge step. Again Clark
                        and Beverley clasped hands and took the lead.</p>
                    <p>When they reached the next high ground they gazed in silence across a slushy
                        prairie plot to where, on a slight elevation, old Vincennes and Fort
                        Sackville lay in full view.</p>
                    <p>Beverley stood apart. A rush of sensations affected him so that he shook like
                        one whose strength is gone. His vision was blurred. Fort and town swimming
                        in a mist were silent and still. Save the British flag twinkling above
                        Hamilton&apos;s headquarters, nothing indicated that the place was not
                        deserted. And Alice? With the sweet name&apos;s echo Beverley&apos;s
                        heart bounded high, then sank fluttering at the recollection that she was
                        either yonder at the mercy of Hamilton, or already the victim of an
                        unspeakable cruelty. Was it weakness for him to lift his clasped hands
                        heavenward and send up a voiceless prayer?</p>
                    <p>While he stood thus Oncle Jazon came softly to his side and touched his arm.
                        Beverley started.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The nex&apos; thing&apos;ll be to shoot the
                        everlastin&apos; gizzards outen &apos;em, won&apos;t
                        it?&quot; the old man inquired. &quot;I&apos;m jes&apos; a
                        eetchin&apos; to git a grip onto that Gov&apos;nor. Ef I
                        don&apos;t scelp &apos;em I&apos;m a squaw.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley drew a deep breath and came promptly <pb id="VAA2387-329" n="317"/>
                        back from his dream. It was now Oncle Jazon&apos;s turn to assume a
                        reflective, reminiscent mood. He looked about him with an expression of
                        vague half tenderness on his shriveled features.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;s jes&apos; a thinkin&apos; how time do run past
                        a feller,&quot; he presently remarked. &quot;Twenty-seven years ago
                        I camped right here wi&apos; my wifeninth one, ef I &apos;member
                        correctjes&apos; fresh married to &apos;r; sort o&apos;
                        honeymoon. &apos;Twus warm an&apos; sunshiny an&apos; nice. She
                        wus a poorty squaw, mighty poorty, an&apos; I wus as happy as a tomtit
                        on a sugar-trough. We b&apos;iled sap yander on them nobs under the
                        maples. It wus glor&apos;us. Had some several wives &apos;fore
                        an&apos; lots of &apos;m sence; but she wus sweetes&apos; of
                        &apos;m all. Strange how a feller &apos;members sich things
                        an&apos; feels sort o&apos; lonesome like!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man&apos;s mouth drooped at the corners and he hitched up his
                        buckskin trousers with a ludicrous suggestion of pathos in every line of his
                        attitude. Unconsciously he sidled closer to Beverley, remotely feeling that
                        he was giving the young man very effective sympathy, well knowing that Alice
                        was the sweet burden of his thoughts. It was thus Oncle Jazon honestly tried
                        to fortify his friend against what probably lay in store for him.</p>
                    <p>But Beverley failed to catch the old man&apos;s crude comfort thus flung
                        at him. The analogy was not apparent. Oncle Jazon probably felt that his
                        kindness had been ineffectual, for he changed his tone and added:</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I s&apos;pose a young feller like ye can&apos;t
                        onder-stan&apos; w&apos;at it is to love a &apos;oman
                        an&apos; &apos;en hev &apos;er quit ye <pb id="VAA2387-330"
                            n="318"/> for &apos;nother feller, an&apos; him a buck Injin.
                        Wall, wall, wall, that&apos;s the way it do go! Of all the
                        livin&apos; things upon top o&apos; this yere globe, the
                        mos&apos; onsartin&apos;, crinkety-crankety an&apos; slippery
                        thing is a young &apos;oman &apos;at knows she&apos;s poorty
                        an&apos; &apos;at every other man in the known world is blind
                        stavin&apos; crazy in love wi&apos; &apos;er, same as you are.
                        She&apos;ll drop ye like a hot tater &apos;fore ye know it,
                        an&apos; &apos;en look at ye jes&apos; pine blank like she never
                        knowed ye afore in her life. It&apos;s so, Lieutenant, shore&apos;s
                        ye&apos;r born. I know, for I&apos;ve tried the odd number of
                        &apos;em, an&apos; they&apos;re all jes&apos; the
                        same.&quot;</p>
                    <p>By this time Beverley&apos;s ears were deaf to Oncle Jazon&apos;s
                        querulous, whining voice, and his thoughts once more followed his wistful
                        gaze across the watery plain to where the low roofs of the creole town
                        appeared dimly wavering in the twilight of eventide, which was fast fading
                        into night. The scene seemed unsubstantial; he felt a strange lethargy
                        possessing his soul; he could not realize the situation. In trying to
                        imagine Alice, she eluded him, so that a sort of cloudy void fell across his
                        vision with the effect of baffling and benumbing it. He made vain efforts to
                        recall her voice, things that she had said to him, her face, her smiles; all
                        he could do was to evoke an elusive, tantalizing, ghostly something which
                        made him shiver inwardly with a haunting fear that it meant the worst,
                        whatever the worst might be. Where was she? Could she be dead, and this the
                        shadowy message of her fate?</p>
                    <p>Darkness fell, and a thin fog began to drift in wan streaks above the water.
                        Not a sound, save the suppressed stir of the camp, broke the wide, dreary
                            <pb id="VAA2387-331" n="319"/> silence. Oncle Jazon babbled until
                        satisfied that Beverley was unappreciative, or at least unresponsive.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Got to hev some terbacker,&quot; he remarked, and shambled away
                        in search of it among his friends.</p>
                    <p>A little later Clark approached hastily and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have been looking for you. The march has begun. Bowman and
                        Charleville are moving; come, there&apos;s no time to
                    lose.&quot;</p>
                </div2>
                <pb id="VAA2387-332" n="320"/>
                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head type="main">CHAPTER XVIII</head>
                    <head type="subtitle">A DUEL BY MOONLIGHT</head>
                    <p>When Hamilton, after running some distance, saw that he was gaining upon
                        Alice and would soon overtake her, it added fresh energy to his limbs. He
                        had quickly realized the foolishness of what he had done in visiting the
                        room of his prisoner at so late an hour in the night. What would his
                        officers and men think? To let Alice escape would be extremely embarrassing,
                        and to be seen chasing her would give good ground for ridicule on the part
                        of his entire command. Therefore his first thought, after passing through
                        the postern and realizing fully what sort of predicament threatened him, was
                        to recapture her and return her to the prison room in the block-house
                        without attracting attention. This now promised to be an easier task than he
                        had at first feared; for in the moonlight, which on account of the
                        dispersing clouds, was fast growing stronger, he saw her seem to falter and
                        weaken. Certainly her flight was checked and took an eccentric turn, as if
                        some obstruction had barred her way. He rushed on, not seeing that, as Alice
                        swerved, a man intervened. Indeed he was within a few strides of laying his
                        hand on her when he saw her make the strange movement. It was as if,
                        springing suddenly aside, she had become two persons instead of one. But
                        instantly the figures coincided again, and in becoming taller faced about
                        and confronted him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-333" n="321"/>
                    <p>Hamilton stopped short in his tracks. The dark figure was about five paces
                        from him. It was not Alice, and a sword flashed dimly but unmistakably in a
                        ray of the moon. The motion visible was that of an expert swordsman placing
                        himself firmly on his legs, with his weapon at guard.</p>
                    <p>Alice saw the man in her path just in time to avoid running against him.
                        Lightly as a flying bird, when it whisks itself in a short semicircle past a
                        tree or a bough, she sprang aside and swung around to the rear of him, where
                        she could continue her course toward the town. But in passing she recognized
                        him. It was Father Beret, and how grim he looked! The discovery was made in
                        the twinkling of an eye, and its effect was instantaneous, not only checking
                        the force of her flight, but stopping her and turning her about to gaze
                        before she had gone five paces farther.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton&apos;s nerve held, startled as he was, when he realized that an
                        armed man stood before him. Naturally he fell into the error of thinking
                        that he had been running after this fellow all the way from the little gate,
                        where, he supposed, Alice had somehow given him the slip. It was a mere
                        flash of brain-light, so to call it, struck out by the surprise of this
                        curious discovery. He felt his bellicose temper leap up furiously at being
                        balked in a way so unexpected and withal so inexplicable. Of course he did
                        not stand there reasoning it all out. The rush of impressions came, and at
                        the same time he acted with promptness. Changing the rapier, which he held
                        in his right hand, over into his left, he drew a small pistol from the
                        breast of his coat <pb id="VAA2387-334" n="322"/> and fired. The report was
                        sharp and loud; but it caused no uneasiness or inquiry in the fort, owing to
                        the fact that Indians invariably emptied their guns when coming into the
                        town.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton&apos;s aim, although hasty, was not bad. The bullet from his
                        weapon cut through Father Beret&apos;s clothes between his left arm and
                        his body, slightly creasing the flesh on a rib. Beyond him it struck heavily
                        and audibly. Alice fell limp and motionless to the soft wet ground, where
                        cold puddles of water were splintered over with ice. She lay pitifully
                        crumpled, one arm outstretched in the moonlight. Father Beret heard the
                        bullet hit her, and turned in time to see her stagger backward with a hand
                        convulsively pressed over her heart. Her face, slightly upturned as she
                        reeled, gave the moon a pallid target for its strengthening rays. Sweet,
                        beautiful, its rigid features flashed for a second and then half turned away
                        from the light and went down.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret uttered a short, thin cry and moved as if to go to the fallen
                        girl, but just then he saw Hamilton&apos;s sword pass over again into
                        his right hand, and knew that there was no time for anything but death or
                        fight. The good priest did not shirk what might have made the readiest of
                        soldiers nervous. Hamilton was known to be a great swordsman and proud of
                        the distinction. Father Beret had seen him fence with Farns-worth in
                        remarkable form, touching him at will, and in ministering to the men in the
                        fort he had heard them talk of the Governor&apos;s incomparable skill.</p>
                    <p>A priest is, in perhaps all cases but the last out of <pb id="VAA2387-335"
                            n="323"/> a thousand, a man of peace, not to be forced into a fight; but
                        the exceptional one out of the ten hundred it is well not to stir up if you
                        are looking for an easy victim. Hamilton was in the habit of considering
                        every antagonist immediately conquerable. His domineering spirit could not,
                        when opposed, reckon with any possibility of disaster. As he sprang toward
                        Father Beret there was a mutual recognition and, we speak guardedly,
                        something that sounded exactly like an exchange of furious execrations. As
                        for Father Beret&apos;s words, they may have been a mere priestly
                        formula of objurgation.</p>
                    <p>The moon was accommodating. With a beautiful white splendor it entered a
                        space of cloudless sky, where it seemed to slip along the dusky blue surface
                        among the stars, far over in the west.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s you, is it?&quot; Hamilton exclaimed between
                        teeth that almost crushed one another. &quot;You prowling hypocrite of
                        hell!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret said something. It was not complimentary, and it sounded
                        sulphurous, if not profane. Remember, however, that a priest can scarcely
                        hope to be better than Peter, and Peter did actually make the Simon pure
                        remark when hard pressed. At all events Father Beret said something with
                        vigorous emphasis, and met Hamilton half way.</p>
                    <p>Both men, stimulated to the finger-tips by a draught of imperious passion,
                        fairly plunged to the inevitable conflict. Ah, if Alice could have seen her
                        beautiful weapons cross, if she could have heard the fine, far-reaching
                        clink, clink, clink, while sparks leaped forth, <pb id="VAA2387-336" n="324"
                        /> dazzling even in the moonlight; if she could have noted the admirable,
                        nay, the amazing, play, as the men, regaining coolness to some extent,
                        gathered their forces and fell cautiously to the deadly work, it would have
                        been enough to change the cold shimmer of her face to a flash of warm
                        delight. For she would have understood every feint, longe, parry, and seen
                        at a glance how Father Beret set the pace and led the race at the beginning.
                        She would have understood; for Father Beret had taught her all she knew
                        about the art of fencing.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton quickly felt, and with a sense of its strangeness, the
                        priest&apos;s masterly command of his weapon. The surprise called up all
                        his caution and cleverness. Before he could adjust himself to such an
                        unexpected condition he came near being spitted outright by a pretty pass
                        under his guard. The narrow escape, while it put him on his best mettle,
                        sent a wave of superstition through his brain. He recalled what Barlow had
                        jocularly said about the doings of the devil-priest or priest-devil at
                        Roussillon place on that night when the patrol guard attempted to take
                        Gaspard Roussillon. Was this, indeed, Father Beret, that gentle old man, now
                        before him, or was it an avenging demon from the shades?</p>
                    <p>The thought flitted electrically across his mind, while he deftly parried,
                        feinted, longed, giving his dark antagonist all he could do to meet the
                        play. Priest or devil, he thought, he cared not which, he would reach its
                        vitals presently. Yet there lingered with him a haunting half-fear, or
                        tenuous awe, which may have <pb id="VAA2387-337" n="325"/> aided, rather
                        than hindered his excellent swordsmanship.</p>
                    <p>Under foot it was slushy with mud, water and ice, the consistency varying
                        from a somewhat solid crust to puddles that half inundated
                        Hamilton&apos;s boots and quite overflowed Father Beret&apos;s
                        moccasins. An execrable field for the little matter in hand. They gradually
                        shifted position. Now it was the Governor, then the priest, who had
                        advantage as to the light. For some time Father Beret seemed quite the
                        shiftier and surer fighter, but (was it his age telling on him?) he lost
                        perceptibly in suppleness. Still Hamilton failed to touch him. There was a
                        baffling something in the old man&apos;s escape now and again from what
                        ought to have been an inevitable stroke. Was it luck? It seemed to Hamilton
                        more than thata sort of uncanny evasion. Or was it supreme mastery, the last
                        and subtlest reach of the fencer&apos;s craft?</p>
                    <p>Youth forced age slowly backward in the struggle, which at times took on
                        spurts so furious that the slender blades, becoming mere glints of acicular
                        steel, split the moonlight back and forth, up and down, so that their
                        meetings, following one another in a well-nigh continuous stroke, sent a
                        jarring noise through the air. Father Beret lost inch by inch, until the
                        fighting was almost over the body of Alice; and now for the first time
                        Hamilton became aware of that motionless something with the white, luminous
                        face in profile against the ground; but he did not let even that unsettle
                        his fencing gaze, which followed the sunken and dusky eyes of his adversary.
                        A perspiration suddenly <pb id="VAA2387-338" n="326"/> flooded his body,
                        however, and began to drip across his face. His arm was tiring. A doubt
                        crept like a chill into his heart. Then the priest appeared to add a cubit
                        to his stature and waver strangely in the soft light. Behind him, low
                        against the sky, a wide winged owl shot noiselessly across just above the
                        prairie.</p>
                    <p>The soul of a true priest is double: it is the soul of a saint and the soul
                        of a worldly man. What is most beautiful in this duality is the supreme
                        courage with which the saintly spirit attacks the worldly and so often
                        heroically masters it. In the beginning of the fight Father Beret let a
                        passion of the earthly body take him by storm. It was well for Governor
                        Henry Hamilton that the priest was so wrought upon as to unsettle his
                        nerves, otherwise there would have been an evil heart impaled midway of
                        Father Beret&apos;s rapier. A little later the saintly spirit began to
                        assert itself, feebly indeed, but surely. Then it was that Father Beret
                        seemed to be losing agility for a while as he backstepped away from
                        Hamilton&apos;s increasing energy of assault. In his heart the priest
                        was saying: &quot;I will not murder him. I must not do that. He deserves
                        death, but vengeance is not mine. I will disarm him.&quot; Step by step
                        he retreated, playing erratically to make an opening for a trick he meant to
                        use.</p>
                    <p>It was singularly loose play, a sort of wavering, shifty, incomprehensible
                        show of carelessness, that caused Hamilton to entertain a doubt, which was
                        really a fear, as to what was going to happen; for, notwithstanding all this
                        neglect of due precaution on the <pb id="VAA2387-339" n="327"/>
                        priest&apos;s part, to touch him seemed impossible, miraculously so, and
                        every plan of attack dissolved into futility in the most maddening way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Priest, devil or ghost!&quot; raged Hamilton, with a froth
                        gathering around his mouth; &quot;I&apos;ll kill you, or&quot;</p>
                    <p>He made a longe, when his adversary left an opening which appeared absolutely
                        beyond defence. It was a quick, dextrous, vicious thrust. The blade leaped
                        toward Father Beret&apos;s heart with a twinkle like lightning.</p>
                    <p>At that moment, although warily alert and hopeful that his opportunity was at
                        hand, Father Beret came near losing his life; for as he side-stepped and
                        easily parried Hamilton&apos;s thrust, which he had invited, thinking to
                        entangle his blade and disarm him, he caught his foot in Alice&apos;s
                        skirt and stumbled, nearly falling across her. It would have been easy for
                        Hamilton to run him through, had he instantly followed up the advantage. But
                        the moonlight on Alice&apos;s face struck his eyes, and by that indirect
                        ray of vision which is often strangely effective, he recognized her lying
                        there. It was a disconcerting thing for him, but he rallied instantly and
                        sprang aside, taking a new position just in time to face Father Beret again.
                        A chill crept up his back. The horror which he could not shake off enraged
                        him beyond measure. Gathering fresh energy, he renewed the assault with
                        desperate steadiness, the highest product of absolutely molten fury.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret felt the dangerous access of power in <pb id="VAA2387-340"
                            n="328"/> his antagonist&apos;s arm, and knew that a crisis had
                        arrived. He could not be careless now. Here was a swordsman of the best
                        school calling upon him for all the skill and strength and cunning that he
                        could command. Again the saintly element was near being thrown aside by the
                        worldly in the old man&apos;s breast. Alice lying there seemed mutely
                        demanding that he avenge her. A riotous something in his blood clamored for
                        a quick and certain act in this drama by moonlighta tragic close by a stroke
                        of terrible yet perfectly fitting justice.</p>
                    <p>There was but the space of a breath for the conflict in the priest&apos;s
                        heart, yet during that little time he reasoned the case and quoted scripture
                        to himself.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Domine, percutimus in gladio?&quot;</hi> rang
                        through his mind. &quot;Lord, shall we smite with the sword?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton seemed to make answer to this with a dazzling display of skill. The
                        rapiers sang a strange song above the sleeping girl, a lullaby with
                        coruscations of death in every keen note.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret was thinking of Alice. His brain, playing double, calculated
                        with lightning swiftness the chances and movements of that whirlwind rush of
                        fight, while at the same time it swept through a retrospect of all the years
                        since Alice came into his life. How he had watched her grow and bloom; how
                        he had taught her, trained her mind and soul and body to high things, loved
                        her with a fatherly passion unbounded, guarded her from the coarse and
                        lawless influences of her surroundings. Like the tolling of an infinitely
                        melancholy bell, all this went through his breast and <pb id="VAA2387-341"
                            n="329"/> brain, and, blending with a furious current of whatever
                        passions were deadly dangerous in his nature, swept as a storm bearing its
                        awful force into his sword-arm.</p>
                    <p>The Englishman was a lion, the priest a gladiator. The stars aloft in the
                        vague, dark, yet splendid, amphitheater were the audience. It was a
                        question. Would the thumbs go down or up? Life and death held the chances
                        even; but it was at the will of Heaven, not of the stars. <hi rend="i"
                            >&quot;Hoc habet&quot;</hi> must follow the stroke ordered from
                        beyond the astral clusters and the dusky blue.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton pressed, nay rushed, the fight with a weight and at a pace which
                        could not last. But Father Beret withstood him so firmly that he made no
                        farther headway; he even lost some ground a moment later.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You damned Jesuit hypocrite!&quot; he snarled; &quot;you
                        lowest of a vile brotherhood of liars!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then he rushed again, making a magnificent show of strength, quickness and
                        accuracy. The sparks hissed and crackled from the rasping and ringing
                        blades.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret was, in truth, a Jesuit, and as such a zealot; but he was not a
                        liar or a hypocrite. Being human, he resented an insult. The saintly spirit
                        in him was strong, yet not strong enough to breast the indignation which now
                        dashed against it. For a moment it went down.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Liar and scoundrel yourself!&quot; he retorted, hoarsely <pb
                            id="VAA2387-342" n="330"/> forcing the words out of his throat.
                        &quot;Spawn of a beastly breed!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton saw and felt a change pass over the spirit of the old
                        priest&apos;s movements. Instantly the sword leaping against his own
                        seemed endowed with subtle cunning and malignant treachery. Before this it
                        had been difficult enough to meet the fine play and hold fairly even; now he
                        was startled and confused; but he rose to the emergency with admirable will
                        power and cleverness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Murderer of a poor orphan girl!&quot; Father Beret added with a
                        hot concentrated accent; &quot;death is too good for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton felt nearer his grave than ever before in all his wild experience,
                        for somehow doom, shadowy and formless, like the atmosphere of an awful
                        dream, enmisted those words; but he was no weakling to quit at the height of
                        desperate conflict. He was strong, expert, and game to the middle of his
                        heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll add a traitor Jesuit to my list of dead,&quot; he
                        panted forth, rising yet again to the extremest tension of his power.</p>
                    <p>As he did this Father Beret settled himself as you have seen a mighty horse
                        do in the home stretch of a race. Both men knew that the moment had arrived
                        for the final act in their impromptu play. It was short, a duel condensed
                        and crowded into fifteen seconds of time, and it was rapid beyond the power
                        of words to describe. A bystander, had there been one, could not have seen
                        what was finally done or how it was done. Father Beret&apos;s sword
                        seemed to be revolvingit was <pb id="VAA2387-343" n="331"/> a halo in front
                        of Hamilton for a mere point of time. The old priest seemed to crouch and
                        then make a quick motion as if about to leap backward. A wrench and a snip,
                        as of something violently jerked from a fastening, were followed by a
                        semicircular flight of Hamilton&apos;s rapier over Father
                        Beret&apos;s head to stick in the ground ten feet behind him. The duel
                        was over, and the whole terrible struggle had occupied less than three
                        minutes.</p>
                    <p>With his wrist strained and his fingers almost broken, Hamilton stumbled
                        forward and would have impaled himself had not Father Beret turned the point
                        of his weapon aside as he lowered it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Surrender, or die!&quot;</p>
                    <p>That was a strange order for a priest to make, but there could be no
                        mistaking its authority or the power behind it. Hamilton regained his
                        footing and looked dazed, wheezing and puffing like a porpoise, but he
                        clearly understood what was demanded of him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you call out I&apos;ll run you through,&quot; Father
                        Beret added, seeing him move his lips as if to shout for help.</p>
                    <p>The level rapier now reinforced the words. Hamilton let the breath go
                        noiselessly from his mouth and waved his hand in token of enforced
                        submission.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what do you want me to do?&quot; he demanded after a
                        short pause. &quot;You seem to have me at your mercy. What are your
                        terms?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret hesitated. It was a question difficult to answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give me your word as a British officer that you <pb
                            id="VAA2387-344" n="332"/> will never again try to harm any person, not
                        an open, armed enemy, in this town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton&apos;s gorge rose perversely. He erected himself with lofty
                        reserve and folded his arms. The dignity of a Lieutenant Governor leaped
                        into him and took control. Father Beret correctly interpreted what he saw.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My people have borne much,&quot; he said, &quot;and the
                        killing of that poor child there will be awfully avenged if I but say the
                        word. Besides, I can turn every Indian in this wilderness against you in a
                        single day. You are indeed at my mercy, and I will be merciful if you will
                        satisfy my demand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was trembling with emotion while he spoke and the desire to kill the man
                        before him was making a frightful struggle with his priestly conscience; but
                        conscience had the upper hand. Hamilton stood gazing fixedly, pale as a
                        ghost, his thoughts becoming more and more clear and logical. He was in a
                        bad situation. Every word that Father Beret had spoken was true and went
                        home with force. There was no time for parley or subterfuge; the sword
                        looked as if, eager to find his heart, it could not be held back another
                        moment. But the wan, cold face of the girl had more power than the
                        rapier&apos;s hungry point. It made an abject coward of him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am willing to give you my word,&quot; he presently said.
                        &quot;And let me tell you,&quot; he went on more rapidly,
                        &quot;I did not shoot at her. She was behind you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your word as a British officer?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-345" n="333"/>
                    <p>Hamilton again stiffened and hesitated, but only for the briefest space, then
                        said: &quot;Yes, my word as a British officer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret waved his hand with impatience.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go, then, back to your place in the fort and disturb my people no
                        more. The soul of this poor little girl will haunt you forever.
                        Go!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton stood a little while gazing at the face of Alice with the horrible
                        wistfulness of remorse. What would he not have given to rub his eyes and
                        find it all a dream?</p>
                    <p>He turned away; a cloud scudded across the moon; here and yonder in the dim
                        town cocks crowed with a lonesome, desultory effect.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret plucked up the rapier that he had wrenched from
                        Hamilton&apos;s hand. It suggested some-thing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold!&quot; he called out, &quot;give me the scabbard of
                        this sword.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton, who was striding vigorously in the direction of the fort, turned
                        about as the priest hastened to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give me the scabbard of this rapier; I want it. Take it
                        off.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The command was not gently voiced. A hoarse, half-whisper winged every word
                        with an imperious threat.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton obeyed. His hands were not firm; his fingers fumbled nervously; but
                        he hurried, and Father Beret soon had the rapier sheathed and secured at his
                        belt beside its mate.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-346" n="334"/>
                    <p>A good and true priest is a burden-bearer. His motto is: <hi rend="i">Alter
                            alterius onera portate;</hi> bear ye one another&apos;s burdens. His
                        soul is enriched with the cast-off sorrows of those whom he relieves. Father
                        Beret scarcely felt the weight of Alice&apos;s body when he lifted it
                        from the ground, so heavy was the pressure of his grief. All that her death
                        meant, not only to him, but to every person who knew her, came into his
                        heart as the place of refuge consecrated for the indwelling of pain. He
                        lifted her and bore her as far toward Roussillon place as he could; but his
                        strength fell short just in front of the little Bourcier cottage, and half
                        dead he staggered across the veranda to the door, where he sank exhausted.</p>
                    <p>After a breathing spell he knocked. The household, fast asleep, did not hear;
                        but he persisted until the door was opened to him and his burden.</p>
                    <p>Captain Farnsworth unclosed his bloodshot eyes, at about eight
                        o&apos;clock in the morning, quite confused as to his place and
                        surroundings. He looked about drowsily with a sheepish half-knowledge of
                        having been very drunk. A purring in his head and a dull ache reminded him
                        of an abused stomach. He yawned and stretched himself, then sat up, running
                        a hand through his tousled hair. Father Beret was on his knees before the
                        cross, still as a statue, his clasped hands extended upward.</p>
                    <p>Farnsworth&apos;s face lighted with recognition, and he smiled rather
                        bitterly. He recalled everything and felt ashamed, humiliated, self-debased.
                        He had outraged <pb id="VAA2387-347" n="335"/> even a priest&apos;s
                        hospitality with his brutish appetite, and he hated himself for it. Disgust
                        nauseated his soul apace with the physical sinking and squirming that grew
                        upon him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m a shabby, worthless dog!&quot; he muttered, with
                        petulant accent; &quot;why don&apos;t you kick me out,
                        Father?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The priest turned a collapsed and bloodless gray face upon him, smiled in a
                        tired, perfunctory way, crossed himself absently and said: &quot;You
                        have rested well, my son. Hard as the bed is, you have done it a compliment
                        in the way of sleeping. You young soldiers understand how to get the most
                        out of things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are too generous, Father, and I can&apos;t appreciate it. I
                        know what I deserve, and you know it, too. Tell me what a brute and fool I
                        am; it will do me good. Punch me a solid jolt in the ribs, like the one you
                        gave me not long ago.&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Qui sine peccato est, primus lapidem
                            mittat,&quot;</hi> said the priest. &quot;Let him who is without
                        sin cast the first stone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He had gone to the hearth and was taking from the embers an earthen saucer,
                        or shallow bowl, in which some fragrant broth simmered and steamed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A man who has slept as long as you have, my son, usually has a
                        somewhat delicate appetite. Now, here is a soup, not especially satisfying
                        to the taste of a gourmet like yourself, but possessing the soothing quality
                        that is good for one just aroused from an unusual nap. I offer it, my son,
                            <hi rend="i">propter stomachum tuum, et frequentes tuas
                        infirmitates</hi> (on account of <pb id="VAA2387-348" n="336"/> thy stomach,
                        and thine often infirmities). This soup will go to the right spot.&quot;</p>
                    <p>While speaking he brought the hot bowl to Farnsworth and set it on the
                        bedcover before him, then fetched a big horn spoon.</p>
                    <p>The fragrance of pungent roots and herbs, blent with a savory waft of buffalo
                        meat, greeted the Captain&apos;s sense, and the anticipation itself
                        cheered his aching throat. It made him feel greedy and in a hurry. The first
                        spoonful, a trifle bitter, was not so pleasant at the beginning, but a
                        moment after he swallowed it a hot prickling set in and seemed to dart
                        through him from extremity to extremity.</p>
                    <p>Slowly, as he ate, the taste grew more agreeable, and all the effects of his
                        debauch disappeared. It was like magic; his blood warmed and glowed, as if
                        touched with mysterious fire.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is this in this soup, Father Beret, that makes it so searching
                        and refreshing?&quot; he demanded, when the bowl was empty.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret shook his head and smiled drolly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That I cannot divulge, my son, owing to a promise I had to make to
                        the aged Indian who gave me the secret. It is the elixer of the Miamis. Only
                        their consecrated medicine men hold the recipe. The stimulation is but
                        temporary.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Just then someone knocked on the door. Father Beret opened it to one of
                        Hamilton&apos;s aides.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your pardon, Father, but hearing Captain Farnsworth&apos;s
                        voice I made bold to knock.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it, Bobby?&quot; Farnsworth called out.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-349" n="337"/>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing, only the Governor has been having you looked for in every
                        nook and corner of the fort and town. You&apos;d better report at once,
                        or he&apos;ll be having us drag the river for your body.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right, Lieutenant, go back and keep mum, that&apos;s a dear
                        boy, and I&apos;ll shuffle into Colonel Hamilton&apos;s august
                        presence before many minutes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The aide laughed and went his way whistling a merry tune.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now I am sure to get what I deserve, with usury at forty per cent
                        in advance,&quot; said Farnsworth dryly, shrugging his shoulders with
                        undissembled dread of Hamilton&apos;s wrath. But the anticipation was
                        not realized. The Governor received Farnsworth stiffly enough, yet in a way
                        that suggested a suppressed desire to avoid explanations on the
                        Captain&apos;s part and a reprimand on his own. In fact, Hamilton was
                        hoping that something would turn up to shield him from the effect of his
                        terrible midnight adventure, which seemed the darker the more he thought of
                        it. He had a slow, numb conscience, lying deep where it was hard to reach,
                        and when a qualm somehow entered it he endured in secret what most men would
                        have cast off or confessed. He was haunted, if not with remorse, at least by
                        a dread of something most disagreeable in connection with what he had done.
                        Alice&apos;s white face had impressed itself indelibly on his memory, so
                        that it met his inner vision at every turn. He was afraid to converse with
                        Farnsworth lest she should come up for discussion; consequently their
                        interview was curt and formal.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-350" n="338"/>
                    <p>It was soon discovered that Alice had escaped from the stockade, and some
                        show of search was made for her by Hamilton&apos;s order, but Farnsworth
                        looked to it that the order was not carried out. He thought he saw at once
                        that his chief knew where she was. The mystery perplexed and pained the
                        young man, and caused him to fear all sorts of evil; but there was a chance
                        that Alice had found a safe retreat and he knew that nothing but ill could
                        befall her if she were discovered and brought back to the fort. Therefore
                        his search for her became his own secret and for his own heart&apos;s
                        ease. And doubtless he would have found her; for even handicapped and
                        distorted love like his is lynx-eyed and sure on the track of its object;
                        but a great event intervened and swept away his opportunity.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton&apos;s uneasiness, which was that of a strong, misguided nature
                        trying to justify itself amid a confusion of unmanageable doubts and
                        misgivings, now vented itself in a resumption of the repairs he had been
                        making at certain points in the fort. These he completed just in time for
                        the coming of Clark.</p>

                    <head type="main">CHAPTER XIX</head>
                    <head type="subtitle">THE ATTACK</head>
                    <p>It has already been mentioned that Indians, arriving singly or in squads, to
                        report at Hamilton&apos;s head-quarters, were in the habit of firing
                        their guns before entering the town or the fort, not only as a signal of
                        their approach, but in order to rid their weapons of their charges
                        preliminary to cleaning them before setting out upon another scalp-hunting
                        expedition. A shot, therefore, or even a volley, heard on the outskirts of
                        the village, was not a noticeable incident in the daily and nightly
                        experience of the garrison. Still, for some reason, Governor Hamilton
                        started violently when, just after nightfall, five or six rifles cracked
                        sharply a short distance from the stockade.</p>
                    <p>He and Helm with two other officers were in the midst of a game of cards,
                        while a kettle, swinging on a crane in the ample fire-place, sang a shrill
                        promise of hot apple-jack toddy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By Jove!&quot; exclaimed Farnsworth, who, although not in the
                        game, was amusing himself with looking on; &quot;you jump like a fine
                        lady! I almost fancied I heard a bullet hit you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You may all jump while you can,&quot; remarked Helm.
                        &quot;That&apos;s Clark, and your time&apos;s short.
                        He&apos;ll have this fort tumbling on your heads before daylight of
                        to-morrow morning comes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As he spoke he arose from his seat at the card <pb id="VAA2387-352" n="340"/>
                        table and went to look after the toddy, which, as an expert, he had under
                        supervision.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton frowned. The mention of Clark was disturbing. Ever since the strange
                        disappearance of Lieutenant Barlow he had nursed the fear that possibly
                        Clark&apos;s scouts had captured him and that the American forces might
                        be much nearer than Kaskaskia. Besides, his nerves were unruly, as they had
                        been ever since the encounter with Father Beret; and his vision persisted in
                        turning back upon the accusing cold face of Alice, lying in the moonlight.
                        One little detail of that scene almost maddened him at times; it was a
                        sheeny, crinkled wisp of warm looking hair looped across the cheek in which
                        he had often seen a saucy dimple dance when Alice spoke or smiled. He was
                        bad enough, but not wholly bad, and the thought of having darkened those
                        merry eyes and stilled those sweet dimples tore through him with a cold,
                        rasping pang.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just as soon as this toddy is properly mixed and
                        tempered,&quot; said Helm, with a magnetic jocosity beaming from his
                        genial face, &quot;I&apos;m going to propose a toast to the banner
                        of Alice Roussillon, which a whole garrison of British braves has been
                        unable to take!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you do I&apos;ll blow a hole through you as big as the south
                        door of hell,&quot; said Hamilton, in a voice fairly shaken to a husky
                        quaver with rage. &quot;You may do a great many insulting things; but
                        not that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Helm was in a half stooping attitude with a ladle in one hand, a cup in the
                        other. He had met Hamilton&apos;s glowering look with a peculiarly
                        innocent smile, <pb id="VAA2387-353" n="341"/> as if to say: &quot;What
                        in the world is the matter now? I never felt in a better humor in all my
                        life. Can&apos;t you take a joke, I wonder?&quot; He did not speak,
                        however, for a rattling volley of musket and rifle shots hit the top of the
                        clay-daubed chimney, sending down into the toddy a shower of soot and dirt.</p>
                    <p>In a wink every man was on his feet and staring.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said Helm, with an impressive oath,
                        &quot;that is Clark&apos;s soldiers, and they will take your fort;
                        but they ought not to have spoiled this apple toddy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, the devil!&quot; said Hamilton, forcibly resuming a calm
                        countenance, &quot;it is only a squad of drunken Indians coming in.
                        We&apos;ll forego excitement; there&apos;s no battle on hand,
                        gentlemen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m glad you think so, Governor Hamilton,&quot; Helm
                        responded, &quot;but I should imagine that I ought to know the crack of
                        a Kentucky rifle. I&apos;ve heard one occasionally in my life. Besides,
                        I got a whiff of free-dom just now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Captain Helm is right,&quot; observed Farnsworth.
                        &quot;That is an attack.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Another volley, this time nearer and more concentrated, convinced Hamilton
                        that he was, indeed, at the opening of a fight. Even while he was giving
                        some hurried orders to his officers, a man was wounded at one of the
                        port-holes. Then came a series of yells, answered by a ripple of sympathetic
                        French shouting that ran throughout the town. The patrol guards came
                        straggling in, breathless with excitement. They swore to having seen a
                        thousand men marching across the water-covered meadows.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-354" n="342"/>
                    <p>Hamilton was brave. The approach of danger stirred him like a trumpet-strain.
                        His fighting blood rose to full tide, and he gave his orders with the
                        steadiness and commanding force of a born soldier. The officers hastened to
                        their respective positions. On all sides sounds indicative of rapid
                        preparations for the fight mingled into a confused strain of military
                        energy. Men marched to their places; cannon were wheeled into position, and
                        soon enough the firing began in good earnest.</p>
                    <p>Late in the afternoon a rumor of Clark&apos;s approach had gone abroad
                        through the village; but not a French lip breathed it to a friend of the
                        British. The creoles were loyal to the cause of freedom; moreover, they
                        cordially hated Hamilton, and their hearts beat high at the prospect of a
                        change in masters at the fort. Every cabin had its hidden gun and supply of
                        ammunition, despite the order to disarm issued by Hamilton. There was a
                        hustling to bring these forth, which was accompanied with a guarded yet
                        irrepressible chattering, delightfully French and infinitely volatile.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Tiens! je vais frotter mon fusil. J&apos;ai vu un
                            singe!&quot;</hi> said Jaques Bourcier to his daughter, the pretty
                        Adrienne, who was coming out of the room in which Alice lay.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw a monkey just now; I must rub up my gun!&quot; He could
                        not be solemn; not he. The thought of an opportunity to get even with
                        Hamilton was like wine in his blood.</p>
                    <p>If you had seen those hardy and sinewy Frenchmen gliding in the dusk of
                        evening from cottage to <pb id="VAA2387-355" n="343"/> cottage, passing the
                        word that the Americans had arrived, saying airy things and pinching one
                        another as they met and hurried on, you would have thought something very
                        amusing and wholly jocund was in preparation for the people of Vincennes.</p>
                    <p>There was a current belief in the town that Gaspard Roussillon never missed a
                        good thing and always some-how got the lion&apos;s share. He went out
                        with the ebb to return on the flood. Nobody was surprised, therefore, when
                        he suddenly appeared in the midst of his friends, armed to the teeth and
                        emotionally warlike to suit the occasion. Of course he took charge of
                        everybody and everything. You could have heard him whisper a bowshot away.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Taisons!&quot;</hi> he hissed, whenever he met an
                        acquaintance. &quot;We will surprise the fort and scalp the whole
                        garrison. <hi rend="i">Aux armes! les Americains viennent
                            d&apos;arriver!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>At his own house he knocked and called in vain. He shook the door violently;
                        for he was thinking of the stores under the floor, of the grimy bottles, of
                        the fragrant Bordeauxah, his throat, how it throbbed! But where was Madame
                        Roussillon? Where was Alice? &quot;Jean! Jean!&quot; he cried,
                        forgetting all precaution, &quot;come here, you scamp, and let me in
                        this minute!&quot;</p>
                    <p>A profoundly impressive silence gave him to understand that his home was
                        deserted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Chiff! frightened and gone to stay with Madame Godre, I supposeand
                        I so thirsty! Bah! hum, hum, <hi rend="i">aprs le vin la bataille,
                            ziff!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>He kicked in the door and groped his way to the <pb id="VAA2387-356" n="344"
                        /> liquors. While he hastily swigged and smacked he heard the firing begin
                        with a crackling, desultory volley. He laughed jovially, there in the dark,
                        between draughts and deep sighs of enjoyment.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Et moi aussi,&quot;</hi> he murmured, like the
                        vast murmur of the sea, &quot;I want to be in that dance! <hi rend="i"
                            >Pardonnez, messieurs. Moi, je veux danser, s&apos;il vous
                            plait.&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>And when he had filled himself he plunged out and rushed away, wrought up to
                        the extreme fighting pitch of temper. <hi rend="i">Diable!</hi> if he could
                        but come across that Lieutenant Barlow, how he would smash him and mangle
                        him! In magnifying his prowess with the lens of imagination he swelled and
                        puffed as he lumbered along.</p>
                    <p>The firing sounded as if it were between the fort and the river; but
                        presently when one of Hamilton&apos;s cannon spoke, M. Roussillon saw
                        the yellow spike of flame from its muzzle leap directly toward the church,
                        and he thought it best to make a wide detour to avoid going between the
                        firing lines. Once or twice he heard the whine of a stray bullet high
                        overhead. Before he had gone very far he met a man hurrying toward the fort.
                        It was Captain Francis Maisonville, one of Hamilton&apos;s chief scouts,
                        who had been out on a reconnoissance and, cut off from his party by some of
                        Clark&apos;s forces, was trying to make his way to the main gate of the
                        stockade.</p>
                    <p>M. Roussillon knew Maisonville as a somewhat desperate character, a leader of
                        Indian forays and a trader in human scalps. Surely the fellow was legitimate
                        prey.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-357" n="345"/>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Ziff! diable de gredin!&quot;</hi> he snarled,
                        and leaping upon him choked him to the ground. <hi rend="i">&quot;Je
                            vais vous scalper immdiatement!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Clark&apos;s plan of approach showed masterly strategy. Lieutenant
                        Bailey, with fourteen regulars, made a show of attack on the east, while
                        Major Bowman led a company through the town, on a line near where Main
                        street in Vincennes is now located, to a point north of the stockade.
                        Charleville, a brave creole, who was at the head of some daring fellows, by
                        a brilliant dash got position under cover of a natural terrace at the edge
                        of the prairie, opposite the fort&apos;s southwestern angle. Lieutenant
                        Beverley, in whom the commander placed highest confidence, was sent to look
                        for a supply of ammunition, and to gather up all the Frenchmen in the town
                        who wished to join in the attack. Oncle Jazon and ten other available men
                        went with him.</p>
                    <p>They all made a great noise when they felt that the place was completely
                        invested. Nor can we deny, much as we would like to, the strong desire for
                        vengeance which raised those shouting voices and nerved those steady hearts
                        to do or die in an undertaking which certainly had a desperate look.
                        Patriotism of the purest strain those men had, and that alone would have
                        borne them up; but the recollection of smouldering cabin homes in Kentucky,
                        of women and children murdered and scalped, of men brave and true burned at
                        the stake, and of all the indescribable outrages of Indian warfare incited
                        and rewarded by the commander of the fort yonder, added to patriotism the
                            <pb id="VAA2387-358" n="346"/> terrible urge of that dark passion which
                        clamors for blood to quench the fire of wrath. Not a few of those wet,
                        half-frozen, emaciated soldiers of freedom had experienced the soul rending
                        shock of returning from a day&apos;s hunting in the forest to find home
                        in ashes and loved ones brutally murdered and scalped, or dragged away to
                        unspeakable outrage under circumstances too harrowing for description, the
                        bare thought of which turns our blood cold, even at this distance. Now the
                        opportunity had arrived for a stroke of retaliation. The thought was
                        tremendously stimulating.</p>
                    <p>Beverley, with the aid of Oncle Jazon, was able to lead his little company as
                        far as the church before the enemy saw him. Here a volley from the nearest
                        angle of the stockade had to be answered, and pretty soon a cannon began to
                        play upon the position.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We kin do better some&apos;rs else,&quot; was Oncle
                        Jazon&apos;s laconic remark flung back over his shoulder, as he moved
                        briskly away from the spot just swept by a six-pounder. &quot;Come this
                        yer way, Lieutenant. I hyer some o&apos; the fellers a talkin&apos;
                        loud jes&apos; beyant Legrace&apos;s place. They ain&apos;t no
                        sort o&apos; sense a tryin&apos; to hit anything a shootin&apos;
                        in the dark nohow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When they reached the thick of the town there was a strange stir in the dusky
                        streets. Men were slipping from house to house, arming themselves and
                        joining their neighbors. Clark had sent an order earlier in the evening
                        forbidding any street demonstration by the inhabitants; but he might as well
                        have ordered the wind not to blow or the river to stand still. Oncle Jazon
                        knew every man whose outlines he could see or <pb id="VAA2387-359" n="347"/>
                        whose voice he heard. He called each one by name: &quot;Here, Roger,
                        fall in!Come Louis, Alphonse, Victor, Octave<hi rend="i">venez ici,</hi>
                        here&apos;s the American army, come with me!&quot; His rapid French
                        phrases leaped forth as if shot from a pistol, and his shrill voice,
                        familiar to every ear in Vincennes, drew the creole militiamen to him, and
                        soon Beverley&apos;s company had doubled its numbers, while at the same
                        time its enthusiasm and ability to make a noise had increased in a far
                        greater proportion. In accordance with an order from Clark they now took
                        position near the northeast corner of the stockade and began firing,
                        although in the darkness there was but little opportunity for marksmanship.</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon had found citizens Legrace and Bos-seron, and through them
                        Clark&apos;s men were supplied with ammunition, of which they stood
                        greatly in need, their powder having got wet during their long, watery
                        march. By nine o&apos;clock the fort was completely surrounded, and from
                        every direction the riflemen and musketeers were pouring in volley after
                        volley. Beverley with his men took the cover of a fence and some houses
                        sixty yards from the stockade. Here to their surprise they found themselves
                        below the line of Hamilton&apos;s cannon, which, being planted on the
                        second floor of the fort, could not be sufficiently depressed to bear upon
                        them. A well directed musket fire, however, fell from the loopholes of the
                        blockhouses, the bullets rattling merrily against the cover behind which the
                        attacking forces lay.</p>
                    <p>Beverley was thinking of Alice during every moment <pb id="VAA2387-360"
                            n="348"/> of all this stir and tumult. He feared that she might still be
                        a prisoner in the fort exposed to the very bullets that his men were
                        discharging at every crack and cranny of those loosely constructed
                        buildings. Should he ever see her again? Would she care for him? What would
                        be the end of all this terrible suspense? Those remote forebodings of evils,
                        formless, shadowy, ineffable, which have harried the lover&apos;s heart
                        since time began, crowded all pleasant anticipations out of his mind.</p>
                    <p>Clark, in passing hurriedly from company to company around the line, stopped
                        for a little while when he found Beverley.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you plenty of ammunition?&quot; was his first inquiry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A mighty sight more&apos;n we kin see to shoot with,&quot;
                        spoke up Oncle Jazon. &quot;It&apos;s a right smart o&apos; dad
                        burn foolishness to be wastin&apos; it on nothin&apos;; seems like
                        to me &apos;at we&apos;d better set the dasted fort afire
                        an&apos; smoke the skunks out!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Speak when you are spoken to, my man,&quot; said the Colonel a
                        trifle hotly, and trying by a sharp scrutiny to make him out in the gloom
                        where he crouched.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Ventrebleu!</hi> I&apos;m not askin&apos; <hi
                            rend="i">you,</hi> Colonel Clark, nor no other man, when I shill speak.
                        I talks whenever I gits ready, an&apos; I shoots jes&apos; the same
                        way. So ye&apos;d better go on &apos;bout yer business like a white
                        man! Close up yer own whopper jawed mouth, ef ye want anything shet
                        up!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oho! is that you, Jazon? You&apos;re so little I
                        didn&apos;t know you! Certainly, talk your whole damned under <pb
                            id="VAA2387-361" n="349"/> jaw off, for all I care,&quot; Clark
                        replied, assuming a jocose tone. Then turning again to Beverley:
                        &quot;Keep up the firing and the noise; the fort will be ours in the
                        morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the use of waiting till morning?&quot; Beverley
                        demanded with impatience. &quot;We can tear that stockade to pieces with
                        our hands in half an hour.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think so, Lieutenant. It is better to play for the
                        sure thing. Keep up the racket, and be ready for &apos;em if they rush
                        out. We must not fail to capture the hair-buyer General.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He passed on, with something cheerful to say whenever he found a squad of his
                        devoted men. He knew how to humor and manage those independent and
                        undisciplined yet heroically brave fellows. What to see and hear, what to
                        turn aside as a joke, what to insist upon with inflexible mastery, he knew
                        by the fine instantaneous sense of genius. There were many men of Oncle
                        Jazon&apos;s cast, true as steel, but refractory as flint, who could not
                        be dominated by any person, no matter of what stamp or office. To them an
                        order was an insult; but a suggestion pleased and captured them. Strange as
                        it may seem, theirs was the conquering spirit of Americathe spirit which has
                        survived every turn of progress and built up the great body of our
                        independence.</p>
                    <p>Beverley submitted to Clark&apos;s plan with what patience he could, and
                        all night long fired shot for shot with the best riflemen in his squad. It
                        was a fatiguing performance, with apparently little result beyond forcing
                        the garrison now and again to close the embrasures, <pb id="VAA2387-362"
                            n="350"/> thus periodically silencing the cannon. Toward the close of
                        the night a relaxation showed itself in the shouting and firing all round
                        the line. Beverley&apos;s men, especially the creoles, held out bravely
                        in the matter of noise; but even they flagged at length, their volatility
                        simmering down to desultory bubbling and half sleepy chattering and
                        chaffing.</p>
                    <p>Beverley leaned upon a rude fence, and for a time neglected to reload his hot
                        rifle. Of course he was thinking of Alice,he really could not think in any
                        other direction; but it gave him a shock and a start when he presently heard
                        her name mentioned by a little Frenchman near him on the left.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;ll never be another such a girl in Post Vincennes as
                        Alice Roussillon,&quot; the fellow said in the soft creole patois,
                        &quot;and to think of her being shot like a dog!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And by a man who calls himself a Governor, too!&quot; said
                        another. &quot;Ah, as for myself, I&apos;m in favor of burning him
                        alive when we capture him. That&apos;s me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Et moi aussi,&quot;</hi> chimed in a third voice.
                        &quot;That poor girl must be avenged. The man who shot her must die.
                        Holy Virgin, but if Gaspard Roussillon were only here!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But he <hi rend="i">is</hi> here; I saw him just after dark. He was
                        in great fighting temper, that terrible man. <hi rend="i">Ouf!</hi> but I
                        should not like to be Colonel Hamilton and fall in the way of that Gaspard
                        Roussillon!&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Morbleu!</hi> I should say not. You may leave me out
                        of a chance like that! I shouldn&apos;t mind seeing Gaspard handle the
                        Governor, though. Ah, that would <pb id="VAA2387-363" n="351"/> be too good!
                        He&apos;d pay him up for shooting Mademoiselle Alice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley could scarcely hold himself erect by the fence; the smoky, foggy
                        landscape swam round him heavy and strange. He uttered a groan, which
                        brought Oncle Jazon to his side in a hurry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Qu&apos; avez-vous?</hi> What&apos;s the
                        matter?&quot; the old man demanded with quick sympathy. &quot;Hev
                        they hit ye? Lieutenant, air ye hurt much?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley did not hear the old man&apos;s words, did not feel his kindly
                        touch.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Alice! Alice!&quot; he murmured, &quot;dead,
                        dead!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ya-as,&quot; drawled Oncle Jazon, &quot;I hearn about it
                        soon as I got inter town. It&apos;s a sorry thing, a mighty sorry thing.
                        But mebby I won&apos;t do a little somepin&apos; to that&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley straightened himself and lifted his gun, forgetting that he had not
                        reloaded it since firing last. He leveled it at the fort and touched the
                        trigger. Simultaneously with his movement an embrasure opened and a cannon
                        flashed, its roar flanked on either side by a crackling of British muskets.
                        Some bullets struck the fence and flung splinters into Oncle
                        Jazon&apos;s face. A cannon ball knocked a ridge pole from the roof of a
                        house hard by, and sent it whirling through the air.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Ventrebleu!et aprs?</hi> What the devil next? Better
                        knock a feller&apos;s eyes out!&quot; the old man cried. &quot;I
                        ain&apos;t a doin&apos; nothin&apos; to ye!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He capered around rubbing his leathery face after the manner of a scalded
                        monkey. Beverley was struck in the breast by a flattened and spent ball that
                        glanced <pb id="VAA2387-364" n="352"/> from a fence-picket. The shock caused
                        him to stagger and drop his gun; but he quickly picked it up and turned to
                        his companion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you hurt, Oncle Jazon?&quot; he inquired. &quot;Are you
                        hurt?&apos;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not a bitjes&apos; skeert mos&apos; into a duck fit.
                        Thought a cannon ball had knocked my whole dang face down my throat!
                        Nothin&apos; but a handful o&apos; splinters in my poorty
                        count&apos;nance, makin&apos; my head feel like a
                        porc&apos;pine. But I sort o&apos; thought I heard somepin&apos;
                        give you a diff.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Something did hit me,&quot; said Beverley, laying a hand on his
                        breast, &quot;but I don&apos;t think it was a bullet. They seem to
                        be getting our range at last. Tell the men to keep well under cover. They
                        must not expose themselves until we are ready to charge.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The shock had brought him back to his duty as a leader of his little company,
                        and with the funeral bell of all his life&apos;s happiness tolling in
                        his agonized heart he turned afresh to directing the fire upon the
                        block-house.</p>
                    <p>About this time a runner came from Clark with an order to cease firing and
                        let a returning party of British scouts under Captain Lamothe re-enter the
                        fort unharmed. A strange order it seemed to both officers and men; but it
                        was implicitly obeyed. Clark&apos;s genius here made another fine
                        strategic flash. He knew that unless he let the scouts go back into the
                        stockade they would escape by running away, and might possibly organize an
                        army of Indians with which to succor Hamilton. But if they were permitted to
                        go inside they <pb id="VAA2387-365" n="353"/> could be captured with the
                        rest of the garrison; hence his order.</p>
                    <p>A few minutes passed in dead silence; then Captain Lamothe and his party
                        marched close by where Beverley&apos;s squad was lying concealed. It was
                        a difficult task to restrain the creoles, for some of them hated Lamothe.
                        Oncle Jazon squirmed like a snake while they filed past all unaware that an
                        enemy lurked so near. When they reached the fort, ladders were put down for
                        them and they began to clamber over the wall, crowding and pushing one
                        another in wild haste. Oncle Jazon could hold in no longer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ya! ya! ya!&quot; he yelled. &quot;Look out! the ladder is
                        a fallin&apos; wi&apos; ye!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then all the lurking crowd shouted as one man, and, sure enough, down came a
                        laddermen and all in a crashing heap.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Silence! silence!&quot; Beverley commanded; but he could not
                        check the wild jeering and laughing, while the bruised and frightened scouts
                        hastily erected their ladder again, fairly tumbling over one another in
                        their haste to ascend, and so cleared the wall, falling into the stockade to
                        join the garrison.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Ventrebleu!</hi>&quot; shrieked Oncle Jazon.
                        &quot;They&apos;ve gone to bed; but we&apos;ll wake &apos;em
                        up at the crack o&apos; day an&apos; give &apos;em a
                        breakfas&apos; o&apos; hot lead!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Now the fighting was resumed with redoubled spirit and noise, and when
                        morning came, affording sufficient light to bring out the &quot;bead
                        sights&quot; on the Kentucky rifles, the matchless marksmen in
                        Clark&apos;s band forced the British to close the embrasures and
                        entirely <pb id="VAA2387-366" n="354"/> cease trying to use their cannon;
                        but the fight with small arms went merrily on until the middle of the
                        forenoon.</p>
                    <p>Meantime Gaspard Roussillon had tied Francis Maisonville&apos;s hands
                        fast and hard with the strap of his bullet-pouch.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, I&apos;ll scalp you,&quot; he said in a rumbling tone,
                        terrible to hear. And with his words out came his hunting knife from its
                        sheath.</p>
                    <p>&quot;O have mercy, my dear Monsieur Roussillon!&quot; cried the
                        panting captive; &quot;have mercy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mercy! yes, like your Colonel&apos;s, that&apos;s what
                        you&apos;ll get. You stand by that <hi rend="i">forban</hi>, that <hi
                            rend="i">sclrat</hi>, that bandit, and help him. Oh, yes,
                        you&apos;ll get mercy! Yes, the same mercy that he showed to my poor
                        little Alice! Your scalp, Monsieur, if you please! A small matter; it
                        won&apos;t hurt much!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, for the sake of old friendship, Gaspard, for the
                        sake&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ziff! poor little Alice!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I swear to you that I&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Tout de mme, Monsieur, je vais vous scalper
                            maintenant.</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>In fact he had taken off a part of Maisonville&apos;s scalp, when a party
                        of soldiers, among whom was Maisonville&apos;s brother, a brave fellow
                        and loyal to the American cause, were attracted by his cries and came to his
                        rescue.</p>
                    <p>M. Roussillon struggled savagely, insisting upon completing his cruel
                        performance; but he was at last overpowered, partly by brute force and
                        partly by the <pb id="VAA2387-367" n="355"/> pleading of
                        Maisonville&apos;s brother, and made to desist. The big man wept with
                        rage when he saw the bleeding prisoner protected. &quot;<hi rend="i">Eh
                            bien!</hi> I&apos;ll keep what I&apos;ve got,&quot; he
                        roared, &quot;and I&apos;ll take the rest of it next time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shook the tuft of hair at Maisonville and glared like a mad bull.</p>
                    <p>Two or three other members of Lamothe&apos;s band were captured about the
                        same time by some of the French militiamen; and Clark, when on his round
                        cheering and directing his forces, discovered that these prisoners were
                        being used as shields. Some young creoles, gay with drink and the
                        stimulating effect of fight, had bound the poor fellows and were firing from
                        behind them! Of course the commander promptly put an end to this cruelty;
                        but they considered it exquisite fun while it lasted. It was in broad
                        daylight, and they knew that the English in the fort could see what they
                        were doing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s shameful to treat prisoners in this way,&quot;
                        said Clark. &quot;I will not permit it. Shoot the next man that offers
                        to do such a thing!&quot;</p>
                    <p>One of the creole youths, a handsome, swarthy Adonis in buckskin, tossed his
                        shapely head with a debonair smile and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;To be sure, <hi rend="i">mon Colonel!</hi> but what have they been
                        doing to us? We have amused them all winter; it&apos;s but fair that
                        they should give us a little fun now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Clark shrugged his broad shoulders and passed on. He understood perfectly
                        what the people of Vincennes had suffered under Hamilton&apos;s brutal
                        administration.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-368" n="356"/>
                    <p>At nine o&apos;clock an order was passed to cease firing, and a flag of
                        truce was seen going from Clark&apos;s head-quarters to the fort. It was
                        a peremptory demand for unconditional surrender. Hamilton refused, and
                        fighting was fiercely resumed from behind rude breast-works meantime
                        erected. Every loop-hole and opening of whatever sort was the focus into
                        which the unerring backwoods rifles sent their deadly bullets. Men began to
                        fall in the fort, and every moment Hamilton expected an assault in force on
                        all sides of the stockade. This, if successful, would mean inevitable
                        massacre. Clark had warned him of the terrible consequences of holding out
                        until the worst should come. &quot;For,&quot; said he in his note to
                        the Governor, &quot;if I am obliged to storm, you may depend upon such
                        treatment as is justly due to a murderer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Historians have wondered why Hamilton became so excited and acted so
                        strangely after receiving the note. The phrase, &quot;<hi rend="i"
                            >justly due to a murderer</hi>,&quot; is the key to the mystery.
                        When he read it his heart sank and a terrible fear seized him.
                        &quot;Justly due to a murderer!&quot; ah, that calm, white,
                        beautiful girlish face, dead in the moonlight, with the wisp of shining hair
                        across it! &quot;Such treatment as is justly due to a
                        murderer!&quot; Cold drops of sweat broke out on his forehead and a
                        shiver went through his body.</p>
                    <p>During the truce Clark&apos;s weary yet still enthusiastic besiegers
                        enjoyed a good breakfast prepared for them by the loyal dames of Vincennes.
                        Little Adrienne Bourcier was one of the handmaidens of the occasion. She
                        brought to Beverley&apos;s squad a basket, <pb id="VAA2387-369" n="357"
                        /> almost as large as herself, heaped high with roasted duck and warm
                        wheaten bread, while another girl bore two huge jugs of coffee, fragrant and
                        steaming hot. The men cheered them lustily and complimented them without
                        reserve, so that before their service was over their faces were glowing with
                        delight.</p>
                    <p>And yet Adrienne&apos;s heart was uneasy, and full of longing to hear
                        something of Ren de Ronville. Surely some one of her friends must know
                        something about him. Ah, there was Oncle Jazon! Doubtless he could tell her
                        all that she wanted to know. She lingered, after the food was distributed,
                        and shyly inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hain&apos;t seed the scamp,&quot; said Oncle Jazon, only he
                        used the patois most familiar to the girl&apos;s ear. &quot;Killed
                        an&apos; scelped long ago, I reckon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His mouth was so full that he spoke mumblingly and with utmost difficulty.
                        Nor did he glance at Adrienne, whose face took on as great pallor as her
                        brown complexion could show.</p>
                    <p>Beverley ate but little of the food. He sat apart on a piece of timber that
                        projected from the rough breastwork and gave himself over to infinite misery
                        of spirit, which was trebled when he took Alice&apos;s locket from his
                        bosom, only to discover that the bullet which struck him had almost entirely
                        destroyed the face of the miniature.</p>
                    <p>He gripped the dinted and twisted case and gazed at it with the stare of a
                        blind man. His heart almost ceased to beat and his breath had the rustling
                        sound we hear when a strong man dies of a sudden wound. Somehow the
                        defacement of the portrait was taken by <pb id="VAA2387-370" n="358"/> his
                        soul as the final touch of fate, signifying that Alice was forever and
                        completely obliterated from his life. He felt a blur pass over his mind. He
                        tried in vain to recall the face and form so dear to him; he tried to
                        imagine her voice; but the whole universe was a vast hollow silence. For a
                        long while he was cold, staring, rigid; then the inevitable collapse came,
                        and he wept as only a strong man can who is hurt to death, yet cannot die.</p>
                    <p>Adrienne approached him, thinking to speak to him about Ren; but he did not
                        notice her, and she went her way, leaving beside him a liberal supply of
                        food.</p>

                    <p>Governor Hamilton received the note sent him by Colonel Clark and replied to
                        it with curt dignity; but his heart was quaking. As a soldier he was true to
                        the military tradition, and nothing could have induced him to surrender his
                        command with dishonor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lieutenant-Governor Hamilton,&quot; he wrote to Clark,
                        &quot;begs leave to acquaint Colonel Clark that he and his garrison are
                        not disposed to be awed into any action unworthy of British
                        subjects.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very brave words,&quot; said Helm, when Hamilton read the note
                        to him, &quot;but you&apos;ll sing a milder tune before many
                        minutes, or you and your whole garrison will perish in a bloody heap. Listen
                        to those wild yells! Clark has enough men to eat you all up for breakfast.
                        You&apos;d better be reasonable and prudent. It&apos;s not bravery
                        to court massacre.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton turned away without a word and sent the message; but Helm saw that
                        he was excited, and could be still further wrought up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are playing into the hands of your bitterest enemies, the
                        frog-eaters,&quot; he went on. &quot;These creoles, over whom
                        you&apos;ve held a hot poker all winter, are crazy to be turned loose
                        upon you; and you know that they&apos;ve got good cause to feel like
                        giving you the extreme penalty. They&apos;ll give it to you without a
                        flinch if they get the chance. You&apos;ve done enough.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-372" n="360"/>
                    <p>Hamilton whirled about and glared ferociously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Helm, what do you mean?&quot; he demanded in a voice as hollow
                        as it was full of desperate passion.</p>
                    <p>The genial Captain laughed, as if he had heard a good joke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You won&apos;t catch any fish if you swear, and you look
                        blasphemous,&quot; he said with the lightness of humor characteristic of
                        him at all times. &quot;You&apos;d better say a prayer or two. Just
                        reflect a moment upon the awful sins you have committed and&quot;</p>
                    <p>A crash of coalescing volleys from every direction broke off his levity.
                        Clark was sending his response to Hamilton&apos;s lofty note. The guns
                        of freedom rang out a prophecy of triumph, and the hissing bullets clucked
                        sharply as they entered the solid logs of the walls or whisked through an
                        aperture and bowled over a man. The British musketeers returned the fire as
                        best they could, with a courage and a stubborn coolness which Helm openly
                        admired, although he could not hide his satisfaction whenever one of them
                        was disabled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lamothe and his men are refusing to obey orders,&quot; said
                        Farnsworth a little later, hastily approaching Hamilton, his face flushed
                        and a gleam of hot anger in his eyes. &quot;They&apos;re in a nasty
                        mood; I can do nothing with them; they have not fired a shot.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mutiny?&quot; Hamilton demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not just that. They say they do not wish to fire on their kinsmen
                        and friends. They are all French, you know, and they see their cousins,
                        brothers, uncles <pb id="VAA2387-373" n="361"/> and old acquaintances out
                        there in Clark&apos;s rabble. I can do nothing with them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shoot the scoundrels, then!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It will be a toss up which of us will come out on top if we try
                        that. Besides, if we begin a fight inside, the Americans will make short
                        work of us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what in hell are we to do, then?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, fight, that&apos;s all,&quot; said Farnsworth
                        apathetically turning to a small loop-hole and leveling a field glass
                        through it. &quot;We might make a rush from the gates and stampede
                        them,&quot; he presently added. Then he uttered an exclamation of great
                        surprise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s Lieutenant Beverley out there,&quot; he
                        exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re mistaken, you&apos;re excited,&quot;
                        Hamilton half sneeringly remarked, yet not without a shade of uneasiness in
                        his expression. &quot;You forget, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look for yourself, it&apos;s easily settled,&quot; and
                        Farnsworth proffered the glass. &quot;He&apos;s there, to a
                        certainty, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw Beverley an hour ago,&quot; said Helm. &quot;I knew
                        all the time that he&apos;d be on hand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was a white lie. Captain Helm was as much surprised as his captors at what
                        he heard; but he could not resist the temptation to be annoying.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton looked as Farnsworth directed, and sure enough, there was the young
                        Virginian Lieutenant, standing on a barricade, his hat off, cheering his men
                        with a superb show of zeal. Not a hair of his head was missing, so far as
                        the glass could be relied upon to show.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-374" n="362"/>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon&apos;s quick old eyes saw the gleam of the telescope tube in
                        the loop-hole.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never could shoot much,&quot; he muttered, and then a little
                        bullet sped with absolute accuracy from his disreputable looking rifle and
                        shattered the object-lens, just as Hamilton moved to withdraw the glass,
                        uttering an ejaculation of intense excitement.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Such devils of marksmen!&quot; said he, and his face was
                        haggard. &quot;That infernal Indian lied.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I could have told you all the time that the scalp Long-Hair brought
                        to you was not Beverley&apos;s,&quot; said Helm indifferently.
                        &quot;I recognized Lieutenant Barlow&apos;s hair as soon as I saw
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This was another piece of off-hand romance. Helm did not dream that he was
                        accidentally sketching a horrible truth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Barlow&apos;s!&quot; exclaimed Farnsworth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, Barlow&apos;s, no mistake&quot;</p>
                    <p>Two more men reeled from a port-hole, the blood spinning far out of their
                        wounds. Indeed, through every aperture in the walls the bullets were now
                        humming like mad hornets.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Close that port-hole!&quot; stormed Hamilton; then turning to
                        Farnsworth he added: &quot;We cannot endure this long. Shut up every
                        place large enough for a bullet to get through. Go all around, give strict
                        orders to all. See that the men do not foolishly expose themselves. Those
                        ruffians out there have located every crack.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His glimpse of Beverley and the sinister remark of Helm had completely
                        unmanned him before his men <pb id="VAA2387-375" n="363"/> fell. Now it
                        rushed upon him that if he would escape the wrath of the maddened creoles
                        and the vengeance of Alice&apos;s lover, he must quickly throw himself
                        upon the mercy of Clark. It was his only hope. He chafed inwardly, but bore
                        himself with stern coolness. He presently sought Farnsworth, pulled him
                        aside and suggested that something must be done to prevent an assault and a
                        massacre. The sounds outside seemed to forebode a gathering for a desperate
                        rush, and in his heart he felt all the terrors of awful anticipation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We are completely at their mercy, that is plain,&quot; he said,
                        shrugging his shoulders and gazing at the wounded men writhing in their
                        agony. &quot;What do you suggest?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Captain Farnsworth was a shrewd officer. He recollected that Philip Dejean,
                        justice of Detroit, was on his way down the Wabash from that post, and
                        probably near at hand, with a flotilla of men and supplies. Why not ask for
                        a few days of truce? It could do no harm, and if agreed to, might be their
                        salvation. Hamilton jumped at the thought, and forthwith drew up a note
                        which he sent out with a white flag. Never before in all his military career
                        had he been so comforted by a sudden cessation of fighting. His soul would
                        grovel in spite of him. Alice&apos;s cold face now had
                        Beverley&apos;s beside it in his field of inner visiona double assurance
                        of impending doom, it seemed to him.</p>
                    <p>There was short delay in the arrival of Colonel Clark&apos;s reply,
                        hastily scrawled on a bit of soiled paper. <pb id="VAA2387-376" n="364"/>
                        The request for a truce was flatly refused; but the note closed thus:</p>
                    <p>&quot;If Mr. Hamilton is Desirous of a Conference with Col. Clark he will
                        meet him at the Church with Captn. Helms.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The spelling was not very good, and there was a redundancy of capital
                        letters; yet Hamilton under-stood it all; and it was very difficult for him
                        to conceal his haste to attend the proposed conference. But he was afraid to
                        go to the churchthe thought chilled him. He could not face Father Beret, who
                        would probably be there. And what if there should be evidences of the
                        funeral?what if?he shuddered and tried to break away from the vision in his
                        tortured brain.</p>
                    <p>He sent a proposition to Clark to meet him on the esplanade before the main
                        gate of the fort; but Clark declined, insisting upon the church. And thither
                        he at last consented to go. It was an immense brace to his spirit to have
                        Helm beside him during that walk, which, although but eighty yards in
                        extent, seemed to him a matter of leagues. On the way he had to pass near
                        the new position taken up by Beverley and his men. It was a fine test of
                        nerve, when the Lieutenant&apos;s eyes met those of the Governor.
                        Neither man permitted the slightest change of countenance to betray his
                        feelings. In fact, Beverley&apos;s face was as rigid as marble; he could
                        not have changed it.</p>
                    <p>But with Oncle Jazon it was a different affair. He had no dignity to
                        preserve, no fine military bearing to sustain, no terrible tug of
                        conscience, no paralyzing <pb id="VAA2387-377" n="365"/> grip of despair on
                        his heart. When he saw Hamilton going by, bearing himself so superbly, it
                        affected the French volatility in his nature to such an extent that his
                        tongue could not be controlled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Va t&apos;en, bte, forban, meurtrier!</hi> Skin
                        out f&apos;om here! beast, robber, murderer!&quot; he cried, in his
                        keen screech-owl voice. &quot;I&apos;ll git thet scelp o&apos;
                        your&apos;n afore sundown, see &apos;f I don&apos;t! Ye onery
                        gal-killer an&apos; ha&apos;r buyer!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The blood in Hamilton&apos;s veins caught no warmth from these remarks;
                        but he held his head high and passed stolidly on, as if he did not hear a
                        word. Helm turned the tail of an eye upon Oncle Jazon and gave him a droll,
                        quizzical wink of approval. In response the old man with grotesque solemnity
                        drew his buck-horn handled knife, licked its blade and returned it to its
                        sheath,a bit of pantomime well understood and keenly enjoyed by the
                        onlooking creoles.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Putois! coquin!</hi>&quot; they jeered,
                            &quot;<hi rend="i">goujat! poltron!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley heard the taunting racket, but did not realize it, which was well
                        enough, for he could not have restrained the bitter effervescence. He stood
                        like a statue, gazing fixedly at the now receding figure, the lofty,
                        cold-faced man in whom centered his hate of hates. Clark had requested him
                        to be present at the conference in the church; but he declined, feeling that
                        he could not meet Hamilton and restrain himself. Now he regretted his
                        refusal, half wishing that no, he could not assassinate an enemy under a
                        white flag. In his heart he prayed that there would be no surrender, that
                        Hamilton would reject every offer. <pb id="VAA2387-378" n="366"/> To storm
                        the fort and revel in butchering its garrison seemed the only desirable
                        thing left for him in life.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret was, indeed, present at the church, as Hamilton had dreaded; and
                        the two duelists gave each other a rapier-like eye-thrust. Neither spoke,
                        however, and Clark immediately demanded a settlement of the matter in hand.
                        He was brusque and imperious to a degree, apparently rather anxious to repel
                        every peaceful advance.</p>
                    <p>It was a laconic interview, crisp as autumn ice and bitter as gallberries.
                        Colonel Clark had no respect whatever for Hamilton, to whom he had applied
                        the imperishable adjective &quot;hair-buyer General.&quot; On the
                        other hand Governor Hamilton, who felt keenly the disgrace of having to
                        equalize himself officially and discuss terms of surrender with a rough
                        backwoodsman, could not conceal his contempt of Clark.</p>
                    <p>The five men of history, Hamilton, Helm, Hay, Clark and Bowman, were not
                        distinguished diplomats. They went at their work rather after the
                        hammer-and-tongs fashion. Clark bluntly demanded unconditional surrender.
                        Hamilton refused. They argued the matter. Helm put in his oar, trying to
                        soften the situation, as was his custom on all occasions, and received from
                        Clark a stinging reprimand, with the reminder that he was nothing but a
                        prisoner on parole, and had no voice at all in settling the terms of
                        surrender.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I release him, sir,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;He is no
                        longer a prisoner. I am quite willing to have Captain Helm join freely in
                        our conference.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I refuse to permit his acceptance of your <pb id="VAA2387-379"
                            n="367"/> favor,&quot; responded Clark. &quot;Captain Helm, you
                        will return with Mr. Hamilton to the fort and remain his captive until I
                        free you by force. Meantime hold your tongue.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret, suave looking and quiet, occupied himself at the little altar,
                        apparently altogether indifferent to what was being said; but he lost not a
                        word of the talk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Qui habet aures audiendi, audial</hi>,&quot; he
                        inwardly repeated, smiling blandly. &quot;<hi rend="i">Gaudete in illa
                            die, et exultate!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton rose to go; deep lines of worry creased his face; but when the party
                        had passed outside, he suddenly turned upon Clark and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why do you demand impossible terms of me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will tell you, sir,&quot; was the stern answer, in a tone in
                        which there was no mercy or compromise. &quot;I would rather have you
                        refuse. I desire nothing so much as an excuse to wreak full and bloody
                        vengeance on every man in that fort who has engaged in the business of
                        employing savages to scalp brave, patriotic men and defenseless women and
                        children. The cries of the widows and the fatherless on our frontiers
                        require the blood of the Indian partisans at my hands. If you choose to risk
                        the massacre of your garrison to save those despicable red-handed partisans,
                        have your pleasure. What you have done you know better than I do. I have a
                        duty to perform. You may be able to soften its nature. I may take it into my
                        head to send for some of our bereaved women <pb id="VAA2387-380" n="368"/>
                        to witness my terrible work and see that it is well done, if you insist upon
                        the worst.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Major Hay, who was Hamilton&apos;s Indian agent, now, with some
                        difficulty clearing his throat, spoke up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pray, sir,&quot; said he, &quot;who is it that you call
                        Indian partisans?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sir,&quot; replied Clark, seeing that his words had gone
                        solidly home, &quot;I take Major Hay to be one of the
                        principals.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This seemed to strike Hay with deadly force. Clark&apos;s report says
                        that he was &quot;pale and trembling, scarcely able to stand,&quot;
                        and that &quot;Hamilton blushed, and, I observed, was much affected at
                        his behavior.&quot; Doubtless, if the doughty American commander had
                        known more about the Governor&apos;s feelings just then, he would have
                        added that an awful fear, even greater than the Indian agent&apos;s, did
                        more than anything else to congest the veins in his face.</p>
                    <p>The parties separated without reaching an agreement; but the end had come.
                        The terror in Hamilton&apos;s soul was doubled by a wild scene enacted
                        under the walls of his fort; a scene which, having no proper place in this
                        story, strong as its historical interest un-questionably is, must be but
                        outlined. A party of Indians returning from a scalping expedition in
                        Kentucky and along the Ohio, was captured on the outskirts of the town by
                        some of Clark&apos;s men, who proceeded to kill and scalp them within
                        full view of the beleaguered garrison, after which their mangled bodies were
                        flung into the river.</p>
                    <p>If the British commander needed further wine of <pb id="VAA2387-381" n="369"
                        /> dread to fill his cup withal, it was furnished by an ostentatious
                        marshaling of the American forces for a general assault. His spirit broke
                        completely, so that it looked like a godsend to him when Clark finally
                        offered terms of honorable surrender, the consummation of which was to be
                        postponed until the following morning. He accepted promptly, appending to
                        the articles of capitulation the following reasons for his action:
                        &quot;The remoteness from succor; the state and quantity of provisions,
                        etc.; unanimity of officers and men in its expediency; the honorable terms
                        allowed; and, lastly, the confidence in a generous enemy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Confidence in a generous enemy! Abject fear of the vengeance just wreaked
                        upon his savage emissaries would have been the true statement. Beverley read
                        the paper when Clark sent for him; but he could not join in the extravagant
                        delight of his fellow officers and their brave men. What did all this
                        victory mean to him? Hamilton to be treated as an honorable prisoner of war,
                        permitted to strut forth from the fort with his sword at his side, his head
                        upthe scalp-buyer, the murderer of Alice! What was patriotism to the crushed
                        heart of a lover? Even if his vision had been able to pierce the future and
                        realize the splendor of Anglo-Saxon civilization which was to follow that
                        little triumph at Vincennes, what pleasure could it have afforded him?
                        Alice, Alice, only Alice; no other thought had influence, save the recurring
                        surge of desire for vengeance upon her murderer.</p>
                    <p>And yet that night Beverley slept, and so forgot his despair for many hours;
                        even dreamed a pleasant dream <pb id="VAA2387-382" n="370"/> of home, where
                        his childhood was spent, of the stately old house on the breezy hill-top
                        overlooking a sunny plantation, with a little river lapsing and shimmering
                        through it. His mother&apos;s dear arms were around him, her loving
                        breath stirred his hair; and his stalwart, gray-headed father sat on the
                        veranda comfortably smoking his pipe, while away in the wide fields the
                        negroes sang at the plow and the hoe. Sweeter and sweeter grew the scene,
                        softer the air, tenderer the blending sounds of the water-murmur,
                        leaf-rustle, bird-song, and slave-song, until hand in hand he wandered with
                        Alice in greening groves, where the air was trembling with the ecstacy of
                        spring.</p>
                    <p>A young officer awoke him with an order from Clark to go on duty at once with
                        Captains Worthington and Williams, who, under Colonel Clark himself, were to
                        take possession of the fort. Mechanically he obeyed. The sun was far up,
                        shining between clouds of a leaden, watery hue, by the time everything was
                        ready for the important ceremony. Beside the main gate of the stockade two
                        companies of patriots under Bowman and McCarty were drawn up as guards,
                        while the British garrison filed out and was taken in charge. This bit of
                        formality ended, Governor Hamilton, attended by some of his officers, went
                        back into the fort and the gate was closed.</p>
                    <p>Clark now gave orders that preparations be made for hauling down the British
                        flag and hoisting the young banner of liberty in its place, when everything
                        should be ready for a salute of thirteen guns from the captured battery.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-383" n="371"/>
                    <p>Helm&apos;s round face was beaming. Plainly it showed that his happiness
                        was supreme. He dared not say anything, however; for Clark was now all
                        sternness and formality; it would be dangerous to take any liberties; but he
                        could smile and roll his quid of tobacco from cheek to cheek.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton and Farnsworth, the latter slightly wounded in the left arm, which
                        was bandaged, stood together somewhat apart from their fellow officers,
                        while preliminary steps for celebrating their defeat and capture were in
                        progress. They looked forlorn enough to have excited deep sympathy under
                        fairer conditions.</p>
                    <p>Outside the fort the creoles were beginning a noise of jubilation. The rumor
                        of what was going to be done had passed from mouth to mouth, until every
                        soul in the town knew and thrilled with expectancy. Men, women and children
                        came swarming to see the sight, and to hear at close range the crash of the
                        cannon. They shouted, in a scattering way at first, then the tumult grew
                        swiftly to a solid rolling tide that seemed beyond all comparison with the
                        population of Vincennes. Hamilton heard it, and trembled inwardly, afraid
                        lest the mob should prove too strong for the guard.</p>
                    <p>One leonine voice roared distinctly, high above the noise. It was a sound
                        familiar to all the creoles,that bellowing shout of Gaspard
                        Roussillon&apos;s. He was roaming around the stockade, having been
                        turned back by the guard when he tried to pass through the main gate.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-384" n="372"/>
                    <p>&quot;They shut me out!&quot; he bellowed furiously. &quot;I am
                        Gaspard Roussillon, and they shut me out, me! <hi rend="i">Ziff! me voici!
                            je vais entrer immdiatement, moi!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>He attracted but little attention, however; the people and the soldiery were
                        all too excited by the special interest of the occasion, and too busy with
                        making a racket of their own, for any individual, even the great Roussillon,
                        to gain their eyes or ears. He in turn scarcely heard the tumult they made,
                        so self-centered were his burning thoughts and feelings. A great occasion in
                        Vincennes and he, Gaspard Roussillon, not recognized as one of the large
                        factors in it! Ah, no, never! And he strode along the wall of the stockade,
                        turning the corners and heavily shambling over the inequalities till he
                        reached the postern. It was not fastened, some one having passed through
                        just before him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Ziff!</hi>&quot; he ejaculated, stepping into the
                        area and shaking himself after the manner of a dusty mastiff. &quot;<hi
                            rend="i">C&apos;est moi! Gaspard Roussillon!</hi>&quot; His
                        massive under jaw was set like that of a vise, yet it quivered with rage, a
                        rage which was more fiery condensation of self-approval than anger.</p>
                    <p>Outside the shouting, singing and huzzahs gathered strength and volume, until
                        the sound became a hoarse roar. Clark was uneasy; he had overheard much of a
                        threatening character during the siege. The creoles were, he knew, justly
                        exasperated, and even his own men had been showing a spirit which might
                        easily be fanned into a dangerous flame of vengeance. He was very anxious to
                        have the formalities of taking <pb id="VAA2387-385" n="373"/> possession of
                        the fort over with, so that he could the better control his forces. Sending
                        for Beverley he assigned him to the duty of hauling down the British flag
                        and running up that of Virginia. It was an honor of no doubtful sort, which
                        under different circumstances would have made the Lieutenant&apos;s
                        heart glow. As it was, he proceeded without any sense of pride or pleasure,
                        moving as a mere machine in performing an act significant beyond any other
                        done west of the mountains, in the great struggle for American independence
                        and the control of American territory.</p>
                    <p>Hamilton stood a little way from the foot of the tall flag-pole, his arms
                        folded on his breast, his chin slightly drawn in, his brows contracted,
                        gazing steadily at Beverley while he was untying the halyard, which had been
                        wound around the pole&apos;s base about three feet above the ground. The
                        American troops in the fort were disposed so as to form three sides of a
                        hollow square, facing inward. Oncle Jazon, serving as the ornamental extreme
                        of one line, was conspicuous for his outlandish garb and unmilitary bearing.
                        The silence inside the stockade offered a strong contrast to the tremendous
                        roar of voices outside. Clark made a signal, and at the tap of a drum,
                        Beverley shook the ropes loose and began to lower the British colors. Slowly
                        the bright emblem of earth&apos;s mightiest nation crept down in token
                        of the fact that a handful of back-woodsmen had won an empire by a splendid
                        stroke of pure heroism. Beverley detached the flag, and saluting, handed it
                        to Colonel Clark. Hamilton&apos;s breast heaved and his iron jaws
                        tightened their pressure <pb id="VAA2387-386" n="374"/> until the lines of
                        his cheeks were deep furrows of pain.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret, who had just been admitted, quietly took a place at one side
                        near the wall. There was a fine, warm, benignant smile on his old face, yet
                        his powerful shoulders drooped as if weighted down with a heavy load.
                        Hamilton was aware when he entered, and instantly the scene of their
                        conflict came into his memory with awful vividness, and he saw Alice lying
                        outstretched, stark and cold, the shining strand of hair fluttering across
                        her pallid cheek. Her ghost over-shadowed him.</p>
                    <p>Just then there was a bird-like movement, a wing-like rustle, and a light
                        figure flitted swiftly across the area. All eyes were turned upon it.
                        Hamilton recoiled, as pale as death, half lifting his hands, as if to ward
                        off a deadly blow, and then a gay flag was flung out over his head. He saw
                        before him the girl he had shot; but her beautiful face was not waxen now,
                        nor was it cold or lifeless. The rich red blood was strong under the
                        browned, yet delicate skin, the eyes were bright and brave, the cherry lips,
                        slightly apart, gave a glimpse of pearl white teeth, and the dimples,those
                        roguish dimples,twinkled sweetly.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Clark looked on in amazement, and in spite of himself, in admiration.
                        He did not understand; the sudden incident bewildered him; but his virile
                        nature was instantly and wholly charmed. Some-thing like a breath of violets
                        shook the tenderest chords of his heart.</p>
                    <p>Alice stood firmly, a statue of triumph, her right <pb id="VAA2387-387"
                            n="[]"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2387-6">
                            <p>Alice stood firmly, a statue of triumph, holding the flag p. 375.</p>
                        </figure>
                        <pb id="VAA2387-388" n="375"/> arm outstretched, holding the flag high above
                        Hamilton&apos;s head; and close by her side the little hunchback Jean
                        was posed in his most characteristic attitude, gazing at the banner which he
                        himself had stolen and kept hidden for Alice&apos;s sake, and because he
                        loved it.</p>
                    <p>There was a dead silence for some moments, during which Hamilton&apos;s
                        face showed that he was ready to collapse; then the keen voice of Oncle
                        Jazon broke forth:</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Vive Zhorzh Vasinton! Vive la bannire d&apos;Alice
                            Roussillon!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>He sprang to the middle of the area and flung his old cap high in air, with a
                        shrill war-whoop.</p>
                    <p>&quot;H&apos;ist it! h&apos;ist it! <hi rend="i">hissez la
                            bannire de Mademoiselle Alice Roussillon! Voil, que c&apos;est
                            glorieuse, cette bannier l!</hi>&quot; H&apos;ist it!
                        h&apos;ist it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was dancing with a rickety liveliness, his goatish legs and shriveled body
                        giving him the look of an emaciated satyr.</p>
                    <p>Clark had been told by some of his creole officers the story of how Alice
                        raised the flag when Helm took the fort, and how she snatched it from
                        Hamilton&apos;s hand, as it were, and would not give it up when he
                        demanded it. The whole situation pretty soon began to explain itself, as he
                        saw what Alice was doing. Then he heard her say to Hamilton, while she
                        slowly swayed the rippling flag back and forth:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I said, as you will remember, <hi rend="i">Monsieur le
                        Gouverneur</hi>, that when you next should see this flag, I should wave it
                        over your head. Well, look, I am waving it! <hi rend="i">Vive la rpublique!
                            Vive</hi> George Washington! <pb id="VAA2387-389" n="376"/> What do you
                        think of it, <hi rend="i">Monsieur le Gouverneur?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>The poor little hunchback Jean took off his cap and tossed it in rhythmical
                        emphasis, keeping time to her words.</p>
                    <p>And now from behind the hollow square came a mighty voice:</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;C&apos;est moi, Gaspard Roussillon; me voici,
                            messieurs!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>There was a spirit in the air which caught from Alice a thrill of romantic
                        energy. The men in the ranks and the officers in front of them felt a wave
                        of irresistible sympathy sweep through their hearts. Her picturesque beauty,
                        her fine temper, the fitness of the incident to the occasion, had an
                        instantaneous power which moved all men alike.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Raise her flag! Run up the young lady&apos;s flag!&quot;
                        some one shouted, and then every voice seemed to echo the words. Clark was a
                        young man of noble type, in whose veins throbbed the warm chivalrous blood
                        of the cavaliers. A waft of the suddenly prevailing influence bore him also
                        quite off his feet. He turned to Beverley and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do it! It will have a great effect. It is a good idea; get the
                        young lady&apos;s flag and her permission to run it up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Before he finished speaking, indeed at the first glance, he saw that
                        Beverley, like Hamilton, was white as a dead man; and at the same time it
                        came to his memory that his young friend had confided to him, <pb
                            id="VAA2387-390" n="377"/> during the awful march through the prairie
                        wilderness, a love-story about this very Alice Roussillon. In the worry and
                        stress of the subsequent struggle, he had forgotten the tender basis upon
                        which Beverley had rested his excuse for leaving Vincennes. Now it all
                        reappeared in justification of what was going on. It touched the romantic
                        core of his southern nature.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I say, Lieutenant Beverley,&quot; he repeated, &quot;beg
                        the young lady&apos;s permission to use her flag upon this glorious
                        occasion; or shall I do it for you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>There were no miracles in those brave days, and the strain of life with its
                        terrible realities braced all men and women to meet sudden explosions of
                        surprise, whether of good or bad effect, with admirable equipoise; but
                        Beverley&apos;s trial, it must be admitted, was extraordinary; still he
                        braced himself quickly and his whole expression changed when Clark moved to
                        go to Alice. For he realized now that it was, indeed, Alice in flesh and
                        blood, standing there, the center of admiration, filling the air with her
                        fine magnetism and crowning a great triumph with her beauty. He gave her a
                        glad, flashing smile, as if he had just discovered her, and walked straight
                        to her, his hands extended. She was not looking toward him; but she saw him
                        and turned to face him. Hers was the advantage; for she had known, for some
                        hours, of his presence in Vincennes, and had prepared herself to meet him
                        courageously and with maidenly reserve.</p>
                    <p>There is no safety, however, where Love lurks. Neither Beverley nor Alice was
                        as much agitated as <pb id="VAA2387-391" n="378"/> Hamilton, yet they both
                        forgot, what he remembered, that a hundred grim frontier soldiers were
                        looking on. Hamilton had his personal and official dignity to sustain, and
                        he fairly did it, under what a pressure of humiliating and surprising
                        circumstances we can fully comprehend. Not so with the two young people,
                        standing as it were in a suddenly bestowed and incomparable happiness, on
                        the verge of a new life, each to the other an unexpected, unhoped-for
                        resurrection from the dead. To them there was no universe save the
                        illimitable expanse of their love. In that moment of meeting, all that they
                        had suffered on account of love was transfused and poured forth,a glowing
                        libation for love&apos;s sake,a flood before which all barriers broke.</p>
                    <p>Father Beret was looking on with a strange fire in his eyes, and what he
                        feared would happen, did happen. Alice let the flag fall at
                        Hamilton&apos;s feet, when Beverley came near her smiling that great,
                        glad smile, and with a joyous cry leaped into his outstretched arms.</p>
                    <p>Jean snatched up the fallen banner and ran to Colonel Clark with it. Two
                        minutes later it was made fast and the halyard began to squeak through the
                        rude pulley at the top of the pole. Up, up, climbed the gay little emblem of
                        glory, while the cannon crashed from the embrasures of the blockhouse hard
                        by, and outside the roar of voices redoubled. Thirteen guns boomed the
                        salute, though it should have been fourteen,the additional one for the great
                        Northwestern Territory, that day annexed to the domain of the young American
                        Republic. The flag went up at old Vincennes <pb id="VAA2387-392" n="379"/>
                        never to come down again, and when it reached its place at the top of the
                        staff, Beverley and Alice stood side by side looking at it, while the sun
                        broke through the clouds and flashed on its shining folds, and love
                        unabashed glorified the two strong young faces.</p>

                    <p>History would be a very orderly affair, could the dry-as-dust historians have
                        their way, and doubtless it would be thrillingly romantic at every turn if
                        the novelists were able to control its current. Fortunately neither one nor
                        the other has much influence, and the result, in the long run, is that most
                        novels are shockingly tame, while the large body of history is loaded down
                        with picturesque incidents, which if used in fiction, would be thought
                        absurdly romantic and improbable.</p>
                    <p>Were our simple story of old Vincennes a mere fiction, we should hesitate to
                        bring in the explosion of a magazine at the fort with a view to sudden
                        confusion and, by that means, distracting attention from our heroine while
                        she betakes herself out of a situation which, although delightful enough for
                        a blessed minute, has quickly become an embarrassment quite unendurable. But
                        we simply adhere to the established facts in history. Owing to some
                        carelessness there was, indeed, an explosion of twenty-six six-pound
                        cartridges, which made a mighty roar and struck the newly installed garrison
                        into a heap, so to say, scattering things terribly and wounding six men,
                        among them Captains Bowman and Worthington.</p>
                    <p>After the thunderous crash came a momentary silence, which embraced both the
                        people within the fort <pb id="VAA2387-394" n="381"/> and the wild crowd
                        outside. Then the rush and noise were indescribable. Even Clark gave way to
                        excitement, losing command of himself and, of course, of his men. There was
                        a stampede toward the main gate by one wing of the troops in the hollow
                        square. They literally ran over Beverley and Alice, flinging them apart and
                        jostling them hither and yonder without mercy. Of course the turmoil quickly
                        subsided. Clark and Beverley got hold of themselves and sang out their
                        peremptory orders with excellent effect. It was like oil on raging water;
                        the men obeyed in a straggling way, getting back into ranks as best they
                        could.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Ventrebleu!&quot;</hi> squeaked Oncle Jazon,
                        &quot;ef I didn&apos;t think the ole world had busted into a million
                        pieces!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was jumping up and down not three feet from Beverley&apos;s toes,
                        waving his cap excitedly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But wasn&apos;t I skeert! Ya, ya, ya! <hi rend="i">Vive la
                            bannire d&apos;Alice Roussillon! Vive Zhorzh
                        Vasinton!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Hearing Alice&apos;s name caused Beverley to look around. Where was she?
                        In the distance he saw Father Beret hurrying to the spot where some of the
                        men burnt and wounded by the explosion were being stripped and cared for.
                        Hamilton still stood like a statue. He appeared to be the only cool person
                        in the fort.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is Alice?Miss Roussillonwhere did Miss Roussillon
                        go?&quot; Beverley exclaimed, staring around like a lost man.
                        &quot;Where is she?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;D&apos;know,&quot; said Oncle Jazon, resuming his habitual
                        expression of droll dignity, &quot;she shot apast me jes&apos; as
                            <pb id="VAA2387-395" n="382"/> thet thing busted loose, an&apos; she
                        went like er hummin&apos; bird, skitch!jes&apos; thet
                        wayan&apos; I didn&apos;t see &apos;r no more. &apos;Cause I
                        was skeert mighty nigh inter seven fits; &apos;spect that
                        &apos;splosion blowed her clean away! <hi rend="i">Ventrebleu!</hi>
                        never was so plum outen breath an&apos; dead crazy weak o&apos;
                        bein&apos; afeard!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lieutenant Beverley,&quot; roared Clark in his most commanding
                        tone, &quot;go to the gate and settle things there. That mob outside is
                        trying to break in!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The order was instantly obeyed, but Beverley had relapsed. Once more his soul
                        groped in darkness, while the whole of his life seemed unreal, a wavering,
                        misty, hollow dream. And yet his military duty was all real enough. He knew
                        just what to do when he reached the gate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Back there at once!&quot; he commanded, not loudly, but with
                        intense force, &quot;back there!&quot; This to the inward surging
                        wedge of excited outsiders. Then to the guard.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shoot the first man who crosses the line!&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Ziff! me voici! moi! Gaspard Roussillon. Laissez-moi
                            passer, messieurs.&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>A great body hurled itself frantically past Beverley and the guard, going out
                        through the gateway against the wall of the crowd, bearing everything before
                        it and shouting:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Back, fools! you&apos;ll all be killedthe powder is on fire!
                        Ziff! run!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Wild as a March hare, he bristled with terror and foamed at the mouth. He
                        stampeded the entire mass. There was a wild howl; a rush in the other
                        direction <pb id="VAA2387-396" n="383"/> followed, and soon enough the
                        esplanade and all the space back to the barricades and beyond were quite
                        deserted.</p>
                    <p>Alice was not aware that a serious accident had happened. Naturally she
                        thought the great, rattling, crashing noise of the explosion a mere part of
                        the spectacular show. When the rush followed, separating her and Beverley,
                        it was a great relief to her in some way; for a sudden recognition of the
                        boldness of her action in the little scene just ended, came over her and
                        bewildered her. An impulse sent her running away from the spot where, it
                        seemed to her, she had invited public derision. The terrible noises all
                        around her were, she now fancied, but the jeering and hooting of rude men
                        who had seen her unmaidenly forwardness.</p>
                    <p>With a burning face she flew to the postern and slipped out, once more taking
                        the course which had become so familiar to her feet. She did not slacken her
                        speed until she reached the Bourcier cabin, where she had made her home
                        since the night when Hamilton&apos;s pistol ball struck her. The little
                        domicile was quite empty of its household, but Alice entered and flung
                        herself into a chair, where she sat quivering and breathless when Adrienne,
                        also much excited, came in, preceded by a stream of <hi rend="i">patois</hi>
                        that sparkled continuously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The fort is blown up!&quot; she cried, gesticulating in every
                        direction at once, her petite figure comically dilated with the importance
                        of her statement. &quot;A hundred men are killed, and the powder is on
                        fire!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She pounced into Alice&apos;s arms, still talking as fast <pb
                            id="VAA2387-397" n="384"/> as her tongue could vibrate, changing from
                        subject to subject without rhyme or reason, her prattle making its way by
                        skips and shies until what was really uppermost in her sweet little heart
                        disclosed itself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And, O Alice! Ren has not come yet!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She plunged her dusky face between Alice&apos;s cheek and shoulder; Alice
                        hugged her sympathetically and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;But Ren will come, I know he will, dear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, but do you know it? is it true? who told you? when will he
                        come? where is he? tell me about him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her head popped up from her friend&apos;s neck and she smiled brilliantly
                        through the tears that were still sparkling on her long black lashes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t mean that I had heard from him, and I
                        don&apos;t know where he is; butbut they always come back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You say that because your manbecause Lieutenant Beverley has
                        returned. It is always so. You have everything to make you happy, while
                        II&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again her eyes spilled their shower, and she hid her face in her hands which
                        Alice tried in vain to remove.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t cry, Adrienne. You didn&apos;t see me
                        crying&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, of course not; you didn&apos;t have a thing to cry about.
                        Lieutenant Beverley told you just where he was going and just what&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But think, Adrienne, only think of the awful story they toldthat he
                        was killed, that Governor Hamilton had paid Long-Hair for killing him and
                        bringing back <pb id="VAA2387-398" n="385"/> his scalpoh dear, just think!
                        And I thought it was true.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I&apos;d be willing to think and believe anything in the
                        world, if Ren would come back,&quot; said Adrienne, her face, now
                        uncovered, showing pitiful lines of suffering. &quot;O Alice, Alice, and
                        he never, never will come!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice exhausted every device to cheer, encourage and comfort her. Adrienne
                        had been so good to her when she lay recovering from the shock of
                        Hamilton&apos;s pistol bullet, which, although it came near killing her,
                        made no serious woundonly a bruise, in fact. It was one of those fortunate
                        accidents, or providentially ordered interferences, which once in a while
                        save a life. The stone disc worn by Alice chanced to lie exactly in the
                        missile&apos;s way, and while it was not broken, the ball, already
                        somewhat checked by passing through several folds of Father Beret&apos;s
                        garments, flattened itself upon it with a shock which somehow struck Alice
                        senseless.</p>
                    <p>Here again, history in the form of an ancient family document (a letter
                        written in 1821 by Alice herself), gives us the curious brace of incidents,
                        to wit, the breaking of the miniature on Beverley&apos;s breast by a
                        British musket-ball, and the stopping of Hamilton&apos;s bullet over
                        Alice&apos;s heart by the Indian charm-stone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Which shows the goodness of God,&quot; the letter goes on,
                        &quot;and also seems to sustain the Indian legend concerning the stone,
                        that whoever might wear it could not be killed. Unquestionable (sic) Mr.
                        Hamilton&apos;s shot, which was aimed at poor, dear old Father Beret,
                        would have pierced my heart, but for that charm-stone. <pb id="VAA2387-399"
                            n="386"/> As for my locket, it did not, as some have reported, save
                        Fitzhugh&apos;s life when the musket-ball was stopped. The ball was so
                        spent that the blow was only hard enough to spoil temporary (sic) the face
                        of the miniature, which was afterwards restored fairly well by an artist in
                        Paris. When it did actually save Fitzhugh&apos;s life was out on the
                        Illinois plain. The savage, Long-Hair, peace to his memory, worked the
                        miracle of restoring to me&quot; Here a fold in the paper has destroyed
                        a line of the writing.</p>
                    <p>The letter is a sacred family paper, and there is not justification for going
                        farther into its faded and, in some parts, almost obliterated writing. But
                        so much may pass into these pages as a pleasant authentication of what
                        otherwise might be altogether too sweet a double nut for the
                        critic&apos;s teeth to crack.</p>
                    <p>While Adrienne and Alice were still discussing the probability of Ren de
                        Ronville&apos;s return, M. Roussillon came to the door. He was in search
                        of Madame, his wife, whom he had not yet seen.</p>
                    <p>He gathered the two girls in his mighty arms, tousling them with rough
                        tenderness. Alice returned his affectionate embrace and told him where to
                        find Madame Roussillon, who was with Dame Godre, probably at her house.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nobody killed,&quot; he said, in answer to Alice&apos;s
                        inquiry about the catastrophe at the fort. &quot;Some of &apos;em
                        hurt and burnt a little. Great big scare about nearly nothing. Ziff! my
                        children, you should have seen me quiet things. I put out my hands, this way
                            <pb id="VAA2387-400" n="387"/>
                        <hi rend="i">comme apouf!</hi> It was all over. The people went
                        home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His gestures indicated that he had borne back an army with open hands. Then
                        he chucked Adrienne under the chin with his finger and added in his softest
                        voice:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw somebody&apos;s lover the other day, over yonder in the
                        Indian village. He spoke to me about somebody<hi rend="i">eh, ma petite, que
                            voulez-vous dire?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Papa Roussillon! we were just talking about Ren!&quot;
                        cried Alice. &quot;Have you seen him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw you, you little minx, jumping into a man&apos;s arms
                        right under the eyes of a whole garrison! Bah! I could not believe it was my
                        little Alice!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He let go a grand guffaw, which seemed to shake the cabin&apos;s walls.
                        Alice blushed cherry red. Adrienne, too bashful to inquire about Ren, was
                        trembling with anxiety. The truth was not in Gaspard Roussillon, just then;
                        or if it was it stayed in him, for he had not seen Ren de Ronville. It was
                        his generous desire to please and to appear opulent of knowledge and
                        sympathy that made him speak. He knew what would please Adrienne, so why not
                        give her at least a delicious foretaste? Surely, when a thing was so cheap,
                        one need not be so parsimonious as to withhold a mere anticipation. He was
                        off before the girls could press him into details, for indeed he had none.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There now, what did I tell you?&quot; cried Alice, when the big
                        man was gone. &quot;I told you Ren would come. They always come
                        back!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret came in a little later. As soon as he <pb id="VAA2387-401"
                            n="388"/> saw Alice he frowned and began to shake his head; but she only
                        laughed, and imitating his hypocritical scowl, yet fringing it with a
                        twinkle of merry lines and dimples, pointed a taper finger at him and
                        exclaimed:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You bad, bad, man! why did you pretend to me that Lieutenant
                        Beverley was dead? What sinister ecclesiastical motive prompted you to
                        describe how Long-Hair scalped him? Ah, Father&quot;</p>
                    <p>The priest laid a broad hand over her saucy mouth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Something or other seems to have excited you mightily, <hi rend="i"
                            >ma fille,</hi> you are a trifle impulsively inclined to-day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, Father Beret; yes I know, and I am ashamed. My heart shrinks
                        when I think of what I did; but I was so glad, such a grand joy came all
                        over me when I saw him, so strong and brave and beautiful, coming toward me,
                        smiling that warm, glad smile and holding out his armsah, when I saw all
                        thatwhen I knew for sure that he was not deadI, why, FatherI just had to, I
                        couldn&apos;t help it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Father Beret laughed in spite of himself, but quickly managed to resume his
                        severe countenance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ta! ta!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;it was a bold thing for a
                        little girl to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So it was, so it was. But it was also a bold thing for him to doto
                        come back after he was dead and scalped and look so handsome and grand!
                        I&apos;m ashamed and sorry, Father; butbut, I&apos;m afraid I might
                        do it again ifwell, I don&apos;t care if I didso there, now!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-402" n="389"/>
                    <p>&quot;But what in the world are you talking about?&quot; interposed
                        Adrienne. Evidently they were discussing a most interesting matter of which
                        she knew nothing, and that did not suit her feminine curiosity.
                        &quot;Tell me.&quot; She pulled Father Beret&apos;s sleeve.
                        &quot;Tell me, I say!&quot;</p>
                    <p>It is probable that Father Beret would have pretended to betray
                        Alice&apos;s source of mingled delight and embarrassment, had not the
                        rest of the Bourcier household returned in time to break up the
                        conversation. A little later Alice gave Adrienne a vividly dramatic account
                        of the whole scene.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Ah, mon Dieu!&quot;</hi> exclaimed the petite
                        brunette, after she had heard the exciting story. &quot;That was just
                        like you, Alice. You always do superb things. You were born to do them. You
                        shoot Captain Farnsworth, you wound Lieutenant Barlow, you climb onto the
                        fort and set up your flagyou take it down again and run away with ityou get
                        shot and you do not dieyou kiss your lover right before a whole garrison!
                            <hi rend="i">Bon Dieu!</hi> if I could but do all those
                        things!&quot; She clasped her tiny hands before her and added rather
                        dejectedly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I couldn&apos;t, I couldn&apos;t. I couldn&apos;t
                        kiss a man in that way!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Late in the evening news came to Roussillon place, where Gaspard Roussillon
                        was once more happy in the midst of his little family, that the Indian
                        Long-Hair had just been brought to the fort, and would be shot on the
                        following day. A scouting party captured him as he approached the town,
                        bearing at his belt the fresh scalp of a white man. He would have been
                        killed <pb id="VAA2387-403" n="390"/> forthwith, but Clark, who wished to
                        avoid a repetition of the savage vengeance meted out to the Indians on the
                        previous day, had given strict orders that all prisoners should be brought
                        into the fort, where they were to have a fair trial by court martial.</p>
                    <p>Both Helm and Beverley were at Roussillon place, the former sipping wine and
                        chatting with Gaspard, the latter, of course, hovering around Alice, after
                        the manner of a hungry bee around a particularly sweet and deliciously
                        refractory flower. It was raining slowly, the fine drops coming straight
                        down through the cold, still February air; but the two young people found it
                        pleasant enough for them on the veranda, where they walked back and forth,
                        making fair exchange of the exciting experiences which had befallen them
                        during their long separation. Between the lines of these mutual recitals
                        sweet, fresh echoes of the old, old story went from heart to heart, an amban
                        love-bout like that of spring birds calling tenderly back and forth in the
                        blooming Maytime woods.</p>
                    <p>Both Captain Helm and M. Roussillon were delighted to hear of
                        Long-Hair&apos;s capture and certain fate, but neither of them regarded
                        the news as of sufficient importance to need much comment. They did not
                        think of telling Beverley and Alice. Jean, however, lying awake in his
                        little bed, overheard the conversation, which he repeated to Alice next
                        morning with great circumstantiality.</p>
                    <p>Having the quick insight bred of frontier experience, Alice instantly caught
                        the terrible significance of the dilemma in which she and Beverley would be
                        placed <pb id="VAA2387-404" n="391"/> by Long-Hair&apos;s situation.
                        Moreover, something in her heart arose with irresistible power demanding the
                        final, the absolute human sympathy and gratitude. No matter what deeds
                        Long-Hair had committed that were evil beyond forgiveness, he had done for
                        her the all-atoning thing. He had saved Beverley and sent him back to her.</p>
                    <p>With a start and a chill of dread, she thought: &quot;What if it is
                        already too late!&quot;</p>
                    <p>But her nature could not hesitate. To feel the demand of an exigency was to
                        act. She snatched a wrap from its peg on the wall and ran as fast as she
                        could to the fort. People who met her flying along wondered, staring after
                        her, what could be urging her so that she saw nobody, checked herself for
                        nothing, ran splashing through the puddles in the street, gazing ahead of
                        her, as if pursuing some flying object from which she dared not turn her
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>And there was, indeed, a call for her utmost power of flight, if she would be
                        of any assistance to Long-Hair, who even then stood bound to a stake in the
                        fort&apos;s area, while a platoon of riflemen, those unerring shots from
                        Kentucky and Virginia, were ready to make a target of him at a range of but
                        twenty yards.</p>
                    <p>Beverley, greatly handicapped by the fact that the fresh scalp of a white man
                        hung at Long-Hair&apos;s belt, had exhausted every possible argument to
                        avert or mitigate the sentence promptly spoken by the court martial of which
                        Colonel Clark was the ruling spirit. He had succeeded barely to the extent
                        of turning the mode of execution from tomahawking to shooting. <pb
                            id="VAA2387-405" n="392"/> All the officers in the fort approved killing
                        the prisoner, and it was difficult for Colonel Clark to prevent the men from
                        making outrageous assaults upon him, so exasperated were they at sight of
                        the scalp.</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon proved to be one of the most refractory among those who demanded
                        tomahawking and scalping as the only treatment due Long-Hair. The repulsive
                        savage stood up before them stolid, resolute, defiant, proudly flaunting the
                        badge which testified to his horrible efficiency as an emissary of
                        Hamilton&apos;s. It had been left in his belt by Clark&apos;s order,
                        as the best justification of his doom.</p>
                    <p>&quot;L&apos; me hack &apos;is damned head,&quot; Oncle Jazon
                        pleaded. &quot;I jes&apos; hankers to chop a hole inter it.
                        An&apos; besides I want &apos;is scelp to hang up wi&apos; mine
                        an&apos; that&apos;n o&apos; the Injun what scelped me. He
                        kicked me in the ribs, the stinkin&apos; varmint.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley pleaded eloquently and well, but even the genial Major Helm laughed
                        at his sentiment of gratitude to a savage who at best but relented at the
                        last moment, for Alice&apos;s sake, and concluded not to sell him to
                        Hamilton. It is due to the British commander to record here that he most
                        positively and with what appeared to be high sincerity, denied the charge of
                        having offered rewards for the taking of human scalps. He declared that his
                        purposes and practices were humane, and that while he did use the Indians as
                        military allies, his orders to them were that they must forego cruel modes
                        of warfare and refrain from savage outrage upon prisoners. Certainly the
                        weight of contemporary testimony seems overwhelmingly against <pb
                            id="VAA2387-406" n="393"/> him, but we enter his denial. Long-Hair
                        himself, however, taunted him with accusations of unfaithfulness in carrying
                        out some very inhuman contracts, and to add a terrible sting, volunteered
                        the statement that poor Barlow&apos;s scalp had served his turn in the
                        place of Beverley&apos;s.</p>
                    <p>With conditions so hideous to contend against, Beverley, of course, had no
                        possible means of succoring the condemned savage.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Him a kickin&apos; yer ribs clean inter ye, an&apos; a
                        makin&apos; ye run the ga&apos;ntlet, an&apos; here ye air a
                        tryin&apos; to save &apos;is life!&quot; whined Oncle Jazon.
                        &quot;W&apos;y man, I thought ye hed some senterments! Dast
                        &apos;is Injin liver, I kin feel them kicks what he guv me till yit. <hi
                            rend="i">Ventrebleu! que diable voulez-vous?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Clark simply pushed Beverley&apos;s pleadings aside as not worth a
                        moment&apos;s consideration. He easily felt the fine bit of gratitude at
                        the bottom of it all; but there was too much in the other side of the
                        balance; justice, the discipline and confidence of his little army, and the
                        claim of the women and children on the frontier demanded firmness in dealing
                        with a case like Long-Hair&apos;s.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, no,&quot; he said to Beverley, &quot;I would do
                        anything in the world for you, Fitz, except to swerve an inch from duty to
                        my country and the defenceless people down yonder in Kentucky. I
                        can&apos;t do it. There&apos;s no use to press the matter further.
                        The die is cast. That brute&apos;s got to be killed, and killed dead.
                        Look at himlook at that scalp! I&apos;d have him killed if I dropped
                        dead for it the next instant.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-407" n="394"/>
                    <p>Beverley shuddered. The argument was horribly convincing, and yet, somehow,
                        the desire to save Long-Hair overbore everything else in his mind. He could
                        not cease his efforts; it seemed to him as if he were pleading for Alice
                        herself. Captain Farnsworth, strange to say, was the only man in the fort
                        who leaned to Beverley&apos;s side; but he was reticent, doubtless
                        feeling that his position as a British prisoner gave him no right to speak,
                        especially when every lip around him was muttering something about
                        &quot;infamous scalp-buy-ers and Indian partisans,&quot; with whom
                        he was prominently counted by the speakers.</p>
                    <p>As Clark had said, the die was cast. Long-Hair, bound to a stake, the scalp
                        still dangling at his side, grimly faced his executioners, who were eager to
                        fire. He appeared to be proud of the fact that he was going to be killed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One thing I can say of him,&quot; Helm remarked to Beverley;
                        &quot;he&apos;s the grandest specimen of the animalI might say the
                        bruteman that I ever saw, red, white or black. Just look at his body and
                        limbs! Those muscles are perfectly marvelous.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He saved my life, and I must stand here and see him
                        murdered,&quot; the young man replied with intense bitterness. It was
                        all that he could think, all that he could say. He felt inefficient and
                        dejected, almost desperate.</p>
                    <p>Clark himself, not willing to cast responsibility upon a subordinate, made
                        ready to give the fatal order. Turning to Long-Hair first, he demanded of
                        him as well as he could in the Indian dialect of which he had <pb
                            id="VAA2387-408" n="395"/> a smattering, what he had to say at his last
                        moment.</p>
                    <p>The Indian straightened his already upright form, and, by a strong bulging of
                        his muscles, snapped the thongs that bound him. Evidently he had not tried
                        thus to free himself; it was rather a spasmodic expression of savage dignity
                        and pride. One arm and both his legs still were partially confined by the
                        bonds, but his right hand he lifted, with a gesture of immense
                        self-satisfaction, and pointed at Hamilton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indian brave; white man coward,&quot; he said, scowling
                        scornfully. &quot;Long-Hair tell truth; white man lie, damn!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hamilton&apos;s countenance did not change its calm, cold expression.
                        Long-Hair gazed at him fixedly for a long moment, his eyes flashing most
                        concentrated hate and contempt. Then he tore the scalp from his belt and
                        flung it with great force straight toward the captive Governor&apos;s
                        face. It fell short, but the look that went with it did not, and Hamilton
                        recoiled.</p>
                    <p>At that moment Alice arrived. Her coming was just in time to interrupt Clark,
                        who had turned to the waiting platoon with the order of death on his lips.
                        She made no noise, save the fluttering of her skirts, and her loud and rapid
                        panting on account of her long, hard run. She sprang before Long-Hair and
                        faced the platoon.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You cannot, you shall not kill this man!&quot; she cried in a
                        voice loaded with excitement. &quot;Put away those guns!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Woman never looked more thrillingly beautiful to man than she did just then
                        to all those rough, stern <pb id="VAA2387-409" n="396"/> backwoodsmen.
                        During her flight her hair had fallen down, and it glimmered like soft
                        sunlight around her face. Something compelling flashed out of her eyes, an
                        expression between a triumphant smile and a ray of irresistible beseechment.
                        It took Colonel Clark&apos;s breath when he turned and saw her standing
                        there, and heard her words.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This man saved Lieutenant Beverley&apos;s life,&quot; she
                        presently added, getting better control of her voice, and sending into it a
                        thrilling <hi rend="i">timbre;</hi> &quot;you shall not harm himyou must
                        not do it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beverley was astounded when he saw her, the thing was so unexpected, so
                        daring, and done with such high, imperious force; still it was but a
                        realization of what he had imagined she would be upon occasion. He stood
                        gazing at her, as did all the rest, while she faced Clark and the platoon of
                        riflemen. To hear his own name pass her quivering lips, in that tone and in
                        that connection, seemed to him a consecration.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would you be more savage than your Indian prisoner?&quot; she
                        went on, &quot;less grateful than he for a life saved? I did him a
                        small, a very small, service once, and in memory of that he saved Lieutenant
                        Beverley&apos;s life, becausebecause&quot; she faltered for a single
                        breath, then added clearly and with magnetic sweetness&quot;because
                        Lieutenant Beverley loved me, and because I loved him. This Indian Long-Hair
                        showed a gratitude that could overcome his strongest passion. You white men
                        should be ashamed to fall below his standard.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her words went home. It was as if the beauty of her <pb id="VAA2387-410"
                            n="397"/> face, the magnetism of her lissome and symmetrical form, the
                        sweet fire of her eyes and the passionate appeal of her voice gave what she
                        said a new and irresistible force of truth. When she spoke of
                        Beverley&apos;s love for her, and declared her love for him, there was
                        not a manly heart in all the garrison that did not suddenly beat quicker and
                        feel a strange, sweet waft of tenderness. A mother, somewhere, a wife, a
                        daughter, a sister, a sweetheart, called through that voice of absolute
                        womanhood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Beverley, what can I do?&quot; muttered Clark, his bronze face
                        as pale as it could possibly become.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do!&quot; thundered Beverley, &quot;do! you cannot murder
                        that man. Hamilton is the man you should shoot! He offered large rewards, he
                        inflamed the passions and fed the love of rum and the cupidity of poor wild
                        men like the one standing yonder. Yet you take him prisoner and treat him
                        with distinguished consideration. Hamilton offered a large sum for me taken
                        alive, a smaller one for my scalp. Long-Hair saved me. You let Hamilton
                        stand yonder in perfect safety while you shoot the Indian. Shame on you,
                        Colonel Clark! shame on you, if you do it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Alice stood looking at the stalwart commander while Beverley was pouring
                        forth his torrent of scathing reference to Hamilton, and she quickly saw
                        that Clark was moved. The moment was ripe for the finishing stroke. They say
                        it is genius that avails itself of opportunity. Beverley knew the fight was
                        won when he saw what followed. Alice suddenly left Long-Hair and ran to
                        Colonel Clark, who felt her warm, strong <pb id="VAA2387-411" n="398"/> arms
                        loop round him for a single point of time never to be effaced from his
                        memory; then he saw her kneeling at his feet, her hands upstretched, her
                        face a glorious prayer, while she pleaded the Indian&apos;s cause and
                        won it.</p>
                    <p>Doubtless, while we all rather feel that Clark was weak to be thus swayed by
                        a girl, we cannot quite blame him. Alice&apos;s flag was over him; he
                        had heard her history from Beverley&apos;s cunning lips; he actually
                        believed that Hamilton was the real culprit, and besides he felt not a
                        little nauseated with executing Indians. A good excuse to have an end of it
                        all did not go begging.</p>
                    <p>But Long-Hair was barely gone over the horizon from the fort, as free and as
                        villainous a savage as ever trod the earth, when a discovery made by Oncle
                        Jazon caused Clark to hate himself for what he had done.</p>
                    <p>The old scout picked up the scalp, which Long-Hair had flung at Hamilton, and
                        examined it with odious curiosity. He had lingered on the spot with no other
                        purpose than to get possession of that ghastly relic. Since losing his own
                        scalp the subject of crown-locks had grown upon his mind until its
                        fascination was irresistible. He studied the hair of every person he saw, as
                        a physiognomist studies faces. He held the gruesome thing up before him,
                        scrutinizing it with the expression of a connoisseur who has discovered, on
                        a grimy canvas, the signature of an old master.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Sac&apos; bleu!&quot;</hi> he presently broke
                        forth. &quot;Well I&apos;ll be Look&apos;ee yer, George Clark!
                        Come yer an&apos; <pb id="VAA2387-412" n="399"/> look. Ye&apos;ve
                        been sold ag&apos;in. Take a squint, ef ye please!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Colonel Clark, with his hands crossed behind him, his face thoughtfully
                        contracted, was walking slowly to and fro a little way off. He turned about
                        when Oncle Jazon spoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What now, Jazon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A mighty heap right now, that&apos;s what; come yer
                        an&apos; let me show ye. Yer a fine sort o&apos; eejit, now
                        ain&apos;t ye!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The two men walked toward each other and met. Oncle Jazon held up the scalp
                        with one hand, pointing at it with the index finger of the other.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This here scalp come off&apos;n Ren de Ronville&apos;s
                        head.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And who is he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who&apos;s he? Ye may well ax thet. He wuz a Frenchman. He wuz
                        a fine young feller o&apos; this town. He killed a Corp&apos;ral
                        o&apos; Hamilton&apos;s an&apos; tuck ter the woods a month or
                        two ago. Hamilton offered a lot o&apos; money for &apos;im or
                        &apos;is scalp, an&apos; Long-Hair went in fer gittin&apos; it.
                        Now ye knows the whole racket. An&apos; ye lets that Injun go.
                        An&apos; thet same Injun he mighty nigh kicked my ribs inter my
                        stomach!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon&apos;s feelings were visible and audible; but Clark could not
                        resent the contempt of the old man&apos;s looks and words. He felt that
                        he deserved far more than he was receiving. Nor was Oncle Jazon wrong. Ren
                        de Ronville never came back to little Adrienne Bourcier, although, being
                        kept entirely ignorant of her lover&apos;s fate, she waited and dreamed
                        and hoped <pb id="VAA2387-413" n="400"/> throughout more than two years,
                        after which there is no further record of her life.</p>
                    <p>Clark, Beverley and Oncle Jazon consulted together and agreed among
                        themselves that they would hold profoundly secret the story of the scalp. To
                        have made it public would have exasperated the creoles and set them
                        violently against Clark, a thing heavy with disaster for all his future
                        plans. As it was, the release of Long-Hair caused a great deal of
                        dissatisfaction and mutinous talk. Even Beverley now felt that the execution
                        ordered by the commander ought to have been sternly carried out.</p>
                    <p>A day or two later, however, the whole dark affair was closed forever by a
                        bit of confidence on the part of Oncle Jazon when Beverley dropped into his
                        hut one evening to have a smoke with him.</p>
                    <p>The rain was over, the sky shone like one vast luminary, with a nearly full
                        moon and a thousand stars reinforcing it. Up from the south poured one of
                        those balmy, accidental wind floods, sometimes due in February on the
                        Wabash, full of tropical dream-hints, yet edged with a winter chill that
                        smacks of treachery. Oncle Jazon was unusually talkative; he may have had a
                        deep draught of liquor; at all events Beverley had little room for a word.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, bein&apos; as it&apos;s twixt us, as is bosom
                        frien&apos;s,&quot; the old fellow presently said,
                        &quot;I&apos;ll jes&apos; show ye somepin poorty.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He pricked the wick of a lamp and took down his bunch of scalps.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-414" n="401"/>
                    <p>&quot;I hev been a addin&apos; one more to keep company o&apos;
                        mine an&apos; the tothers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He separated the latest acquisition from the rest of the wisp and added, with
                        a heinous chuckle:</p>
                    <p>&quot;This&apos;n &apos;s Long-Hair&apos;s!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And so it was. Beverley knocked the ashes from his pipe and rose to go.</p>
                    <p>&quot;W&apos;en they kicks yer Oncle Jazon&apos;s ribs,&quot;
                        the old man added, &quot;they&apos;d jes&apos; as well lay down
                        an&apos; give up, for he&apos;s goin&apos; to salervate
                        &apos;em.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then, after Beverley had passed out of the cabin, Oncle Jazon chirruped after
                        him:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mebbe ye&apos;d better not tell leetle Alice. The pore leetle
                        gal hev hed worry &apos;nough.&quot;</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">CLARK ADVISES ALICE</head>
                    <p>A few days after the surrender of Hamilton, a large boat, the <hi rend="i"
                            >Willing,</hi> arrived from Kaskaskia. It was well manned and heavily
                        armed. Clark fitted it out before beginning his march and expected it to be
                        of great assistance to him in the reduction of the fort, but the high waters
                        and the floating driftwood delayed its progress, so that its disappointed
                        crew saw Alice&apos;s flag floating bright and high when their eyes
                        first looked upon the dull little town from far down the swollen river.
                        There was much rejoicing, however, when they came ashore and were
                        enthusiastically greeted by the garrison and populace. A courier whom they
                        picked up on the Ohio came with them. He bore dispatches from Governor Henry
                        of Virginia to Clark and a letter for Beverley from his father. With them
                        appeared also Simon Kenton, greatly to the delight of Oncle Jazon, who had
                        worried much about his friend since their latest <hi rend="i"
                        >fredaine</hi>as he called itwith the Indians. Meantime an expedition under
                        Captain Helm had been sent up the river with the purpose of capturing a
                        British flotilla from Detroit.</p>
                    <p>Gaspard Roussillon, immediately after Clark&apos;s victory, thought he
                        saw a good opening favorable to festivity at the river house, for which he
                        soon began to make some of his most ostentatious preparations. Fate,
                        however, as usual in his case, interfered. Fate <pb id="VAA2387-416" n="403"
                        /> seemed to like pulling the big Frenchman&apos;s ear now and again, as
                        if to remind him of the factwhich he was apt to forgetthat he lacked
                        somewhat of omnipotence.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Ziff! Je vais donner un banquet tout le monde,
                            moi!&quot;</hi> he cried, hustling and bustling hither and thither.</p>
                    <p>A scout from up the river announced the approach of Philip Dejean with his
                        flotilla richly laden, and what little interest may have been gathering in
                        the direction of M. Roussillon&apos;s festal proposition vanished like
                        the flame of a lamp in a puff of wind when this news reached Colonel Clark
                        and became known in the town.</p>
                    <p>Beverley and Alice sat together in the main room of the Roussillon cabinyou
                        could scarcely find them separated during those happy daysand Alice was
                        singing to the soft tinkle of a guitar, a creole ditty with a merry smack in
                        its scarcely intelligible nonsense. She knew nothing about music beyond what
                        M. Roussillon, a jack of all trades, had been able to teach her,a few simple
                        chords to accompany her songs, picked up at hap-hazard. But her voice, like
                        her face and form, irradiated witchery. It was sweet, firm, deep, with
                        something haunting in itthe tone of a hermit thrush, marvelously pure and
                        clear, carried through a gay strain like the mocking-bird&apos;s. Of
                        course Beverley thought it divine; and when a message came from Colonel
                        Clark bidding him report for duty at once, he felt an impulse toward mutiny
                        of the rankest sort. He did not dream that a military <pb id="VAA2387-417"
                            n="404"/> expedition could be on hand; but upon reaching headquarters,
                        the first thing he heard was:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Report to Captain Helm. You are to go with him up the river and
                        intercept a British force. Move lively, Helm is waiting for you,
                        probably.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was no time for explanations. Evidently Clark expected neither
                        questions nor delay. Beverley&apos;s love of adventure and his patriotic
                        desire to serve his country came to his aid vigorously enough; still, with
                        Alice&apos;s love-song ringing in his heart, there was a cord pulling
                        him back from duty to the sweetest of all life&apos;s joys.</p>
                    <p>Helm was already at the landing, where a little fleet of boats was being
                        prepared. A thousand things had to be done in short order. All hands were
                        stimulated to highest exertion with the thought of another fight. Swivels
                        were mounted in boats, ammunition and provisions stored abundantly, flags
                        hoisted and oars dipped. Never was an expedition of so great importance more
                        swiftly organized and set in motion, nor did one ever have a more prosperous
                        voyage or completer triumph. Philip Dejean, Justice of Detroit, with his
                        men, boats and rich cargo, was captured easily, with not a shot fired, nor a
                        drop of blood spilled in doing it.</p>
                    <p>If Alice could have known all this before it happened, she would probably
                        have saved herself from the mortification of a rebuke administered very
                        kindly, but not the less thoroughly, by Colonel Clark.</p>
                    <p>The rumor came to hera brilliant creole rumor, duly inflatedthat an
                        overwhelming British force was descending the river, and that Beverley with
                        a few <pb id="VAA2387-418" n="405"/> men, not sufficient to base the
                        expedition on a respectable forlorn hope, would be sent to meet them. Her
                        nature, as was its wont, flared into high indignation. What right had
                        Colonel Clark to send her lover away to be killed just at the time when he
                        was all the whole world to her? Nothing could be more outrageous. She would
                        not suffer it to be done; not she!</p>
                    <p>Colonel Clark greeted her pleasantly, when she came somewhat abruptly to him,
                        where he was directing a squad of men at work making some repairs in the
                        picketing of the fort. He did not observe her excitement until she began to
                        speak, and then it was noticeable only, and not very strongly, in her tone.
                        She forgot to speak English, and her French was Greek to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am glad to see you, Mademoiselle,&quot; he said, rather
                        inconsequently, lifting his hat and bowing with rough grace, while he
                        extended his right hand cordially. &quot;You have something to say to
                        me? Come with me to my office.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She barely touched his fingers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I have something to say to you. I can tell it here,&quot;
                        she said, speaking English now with softest creole accent. &quot;I
                        wantedI came to&quot; It was not so easy as she had imagined it would be
                        to utter what she had in mind. Clark&apos;s steadfast, inscrutable eyes,
                        kindly yet not altogether sympathetic, met her own and beat them down. Her
                        voice failed.</p>
                    <p>He offered her his arm and gravely said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;We will go to my office. I see that you have some important
                        communication to make. There are too many ears here.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-419" n="406"/>
                    <p>Of a sudden she felt like running home. Somehow the situation broke upon her
                        with a most embarrassing effect. She did not take Clark&apos;s arm, and
                        she began to tremble. He appeared unconscious of this, and probably was, for
                        his mind had a fine tangle of great schemes in it just then; but he turned
                        toward his office, and bidding her follow him, walked away in that
                        direction.</p>
                    <p>She was helpless. Not the slightest trace of her usual brilliant
                        self-assertion was at her command. Saving the squad of men sawing and
                        hacking, digging and hammering, the fort appeared as deserted as her mind.
                        She stood gazing after Clark. He did not look back, but strode right on. If
                        she would speak with him, she must follow. It was a surprise to her, for
                        heretofore she had always had her own way, even if she found it necessary to
                        use force. And where was Beverley? Where was the garrison? Colonel Clark did
                        not seem to be at all concerned about the approach of the Britishand yet
                        those repairsperhaps he was making ready for a desperate resistance! She did
                        not move until he reached the door of his office where he stopped and
                        stepped aside, as if to let her pass in first; he even lifted his hat, then
                        looked a trifle surprised when he saw that she was not near him, frowned
                        slightly, changed the frown to a smile and said, lifting his voice so that
                        she felt a certain imperative meaning in it:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did I walk too fast for you? I beg your pardon,
                        Mademoiselle.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-420" n="407"/>
                    <p>He stood waiting for her, as a father waits for a lagging, wilful child.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come, please,&quot; he added, &quot;if you have something
                        to say to me; my time just now is preciousI have a great deal to
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was not of a nature to retreat under fire, and yet the panic in her
                        breast came very near mastering her will. Clark saw a look in her face which
                        made him speak again:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I assure you, Mademoiselle, that you need not feel embarrassed. You
                        can rely upon me to&quot;</p>
                    <p>She made a gesture that interrupted him; at the same time she almost ran
                        toward him, gathering in breath, as one does who is about to force out a
                        desperately resisting and riotous thought. The strong, grave man looked at
                        her with a full sense of her fascination, and at the same time he felt a
                        vague wish to get away from her, as if she were about to cast unwelcome
                        responsibility upon him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is Lieutenant Beverley?&quot; she demanded, now close to
                        Clark, face to face, and gazing straight into his eyes. &quot;I want to
                        see him.&quot; Her tone suggested intensest excitement. She was
                        trembling visibly.</p>
                    <p>Clark&apos;s face changed its expression. He suddenly recalled to mind
                        Alice&apos;s rapturous public greeting of Beverley on the day of the
                        surrender. He was a cavalier, and it did not agree with his sense of high
                        propriety for girls to kiss their lovers out in the open air before a gazing
                        army. True enough, he himself had been hoodwinked by Alice&apos;s beauty
                        and boldness in <pb id="VAA2387-421" n="408"/> the matter of Long-Hair. He
                        confessed this to himself mentally, which may have strengthened his present
                        disapproval of her personal inquiry about Beverley. At all events he thought
                        she ought not to be coming into the stockade on such an errand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lieutenant Beverley is absent acting under my orders,&quot; he
                        said, with perfect respectfulness, yet in a tone suggesting military
                        finality. He meant to set an indefinite yet effective rebuke in his words.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Absent?&quot; she echoed. &quot;Gone? You sent him away to
                        be killed! You had no rightyou&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Roussillon,&quot; said Clark, becoming almost stern,
                        &quot;you had better go home and stay there; young girls
                        oughtn&apos;t to run around hunting men in places like this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His blunt severity of speech was accompanied by a slight frown and a gesture
                        of impatience.</p>
                    <p>Alice&apos;s face blazed red to the roots of her sunny hair; the color
                        ebbed, giving place to a pallor like death. She began to tremble, and her
                        lips quivered pitifully, but she braced herself and tried to force back the
                        choking sensation in her throat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must not misconstrue my words,&quot; Clark quickly added;
                        &quot;I simply mean that men will not rightly understand you. They will
                        form impressions very harmful to you. Even Lieutenant Beverley might not see
                        you in the right light.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whatwhat do you mean?&quot; she gasped, shrinking from him, a
                        burning spot reappearing under the dimpled skin of each cheek.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pray, Miss, do not get excited. There is nothing <pb
                            id="VAA2387-422" n="409"/> to make you cry.&quot; He saw tears
                        shining in her eyes. &quot;Beverley is not in the slightest danger. All
                        will be well, and he&apos;ll come back in a few days. The expedition
                        will be but a pleasure trip. Now you go home. Lieutenant Beverley is amply
                        able to take care of himself. And let me tell you, if you expect a good man
                        to have great confidence in you, stay home and let him hunt you up instead
                        of you hunting him. A man likes that better.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It would be impossible to describe Alice&apos;s feelings, as they just
                        then rose like a whirling storm in her heart. She was humiliated, she was
                        indignant, she was abashed; she wanted to break forth with a tempest of
                        denial, self-vindication, resentment; she wanted to cry with her face hidden
                        in her hands. What she did was to stand helplessly gazing at Clark, with two
                        or three bright tears on either cheek, her hands clenched, her eyes
                        flashing. She was going to say some wild thing; but she did not; her voice
                        lodged fast in her throat. She moved her lips, unable to make a sound.</p>
                    <p>Two of Clark&apos;s officers relieved the situation by coming up to get
                        orders about some matter of town government, and Alice scarcely knew how she
                        made her way home. Every vein in her body was humming like a bee when she
                        entered the house and flung herself into a chair.</p>
                    <p>She heard Madame Roussillon and Father Beret chatting in the kitchen, whence
                        came a fragrance of broiling buffalo steak besprinkled with garlic. It was
                        Father Beret&apos;s favorite dish, wherefore his tongue ran freelyalmost
                        as freely as that of his hostess, <pb id="VAA2387-423" n="410"/> and when he
                        heard Alice come in, he called gayly to her through the kitchen door:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come here, <hi rend="i">ma fille,</hi> and lend us old folks your
                        appetite; <hi rend="i">nous avons une tranche la Bordelaise!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not hungry,&quot; she managed to say, &quot;you can
                        eat it without me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man&apos;s quick ears caught the quaver of trouble in her voice,
                        much as she tried to hide it. A moment later he was standing beside her with
                        his hand on her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is the matter now, little one?&quot; he tenderly demanded.
                        &quot;Tell your old Father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She began to cry, laying her face in her crossed arms, the tears gushing, her
                        whole frame aquiver, and heaving great sobs. She seemed to shrink like a
                        trodden flower. It touched Father Beret deeply.</p>
                    <p>He suspected that Beverley&apos;s departure might be the cause of her
                        trouble; but when presently she told him what had taken place in the fort,
                        he shook his head gravely and frowned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Colonel Clark was right, my daughter,&quot; he said after a
                        short silence, &quot;and it is time for you to ponder well upon the
                        significance of his words. You can&apos;t always be a wilful, headstrong
                        little girl, running everywhere and doing just as you please. You have grown
                        to be a woman in statureyou must be one in fact. You know I told you at
                        first to be careful how you acted with&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father, dear old Father!&quot; she cried, springing from her
                        seat and throwing her arms around his neck. &quot;Have <pb
                            id="VAA2387-424" n="411"/> I appeared forward and unwomanly? Tell me,
                        Father, tell me! I did not mean to do anything&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Quietly, my child, don&apos;t give way to excitement.&quot;
                        He gently put her from him and crossed himselfa habit of his when suddenly
                        perplexedthen added:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have done no evil; but there are proprieties which a young
                        woman must not overstep. You are impulsive, too impulsive; and it will not
                        do to let a young man see that youthat you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father, I understand,&quot; she interrupted, and her face grew
                        very pale.</p>
                    <p>Madame Roussillon came to the door, flushed with stooping over the fire, and
                        announced that the steak was ready.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bring the wine, Alice,&quot; she added, &quot;a bottle of
                        Bordeaux.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She stood for a breath or two, her red hands on her hips, looking first at
                        Father Beret, then at Alice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Quarreling again about the romances?&quot; she inquired.
                        &quot;She&apos;s been at it again?she&apos;s found &apos;em
                        again?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Father Beret, with a queer, dry smile,
                        &quot;more romance. Yes, she&apos;s been at it again! Now fetch the
                        Bordeaux, little one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The following days were cycles of torture to Alice. She groveled in the
                        shadow of a great dread. It seemed to her that Beverley could not love her,
                        could not help looking upon her as a poor, wild, foolish girl, unworthy of
                        consideration. She magnified her faults and crudities, she paraded before
                        her inner vision her recent improprieties, as they had been disclosed to
                        her, <pb id="VAA2387-425" n="412"/> until she saw herself a sort of
                        monstrosity at which all mankind was gazing with disgust. Life seemed dry
                        and shriveled, a mere jaundiced shadow, while her love for Beverley took on
                        a new growth, luxuriant, all-embracing, uncontrollable. The ferment of
                        spirit going on in her breast was the inevitable process of self-recognition
                        which follows the terrible unfolding of the passion-flower, in a nature
                        almost absolutely simple and unsophisticated.</p>
                    <p>Vincennes held its breath while waiting for news from Helm&apos;s
                        expedition. Every day had its nimble, yet wholly imaginary account of what
                        had happened, skipping from mouth to mouth, and from cabin to cabin. The
                        French folk ran hither and thither in the persistent rain, industriously
                        improving the dramatic interest of each groundless report. Alice&apos;s
                        disturbed imagination reveled in the kaleidoscopic terrors conjured up by
                        these swift changes of the form and color of the stories &quot;from the
                        front,&quot; all of them more or less tragic. To-day the party is
                        reported as having been surprised and massacred to a manto-morrow there has
                        been a great fight, many killed, the result in doubtnext day the British are
                        defeated, and so on. The volatile spirit of the creoles fairly surpassed
                        itself in ringing the changes on stirring rumors.</p>
                    <p>Alice scarcely left the house during the whole period of excitement and
                        suspense. Like a wounded bird, she withdrew herself from the light and noisy
                        chatter of her friends, seeking only solitude and crepuscular nooks in which
                        to suffer silently. Jean brought her every picturesque bit of the ghastly
                        gossip, thus heaping <pb id="VAA2387-426" n="413"/> coals on the fire of her
                        torture. But she did not grow pale and thin. Not a dimple fled from cheek or
                        chin, not a ray of saucy sweetness vanished from her eyes. Her riant health
                        was unalterable. Indeed, the only change in her was a sudden ripening and
                        mellowing of her beauty, by which its colors, its lines, its subtle
                        undercurrents of expression were spiritualized, as if by some powerful
                        clarifying process.</p>
                    <p>Tremendous is the effect of a soul surprised by passion and brought hard up
                        against an opposing force which dashes it back upon itself with a flare and
                        explosion of self-revealment. Nor shall we ever be able to foretell just how
                        small a circumstance, just how slight an exigency, will suffice to bring on
                        the great change. The shifting of a smile to the gloom of a frown, the snap
                        of a string on the lute of our imagination, just at the point when a rich
                        melody is culminating; the waving of a hand, a vanishing faceany eclipse of
                        tender, joyous expectationdashes a nameless sense of despair into the soul.
                        And a young girl&apos;s soulwho shall uncover its sacred depths of
                        sensitiveness, or analyze its capacity for suffering under such a stroke?</p>
                    <p>On the fifth day of March, back came the victorious Helm, having surrounded
                        and captured seven boats, richly loaded with provisions and goods, and
                        Dejean&apos;s whole force. Then again the little creole town went wild
                        with rejoicing. Alice heard the news and the noise; but somehow there was no
                        response in her heart. She dreaded to meet Beverley; indeed, she did not
                        expect him to come to her. Why should he?</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-427" n="414"/>
                    <p>M. Roussillon, who had volunteered to accompany Helm, arrived in a mood of
                        unlimited proportions, so far as expressing self-admiration and abounding
                        delight was concerned. You would have been sure that he had done the whole
                        deed single-handed, and brought the flotilla and captives to town on his
                        back. But Oncle Jazon for once held his tongue, being too disgusted for
                        words at not having been permitted to fire a single shot. What was the use
                        of going to fight and simply meeting and escorting down the river a lot of
                        non-combatants?</p>
                    <p>There is something inscrutably delightful about a girl&apos;s way of
                        thinking one thing and doing another. Perversity, thy name is maidenhood;
                        and maidenhood, thy name is delicious inconsequence! When Alice heard that
                        Beverley had come back, safe, victorious, to be greeted as one of the heroes
                        of an important adventure, she immediately ran to her room frightened and
                        full of vague, shadowy dread, to hide from him, yet feeling sure that he
                        would not come! Moreover, she busied herself with the preposterous task of
                        putting on her most attractive gownthe buff brocade which she wore that
                        evening at the river househow long ago it seemed!when Beverley thought her
                        the queenliest beauty in the world. And she was putting it on so as to look
                        her prettiest while hiding from him!</p>
                    <p>It is a toss-up where happiness will make its nest. The palace, the hut, the
                        great lady&apos;s garden, the wild lass&apos;s bower,skip here,
                        alight there,the secret of it may never be told. And love and beauty find
                        lodgment, by the same inexplicable route, in the same extremes <pb
                            id="VAA2387-428" n="415"/> of circumstances. The wind bloweth where it
                        listeth, finding many a matchless flower and many a ravishing fragrance in
                        the wildest nooks of the world.</p>
                    <p>No sooner did Beverley land at the little wharf than, rushing to his
                        quarters, he made a hasty exchange of water-soaked apparel for something
                        more comfortable, and then bolted in the direction of Roussillon place.</p>
                    <p>Now Alice knew by the beating of her heart that he was coming. In spite of
                        all she could do, trying to hold on hard and fast to her doubt and gloom, a
                        tide of rich sweetness began to course through her heart and break in
                        splendid expectation from her eyes, as they looked through the little
                        unglazed window toward the fort. Nor had she long to wait. He came up the
                        narrow wet street, striding like a tall actor in the height of a melodrama,
                        his powerful figure erect as an Indian&apos;s, and his face glowing with
                        the joy of a genuine, impatient lover, who is proud of himself because of
                        the image he bears in his heart.</p>
                    <p>When Alice flung wide the door (which was before Beverley could cross the
                        veranda), she had quite forgotten how she had gowned and bedecked herself;
                        and so, without a trace of self-consciousness, she flashed upon him a
                        full-blown flowerto his eyes the loveliest that ever opened under heaven.</p>
                    <p>Gaspard Roussillon, still overflowing with the importance of his part in the
                        capture of Dejean, came puffing homeward just in time to see a man at the
                        door holding Alice a-tiptoe in his arms.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;Ziff!&quot;</hi> he cried, as he pushed open the
                        little front gate of the yard, <hi rend="i">&quot;en voil assez, vogue
                            la galre!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <pb id="VAA2387-429" n="416"/>
                    <p>The two forms disappeared within the house, as if moved by his roaring voice.</p>
                    <p>The letter to Beverley from his father was somewhat disturbing. It bore the
                        tidings of his mother&apos;s failing health. This made it easier for the
                        young Lieutenant to accept from Clark the assignment to duty with a party
                        detailed for the purpose of escorting Hamilton, Farnsworth and several other
                        British officers to Williamsburg, Virginia. It also gave him a most powerful
                        assistance in persuading Alice to marry him at once, so as to go with him on
                        what proved to be a delightful wedding journey through the great wilderness
                        to the Old Dominion. Spring&apos;s verdure burst abroad on the sunny
                        hills as they slowly went their way; the mating birds sang in every blooming
                        brake and grove by which they passed, and in their joyous hearts they heard
                        the bubbling of love&apos;s eternal fountain.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">AND SO IT ENDED</head>
                    <p>Our story must end here, because at this point its current flows away forever
                        from old Vincennes; and it was only of the post on the Wabash that we set
                        out to make a record. What befell Alice and Beverley after they went to
                        Virginia we could go on to tell; but that would be another story. Suffice it
                        to say, they lived happily ever after, or at least somewhat beyond three
                        score and ten, and left behind them a good name and numerous descendants.</p>
                    <p>How Alice found out her family in Virginia, we are not informed; but after a
                        lapse of some years from the date of her marriage, there appears in one of
                        her letters a reference to an estate inherited from her Tarleton ancestors,
                        and her name appears in old records signed in full, Alice Tarleton Beverley.
                        A descendant of hers still treasures the locket, with its broken miniature
                        and battered crest, which won Beverley&apos;s life from Long-Hair, the
                        savage. Beside it, as carefully guarded, is the Indian charm-stone that
                        stopped Hamilton&apos;s bullet over Alice&apos;s heart. The rapiers
                        have somehow disappeared, and there is a tradition in the Tarleton family
                        that they were given by Alice to Gaspard Roussillon, who, after Madame
                        Roussillon&apos;s death in 1790, went to New Orleans, where he stayed a
                        year or two before embarking for France, whither <pb id="VAA2387-431"
                            n="418"/> he took with him the beautiful pair of colechemardes and Jean
                        the hunchback.</p>
                    <p>Oncle Jazon lived in Vincennes many years after the war was over; but he died
                        at Natchez, Mississippi, when ninety-three years old. He said, with almost
                        his last breath, that he couldn&apos;t shoot very well, even in his best
                        days; but that he had, upon various occasions, &quot;jes&apos; kind
                        o&apos; happened to hit a Injun in the lef&apos; eye.&quot; They
                        used to tell a story, as late as General Harrison&apos;s stay in
                        Vincennes, about how Oncle Jazon buried his collection of scalps, with great
                        funeral solemnity, as his part of the celebration of peace and independence
                        about the year 1784.</p>
                    <p>Good old Father Beret died suddenly soon after Alice&apos;s marriage and
                        departure for Virginia. He was found lying face downward on the floor of his
                        cabin. Near him, on a smooth part of a puncheon, were the mildewed fragments
                        of a letter, which he had been arranging, as if to read its contents.
                        Doubtless it was the same letter brought to him by Ren de Ronville, as
                        recorded in an early chapter of our story. The fragments were gathered up
                        and buried with him. His dust lies under the present Church of St.
                        Xavier,the dust of as noble a man and as true a priest as ever sacrificed
                        himself for the good of humanity.</p>
                    <p>In after years Simon Kenton visited Beverley and Alice in their Virginia
                        home. To his dying day he was fond of describing their happy and hospitable
                        welcome and the luxuries to which they introduced him. They lived in a
                        stately white mansion on a hill overlooking a vast tobacco plantation, where
                        hundreds <pb id="VAA2387-432" n="419"/> of negro slaves worked and sang by
                        day and frolicked by night. Their oldest child was named Fitzhugh Gaspard.
                        Kenton died in 1836.</p>
                    <p>There remains but one little fact worth recording before we close the book.
                        In the year 1800, on the fourth of July, a certain leading French family of
                        Vincennes held a patriotic reunion, during which a little old flag was
                        produced and its story told. Some one happily proposed that it be sent to
                        Mrs. Alice Tarleton Beverley with a letter of explanation, and in profound
                        recognition of the glorious circumstances which made it the true flag of the
                        great Northwest.</p>
                    <p>And so it happened that Alice&apos;s little banner went to Virginia and
                        is still preserved in an old mansion not very far from Monticello; but it
                        seems likely that the Wabash Valley will soon again possess the precious
                        relic. The marriage engagement of Miss Alice Beverley to a young Indiana
                        officer, distinguished for his patriotism and military ardor, has been
                        announced at the old Beverley homestead on the hill, and the high
                        contracting parties have planned that the wedding ceremony shall take place
                        under the famous little flag, on the anniversary of Clark&apos;s capture
                        of Post Vincennes. When the bride shall be brought to her new home on the
                        banks of the Wabash, the flag will come with her; but Oncle Jazon will not
                        be on hand with his falsetto shout: <hi rend="i">&quot;Vive la bannire
                            d&apos;Alice Roussillon! Vive Zhorzh Vasinton!&quot;</hi>

                <head>Acknowledgement</head>
                <p>The publishers and the author of this book feel a great pleasure in expressing
                    their sense of obligation to the historical work of the late William H. English,
                    and to his son, Captain William E. English, for most valuable historical details
                    and documents connected with the annals of Old Vincennes. Too much praise cannot
                    be given a book like &quot;English&apos;s Conquest of the North-West and
                    Life of General George Rogers Clark;&quot; it is a monumental achievement of
                    the largest importance.</p>
                <p>From it the publishers of &quot;Alice of Old Vincennes&quot; caught the
                    suggestion which led them to propose a novel covering the main facts and most
                    romantic incidents of Colonel George Rogers Clark&apos;s memorable, yet
                    almost forgotten, campaign on the Wabash in mid-winter of 1779.</p>
                <p>The author of this romance would call the special attention of young students to
                    the fact that in &quot;Alice of Old Vincennes&quot; there is not
                    material deviation from the truth of history set forth in English&apos;s
                    voluminous and all comprehensive work, which should be in every American
                    library.</p>
                <p>Read together, the history and the romance will, it is hoped, make a vivid and
                    authentic impression of a period of strenuous and heroic life, the glory and
                    value of which must forever be kept sacred by the descendants of heroes.</p>
                <p>In his dedicatory preface the author has acknowledged, as far as was possible
                    without touching upon forbidden ground, another rich source of information which
                    at present is reserved in the private collection of a distinguished Creole
                    family honorably connected with the early life of Old Vincennes.</p>
