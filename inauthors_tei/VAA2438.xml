                        <p>"It will be an undoubtabel surprise to you to git the poem I now send to
                            you herein enclosed; but I was a-readin' one which starts out "God moves
                            in a mysterious way His wunders to purform," and the idy struck me that
                            I could write off somepin in that style which would express a man's
                            views that still ain't no perfessor of religion, ner a member of no
                            church, as I take fer granted Watts was when he wrote that and the rest
                            of all his hymn-book full of the same kind."</p>
                        <p>The poem sent is something of a surprise to us, but none the less a
                            pleasant one. But while we place it with pride before Mr. Riley's
                            admirers we beg to inform the author that while Mr. Watts has given to
                            hymnal literature a numberless array of very creditable verses, the poem
                            referred to by Mr. Riley is by no means a Watts production. "God Moves
                            in a Mysterious Way" was written by William Cowper, the English poet,
                            who was as little a pretender of religion, perhaps, as Mr. Riley
                            himself, since that famous poem was written immediately upon returning
                            from an unsuccessful attempt at suicidean idea which seems never to have
                            occurred to Mr. Watts.</p>
                        <p>Here is Mr. Riley's effort:</p>

                            <l n="25">At once I loved her as the leaves love dew</l>
                            <l n="26">In midmost summer when the days are new.</l>

                            <l n="29">Out of the bright May morning of her hair,</l>
                            <l n="30">And bound and gave it to me laughingly,</l>
                            <l n="31">And caught my hands and called me "Little girl,"</l>
                            <l n="32">Tip-toeing as she spoke to kiss me there!</l>
                            <l n="33">And I stood dazed and dumb for very stress</l>
                            <l n="34">Of my great happiness.</l>
                            <l n="35">She plucked me by the gown, nor saw how mean</l>

                            <l n="46">She was the dazzling shineI, the dark shade,</l>
                            <l n="47">And we did mingle, like to these, and thus,</l>

                            <l n="52">Cried, "Oh, 'tis Father!"all the blossoms gone</l>
                            <l n="53">From out her cheeks as those from out her grasp.</l>

                            <l n="59">And, with wet eyes, repeating o'er and o'er,</l>

                            <l n="109">Then, after I had laid them with the tress</l>

                        <head>A WILD IRISHMAN.</head>
                        <p>Not many years ago the writer was for some months stationed at South
                            Bend, a thriving little city of northern Indiana, its main population on
                            the one side of the St. Joseph river, but quite a respectable fraction
                            thereof taking its industrial way to the opposite shore, and there
                            gaining an audience and a hearing in the rather imposing growth and
                            hurly-burly of its big manufactories, and the consequent rapid
                            appearance of multitudinous neat cottages, tenement houses and business
                            blocks. A stranger, entering South Bend proper on an ordinary day, will
                            be at some loss to account for its very prosperous appearance its
                            flagged and bowldered streetsits handsome mercantile blocks, banks and
                            business houses generally. Reasoning from cause to effect, and seeing
                            but a meagre sprinkling of people on the streets throughout the day, and
                            these seeming, for the most part, merely idlers, and in no wise
                            accessory to the evident thrift and opulence of their surroundings, the
                            observant stranger will be puzzled at the situation. But when evening
                            comes, and the outlying foundries, sewing-machine, wagon, plow, and
                            other " works," together <pb id="VAA2438-177" n="172"/> with the paper
                            mills and all the nameless industrieswhen the operations of all these
                            are suspended for the day, and the workmen and workwomen loosed from
                            laborthen, as this vast army suddenly invades and overflows bridge,
                            roadway, street and lane, the startled stranger will fully comprehend
                            the why and wherefore of the city's high prosperity. And, once
                            acquainted with the people there, the fortunate sojourner will find no
                            ordinary culture and intelligence, and, as certainly, he will meet with
                            a social spirit and a whole-souled heartiness that will make the place a
                            lasting memory. The town, too, is the home of many world-known notables,
                            and a host of local celebrities, the chief of which latter class I
                            found, during my stay there, in the person of Tommy Stafford, or "The
                            Wild Irishman," as everybody called him.</p>
                        <p>"Talk of odd fellows and eccentric characters," said Major Blowney, my
                            employer, one afternoon, "you must see our 'Wild Irishman' here before
                            you say you've yet found the queerest, brightest, cleverest chap in all
                            your travels. What d' ye say, Stockford?" And the Major paused in his
                            work of charging cartridges for his new breech-loading shotgun and
                            turned to await his partner's response,</p>
                        <p>Stockford, thus addressed, paused above the <pb id="VAA2438-178" n="173"
                            /> shield sign he was lettering, slowly smiling as he dipped and trailed
                            his pencil through the ivory black upon a bit of broken glass and said
                            in his deliberate, half - absent - minded way, "Is it Tommy you are
                            telling him about?" and then, with a gradual broadening of the smile, he
                            went on, "Well, I should say so. Tommy! What's come of the fellow,
                            anyway? I haven't seen him since his last bout with the mayor, on his
                            trial for shakin' up that fast-horse man."</p>
                        <p>"The fast-horse man got just exactly what he needed, too," said the
                            genial Major, laughing, and mopping his perspiring brow. "The fellow was
                            barkin' up the wrong stump when he tackled Tommy! Got beat in the trade,
                            at his own game, you know, and wound up by an insult that no Irishman
                            would take; and Tommy just naturally wore out the hall carpet of the old
                            hotel with him!"</p>
                        <p>" And then collared and led him to the mayor's office himself, they
                            say!"</p>
                        <p>"Oh, he did!" said the Major, with a dash of pride in the confirmation;
                            "that's Tommy all over!"</p>
                        <p>"Funny trial, wasn't it?" continued the ruminating Stockford.</p>
                        <p>"Wasn't it, though?" laughed the Major. "The porter's testimony: You see,
                            he was for <pb id="VAA2438-179" n="174"/> Tommy, of course, and on
                            examination testified that the horse-man struck Tommy first. And Tommy
                            broke in with: 'He's a-meanin' well, yer Honor, but he's lyin' to yehe's
                            lyin' to ye. No livin' man iver struck me firstnor last, nayther, for
                            the matter o' that!' And I thought the court would die," concluded the
                            Major, in a like imminent state of merriment.</p>
                        <p>"Yes, and he said if he struck him first," supplemented Stockford, "he'd
                            like to know why the horse-man was wearin' all the black eyes, and the
                            blood, and the boomps on the head of um!' And it's that talk of his that
                            got him off with so light a fine!"</p>
                        <p>"As it always does," said the Major, coming to himself abruptly and
                            looking at his watch. "Stock', you say you're not going along with our
                            duck-shooting party this time? The old Kankakee is just lousy with 'em
                            this season!"</p>
                        <p>"Can't go possibly," said Stockford, "not on account of the work at all,
                            but the folks at home ain't as well as I'd like to see them, and I'll
                            stay here till they're better. Next time I'll try and be ready for you.
                            Going to take Tommy, of course?"</p>
                        <p>"Of course! Got to have 'The Wild Irishman' with us! I'm going around to
                            find him now." Then turning to me the Major continued, <pb
                                id="VAA2438-180" n="175"/> "Suppose you get on your coat and hat and
                            come along. It's the best chance you'll ever have to meet with Tommy.
                            It's late anyhow, and Stockford'll get along without you. Come on!"</p>
                        <p>"Certainly," said Stockford; "Go ahead. And you can take him ducking,
                            too, if he wants to go."</p>
                        <p>"But he doesn't want to goand won't go," replied the Major with a
                            commiserative glance at me. "Says he doesn't know a duck from a
                            poll-parrotnor how to load a shot-gunand couldn't hit a house if he were
                            inside of it and the door shut. Admits that he nearly killed his uncle
                            once, on the other side of a tree, with a squirrel runnin' down it.
                            Don't want him along!"</p>
                        <p>Reaching the street with the genial Major, he gave me this advice: "Now,
                            when you meet Tommy, you mustn't take all he says for dead earnest, and
                            you musn't believe, because he talks loud, and in italics every other
                            word, that he wants to do all the talking and won't be interfered with.
                            That's the way he's apt to strike folks at firstbut it's their mistake,
                            not his. Talk back to himcontrovert him whenever he's aggressive in the
                            utterance of his opinions, and if you're only honest in the announcement
                            of your own ideas and beliefs, he'll like you all the better <pb
                                id="VAA2438-181" n="176"/> for standing by them. He's quick
                            tempered, and perhaps a trifle sensitive, so share your greater patience
                            with him, and he'll pay you back by fighting for you at the drop of the
                            hat. In short, he's as nearly typical of his oppressed country's brave,
                            impetuous, fun-loving individuality as such a likeness can exist."</p>
                        <p>"But is he quarrelsome? "I asked.</p>
                        <p>"Not at all. There's the trouble. If he'd only quarrel, there'd be no
                            harm done. Quarreling's cheap, and Tommy's extravagant. A big blacksmith
                            here, the other day, kicked some boy out of his shop, and Tommy, on his
                            cart, happened to be passing at the time; and he just jumped off without
                            a word, and went in and worked on that fellow for about three minutes,
                            with such disastrous results that they couldn't tell his shop from a
                            slaughter-house; paid an assault and battery fine, and gave the boy a
                            dollar beside, and the whole thing was a positive luxury to him! But I
                            guess we'd better drop the subject, for here's his cart, and here's
                            Tommy. Hi! there, you 'far-down' Irish Mick!" called the Major, in
                            affected antipathy, "been out raiding the honest farmers' hen-roosts
                            again, have you?"</p>
                        <p>We halted at a corner grocery and produce store, as I took it, and the
                            smooth-faced, shave-headed man in woolen shirt, short vest, and
                            suspenderless <pb id="VAA2438-182" n="177"/> trousers so boisterously
                            addressed by the Major, was just lifting from the back of his cart a
                            coop of cackling chickens.</p>
                        <p>"Arrah,' ye blasted Kerryonian!" replied the handsome fellow, depositing
                            the coop on the currio and straightening his tall, slender figure; "I
                            were jist thinkin' of yez and the ducks, and here ye come quackin' into
                            the prisence of r'yalty, wid yer canvas-back suit upon ye and the

                        <p>"We're to start just as soon as we get the boys together," said the
                            Major, shaking hands. "The crowd's to be at Andrews' by 4, and it fully
                            that now; so come on at once. We'll go 'Round by Munson's and have Hi
                            send a boy to look after your horse. Come; and I want to introduce my
                            friend here to you, and we'll all want to smoke and jabber a little in
                            appropriate seclusion. Come on" And the impatient Major had linked arms
                            with his hesitating ally and my-L self and was turning the corner of the
                            street.</p>
                        <p>"It's an hour's work I have yet wid the squawkers," mildly protested
                            Tommy, still hanging back and stepping a trifle high; "but, as one
                            Irishman would say til another, 'Ye're wrong, but I'm wid ye!'"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA2438-183" n="178"/>
                        <p>And five minutes later the three of us had joined a very jolly party in a
                            snug back room, with</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">The chamber walls depicted all around</l>

                        </lg>
                        <p>And where, as well, drifted over the olfactory intelligence a certain
                            subtle, warm-breathed aroma, that genially combatted the chill and
                            darkness of the day without, and, resurrecting long-dead Christmases,
                            brimmed the grateful memory with all comfortable cheer.</p>
                        <p>A dozen hearty voices greeted the appearance of Tommy and the Major, the
                            latter adroitly pushing the jovial Irishman to the front, with a
                            mock-heroic introduction to the general company at the conclusion of
                            which Tommy, with his hat tucked under his left elbow, stood bowing with
                            a grace of pose and presence Lord Chesterfield might have applauded.</p>
                        <p>"Gintlemen," said Tommy, settling back upon his heels and admiringly
                            contemplating the group; "Gintlemen, I congratulate you wid a pride that

                        <p>"The Duck-hunters of the Kankakee!" chorused the elated party in such
                            musical uproar that for a full minute the voice of the enthusiastic <pb
                                id="VAA2438-185" n="180"/> Majorwho was trying to say somethingcould
                            not be heard. Then he said:</p>
                        <p>"I want to propose that theme" The Duck-hunters of the Kankakee for one
                            of Tommy's improvizations. I move we have a song now from Tommy on the
                            'Duck-hunters of the Kan-kakee.'"</p>
                        <p>"Hurra! hurra! A song from Tommy," cried the crowd. "Make us up a song,
                            and put us all into it! A song from Tommy! A song! a song!"</p>
                        <p>There was a queer light in the eye of the Irishman. I observed him
                            narrowly-expectantly. Often I had read of this phenomenal art of
                            improvised balled-singing, but had always remained a little skeptical in
                            regard to the possibility of such a feat. Even in the notable instances
                            of this gift as displayed by the very clever Theodore Hook, I had always
                            half suspected some prior preparationsome adroit forecasting of the
                            sequence that seemed the inspiration of his witty verses. Here was
                            evidently to be a test-example, and mechanically I found pencil and
                            blank paper in my hand.</p>
                        <p>The clamor had subsided, and Tommy had drawn a chair near to and directly
                            fronting the Major's. His right hand was extended, closely grasping the
                            right hand of his friend which he <pb id="VAA2438-186" n="181"/> scarce
                            perceptibly, though measureedly, lifted and let fall throughout the
                            length of all the curious performance. The voice was not unmusical, nor
                            was the quaint old ballad-air adopted by the singer unlovely in the
                            least; simply a monotony was evident that accorded with the levity and
                            chance-finish of the improvisationand that the song was improvised on
                            the instant I am certain though in no wise remarkable, for other
                            reasons, in rhythmic worth or finish. And while his smiling auditors all
                            drew nearer, and leant, with parted lips, to catch every syllable, the
                            words of strange melody trailed unhesitatingly into the lines literally
                            as here subjoined:</p>

                        <p>"Hurra! for the Kankakee! Give it to us, Tommy!" cried an enthused voice
                            between verses. "Now give it to the Major!" And the song went on:</p>

                        <p>And half a dozen jubilant palms patted the Major's shoulders, and his
                            ruddy, good-natured face beamed with delight. "Now give it to the rest
                            of 'em, Tommy!" chuckled the Major. And the song continued:</p>

                        <p>"Hold on, Tommy!" chipped in one of the Andrews; "you must give 'the

                        <p>"Make 'em pay for it if you do!" said the Major in an undertone. And
                            Tommy promptly amended:</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">O, the Andrews Brothers, they'll be there,</l>
                            <l n="2">Wid good se-gyars and wine to shpare</l>
                            <l n="3">They'll treat us here on fine champagne,</l>
                            <l n="4">And when we're there they'll treat again.</l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>The applause here was vociferous, and only discontinued when a box of
                            Havanas stood open upon the table. During the momentary lull thus
                            occasioned, I caught the Major's twinkling eyes glancing evasively
                            toward me, as he leant whispering <pb id="VAA2438-188" n="183"/> some
                            further instructions to Tommy, who again took up his desultory ballad,
                            while I arose and fled for the street, catching, however, as I went, and
                            high above the laughter of the crowd, the satire of this quatrain to its
                            latest line:</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">But R-R-Riley he'll not go, I guess,</l>
                            <l n="2">Lest he'd get lost in the wil-der-ness,</l>
                            <l n="3">And so in the city he will shtop</l>
                            <l n="4">For to curl his hair in the barber shop.</l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>It was after 6 when I reached the hotel, but I had my hair trimmed before
                            I went down to supper. The style of trimming I adopted then I still
                            adhere to, and call it " the Tommy Stafford stubble crop."</p>
                        <p>Ten days passed before I again saw the Major. Immediately upon his
                            returnit was late afternoon when I heard of itI determined to take my
                            evening walk out the long street toward his pleasant home and call upon
                            him there. This I did, and found him, in a wholesome state of fatigue,
                            slippers and easy chair, enjoying his pipe on the piazza. Of course he
                            was overflowing with happy reminiscences of the hunt the wood
                            -and-water-craft boats ambushesdecoys, and tramp and camp and so on,
                            without end:but I wanted to hear him talk of "The Wild Irishman "Tommy;
                            and I think, too, now, that the sagacious Major secretly read <pb
                                id="VAA2438-189" n="184"/> my desires all the time. To be utterly
                            frank with the reader I will admit that I not only think that the Major
                            divined my interest in Tommy, but I know he did, for at last, as though
                            reading my very thoughts, he abruptly said, after a long pause, in which
                            he knocked the ashes from his pipe and refilled and lighted it: "Well,
                            all I know of 'The Wild Irishman' I can tell you in a very few wordsthat
                            is, if you care at all to listen?" And the crafty old Major seemed to
                            hesitate.</p>
                        <p>"Go ongo on! "I said, eagerly.</p>
                        <p>"About forty years ago," resumed the Major, placidly, "in the little,
                            old, unheard-of town of Karnteel, County Tyrone, Province Ulster,
                            Ireland, Tommy Staffordin spite of the contrary opinion of his
                            wretchedly poor parentswas fortunate enough to be born. And here again,
                            as I advised you the other day, you must be prepared for constant
                            surprises in the study of Tommy's character."</p>
                        <p>"Go on," I said; "I'm prepared for any-thing."</p>
                        <p>The Major smiled profoundly and continued:</p>
                        <p>"Fifteen years ago, when he came to Americaand the Lord only knows how he
                            got the passage-moneyhe brought his widowed mother <pb id="VAA2438-190"
                                n="185"/> with him here, and has supported, and is still supporting
                            her. Besides," went on the still secretly smiling Major, " the fellow
                            has actually found time, through all his adversities, to pick up quite a
                            smattering of education, here and there"</p>
                        <p>"Poor fellow!" I broke in, sympathizingly, " what a pity it is that he
                            couldn't have had such advantages earlier in life," and as I recalled
                            the broad brogue of the fellow, together with his careless dress,
                            recognizing beneath it all the native talent and brilliancy of a mind of
                            most uncommon worth, I could not restrain a deep sigh of compassion and
                            regret.</p>
                        <p>The Major was leaning forward in the gathering dusk, and evidently
                            studying my own face, the expression of which, at that moment, was very
                            grave and solemn, I am sure. He suddenly threw himself backward in his
                            chair, in an uncontrollable burst of laughter. "Oh, I just can't keep it
                            up any longer!" he exclaimed.</p>
                        <p>"Keep what up?" I queried, in a perfect maze of bewilderment and
                            surprise: "Keep what up? "I repeated.</p>
                        <p>"Why, all this twaddle, farce, travesty and by-play regarding Tommy! You
                            know I warned you over and over, and you musn't blame me for the
                            deception. I never thought you'd take it so <pb id="VAA2438-191" n="186"
                            /> in earnest!" and here the jovial Major again went into convulsions of
                            laughter.</p>
                        <p>"But I don't understand a word of it at all," I cried, half-frenzied with
                            the gnarl and tangle of the whole affair. "' What 'twaddle, farce and
                            travesty,' is it anyhow?" And in my vexation I found myself on my feet,
                            and striding nervously up and down the paved walk that joined the street
                            with the piazza, pausing at last and confronting the Major most
                            savagely. "Please explain," I said, controlling myself with an
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>The Major arose, "Your striding up and down there reminds me that a
                            little stroll on the street might do us both good," he said. "Will you
                            wait till I get a coat and hat?"</p>
                        <p>He rejoined me a moment later, and we passed through the open gate; and
                            saying, "Let's go down this way," he took my arm and turned into a
                            street where, cooling as the dusk was, the thick maples lining the walk
                            seemed to throw a special shade of tranquility upon us.</p>
                        <p>"What I meant was "began the Major, in a low, serious voice,"What I meant
                            wassimply this: Our friend Tommy, though the truest Irishman in the
                            world, is a man quite the opposite every way of the character he
                            appeared to you. All that rich brogue of his is assumed. <pb
                                id="VAA2438-192" n="187"/> Though poor, as I told you, when he came
                            here, his native quickness, and his marvelous resources tact, judgment,
                            business qualitiesall have helped him to the equivalent of a liberal
                            education. His love of the humorous and the ridiculous is unbounded; but
                            he has serious moments as well, and at such times is as dignified and
                            refined in speech and manner as any man you'd find in a thousand. He is
                            a good speaker, can stir a political convention to fomentation when he
                            gets fired up; and can write an article for the press that goes to the
                            spot. He gets into a good many personal encounters of a rather
                            undignified character; but they are almost invariably bred of his innate
                            interest in the 'underdog,' and the fire-and-tow of his impetuous
                            nature."</p>
                        <p>My companion had paused here, and was looking through some printed slips
                            in his pocket-book. "I wanted you to see some of the fellow's articles
                            in print, but I have nothing of importance hereonly some of his
                            'doggeral,' as he calls it, and you've had a sample of that. But there's
                            a bit of his native dialect you should hear him recite. You may keep
                            that if you care to. The boys all fell in love with it, hearing his
                            rendition of it, and wanted copies. So we had a lot printed, and I have
                            two or three left. Put it in your pocket and read it at your
                            leisure."</p>

                        <p>"Before we turn back, now," said the smiling Major, as I stood lingering
                            over the indefinable humor of the last refrain, "before we turn back I
                            want to show you something eminently characteristic. Come this way a
                            half dozen steps."</p>
                        <p>As he spoke I looked up, to observe that we had paused before a handsome
                            square brick residence, centering a beautiful smooth lawn, its emerald
                            only littered with the light gold of the earliest autumn leaves. On
                            either side of the trim walk that led up from the gate to the curved
                            stone balusters of the broad piazza, with its empty easy chairs, were
                            graceful vases, frothing over with late blossoms, and wreathed with
                            laurel looking vines; and, luxuriantly lacing the border <pb
                                id="VAA2438-195" n="190"/> of the pave that turned the further
                            corner of the house, blue, white and crimson, pink, and violet, went
                            fading in perspective as my gaze followed the gesture of the
                            Major's.</p>
                        <p>"Here, come a little further. Now you can see him, can't you?"</p>
                        <p>Yes, I could make out a figure in the deepening duskthe figure of a man
                            on the back stoop a tired-looking man, in his shirt-sleeves, that sat
                            upon a low chairno, not a chairan empty box. He was leaning forward with
                            his elbows resting on his knees, and the hands dropped limp. He was
                            smoking, too; I could barely see his pipe, and but for the odor of very
                            strong tobacco would not have known he had a pipe. Why does the master
                            of the house permit his servants to so desecrate this beautiful home? I
                            thought.</p>
                        <p>"Well, shall we go now?" said the Major.</p>
                        <p>I turned silently and we retraced our steps. I think neither of us spoke
                            for the distance of a square.</p>
                        <p>"Guess you didn't know the man there on the back porch?" said the
                            Major.</p>
                        <p>"No; why?" I asked dubiously.</p>
                        <p>"I hardly thought you would, and besides the poor fellow's tired, and it
                            was best not to disturb him," said the Major.</p>
                        <p>"Why, who was itsome one I know?"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA2438-196" n="191"/>
                        <p>"It was Tommy."</p>
                        <p>"Oh," said I, queryingly. "He's employed there in some capacity?"</p>
                        <p>"Yes, as master of the house."</p>
                        <p>"You don't mean it?"</p>
                        <p>"I certainly do. He owns it, and made every cent of the money that paid
                            for it!" said the Major proudly. That's why I wanted you particularly to
                            note that 'eminent characteristic' I spoke of. Tommy could just as well
                            be sitting, with a fine cigar, on the front piazza in an easy chair, as
                            with his dhudeen, on the back porch, on an empty box, where every night
                            you'll find him. It's the unconscious dropping back into the old ways of
                            his father, and his father's father, and his father's father's father.
                            In brief, he sits there the poor lorn symbol of the long oppression of
                            his race.</p>

                        <p>J<hi rend="sc">OHN</hi> B. McK<hi rend="sc">INNEY</hi>, attorney and
                            counselor at-law, as his sign read, was, for many reasons, a fortunate
                            man, and for many other reasons he was not. He was chiefly fortunate in
                            being, as certain opponents often strove to witheringly designate him,
                            "the son of his father," since that sound old gentleman was the
                            wealthiest farmer in that section, with but one son and heir to, in
                            time, supplant him in the role of "county god," and haply perpetuate the
                            prouder title of "the biggest tax-payer on the assessment list." And
                            this fact, too, fortunate as it would seem, was doubtless the indirect
                            occasion of a liberal percentage of all John's misfortunes. From his
                            earliest schooldays in the little town, up to his tardy graduation from
                            a distant college, the influence of his father's wealth invited his
                            procrastination, humored its results, encouraged the laxity of his
                            ambition, "and even now," as John used, in bitter irony, to put it, "it
                            is aiding and abetting me in the ostensible practice of my chosen
                            profession, a listless, aimless, undetermined man of forty, and a
                            confirmed bachelor at that!" At the utterance of this self-depreciating
                            statement, John <pb id="VAA2438-198" n="[]"/>

                            top of his desk; and, rising and kicking his chair back to the wall, he
                            would stump around his littered office till the manilla carpet steamed
                            with dust. Then he would wildly break away, seeking refuge either in the
                            open street or his room at the old- time tavern, the Eagle House,
                            "where," he would say, "I have lodged and boarded, I do solemnly
                            asseverate, for a long, unbroken, middle-aged eternity of ten years, and
                            can yet assert, in the words of the more fortunately-dying Webster, that
                            'I still live!'"</p>
                        <p>Extravagantly satirical as he was at times, John had always an
                            indefinable drollery about him that made him agreeable company to his
                            friends, at least; and such an admiring friend he had constantly at hand
                            in the person of Bert Haines. Both were Bohemians in natural tendency,
                            and, though John was far in Bert's advance in point of age, he found the
                            young man "just the kind of a fellow to have around." And so it was,
                            when summer days were dull and tedious, these two could muse and doze,
                            the hours away together; and when the nights were long, and dark, and
                            deep, and beautiful, they could drift out in the noon-light of the
                            stars, and with "the soft complaining flute" and "warbling lute," "lay
                            the pipes," as John would say, "for <pb id="VAA2438-200" n="194"/> our
                            enduring popularity with the girls!" And it was immediately subsequent
                            to one of these romantic excursions, when the belated pair, at 2 o'clock
                            in the morning, had skulked up a side stairway of the old hotel, and
                            gained John's room, with nothing more serious happening than Bert's
                            falling over a trunk and smashing his guitar,just after such a night of
                            romance and adventure it was that, in the seclusion of John's room, Bert
                            had something of especial import to communicate.</p>
                        <p>"Mack," he said, as that worthy anathe- matized a spiteful match, and
                            then sucked his finger.</p>
                        <p>"Blast the all-fired old torch!" said John, wrestling with the lamp-flue,
                            and turning on a welcome flame at last. "Well, you said 'Mack!' Why
                            don't you go on? And don't bawl at top of your lungs, either. You've
                            already succeeded in waking every boarder in the house with that guitar,
                            and you want to make amends now, by letting them go to sleep again!"</p>
                        <p>"But my dear fellow," said Bert, with forced calmness, "you're the fellow
                            that's making all the noiseand"</p>
                        <p>"Why, you howling dervish!" interrupted John, with a feigned air of
                            pleased surprise and admiration. "But let's drop controversy. Throw <pb
                                id="VAA2438-201" n="195"/> the fragments of your guitar in the
                            wood-box there, and proceed with the opening proposition."</p>
                        <p>"What I was going to say was this," said Bert, with a half-desperate
                            enunciation; "I'm getting tired of this way of livingclean, dead-tired,
                            and fagged out, and sick of the whole artificial business!"</p>
                        <p>"Oh, yes!" exclaimed John, with a towering disdain, "you needn't go any
                            further! I know just what malady is throttling you. Its reformreform!
                            You're going to 'turn over a new leaf,' and all that, and sign the
                            pledge, and quit cigars, and go to work, and pay your debts, and
                            graviate back into Sunday-school, where you can make love to the
                            preacher's daughter under the guise of religion, and desecrate the
                            sanctity of the innermost pale of the church by confessions at class of
                            your 'thorough conversion!' Oh, you're going to"</p>
                        <p>"No, but I'm going to do nothing of the sort," said Bert resentfully.
                            "What I meanif you'll let me finishis, I'm getting too old to be
                            eternally undignifying myself with this 'singing of midnight strains
                            under Bonnybell's window-panes,' and too old to be keeping myself in
                            constant humiliation and expense by the borrowing and stringing up of
                            old guitars, together with <pb id="VAA2438-202" n="196"/> the breakage
                            of the same, and the general wear-and-tear on a constitution that is
                            slowly being sapped to its foundations by exposure in the night air and
                            the dew." "And while you receive no further compensation in return,"
                            said John, "than, perhaps, the coy turning-up of a lamp at an upper
                            casement where the jasmine climbs, or an exasperating patter of
                            invisible palms, or a huge dank wedge of fruit-cake shoved at you by the
                            old man, through a crack in the door."</p>
                        <p>"Yes, and I'm going to have my just reward, is what I mean," said Bert;
                            "and exchange the lover's life for the benedict's. Going to hunt out a
                            good sensible girl and marry her." And as the young man concluded this
                            desperate avowal he jerked the bow of his cravat into a hard knot,
                            kicked his hat under the bed, and threw himself on the sofa like an old
                            suit.</p>
                        <p>John stared at him with absolute compassion. "Poor devil," he said, half
                            musingly, "I know just how he feels</p>

                        <p>"Oh, here!" exclaimed the wretched Bert, jumping to his feet; "let up on
                            that dismal recitative. It would make a dog howl to hear that."</p>
                        <p>" Then you 'let up' on that suicidal talk of marrying," replied John,
                            "and all that harangue of incoherency about your growing old. Why, my
                            dear fellow, you're at least a dozen years my junior, and look at me!"
                            And John glanced at himself in the glass with a feeble pride, noting the
                            gray sparseness of his side-hair, and its plaintive dearth on top. "Of
                            course I've got to admit," he continued, "that my hair is gradually
                            evaporating; but for all that, I'm 'still in the ring,' don't you know;
                            as young in society, for the matter of that, as yourself! And this is
                            just the reason why I don't want you to blight every prospect in your
                            life by marrying at your ageespecially a womanI mean the kind of woman
                            you'd be sure to fancy at your age."</p>
                        <p>"Didn't I say 'a good, sensible girl' was the kind I had selected? "Bert
                            remonstrated.</p>
                        <p>"Oh!" exclaimed John, "you've selected her then? And without one word to
                            me!" he ended rebukingly.</p>
                        <p>"Well, hang it all!" said Bert, impatiently; "I knew how you were, and
                            just how you'd <pb id="VAA2438-204" n="198"/> talk me out of it, and I
                            made up my mind that for once, at least, I'd follow the dictates of a
                            heart thathowever malleable in youthful frivolitiesshould beat in
                            manhood loyal to itself and loyal to its own affinity."</p>
                        <p>"Go it! Fire away! Farewell, vain world!" exclaimed the excited John.
                            "Trade your soul off for a pair of ear bobs and a button hooka hank of
                            jute hair and a box of lily-white! I've buried not less than ten old
                            chums this way, and here's another nominated for the tomb! How dare I
                            ever trust again in transitory man!"</p>
                        <p>It was a bright morning when the slothful John was aroused by a long,
                            vociferous pounding on the door. He started up in bed to find himself
                            alonethe victim of his wrathful irony having evidently risen and fled
                            away while his pitiless tormentor slept" Doubtless to at once accomplish
                            that nefarious intent as set forth by his unblushing confession of last
                            night," mused the miserable John, and he ground his fingers in the
                            corners of his swollen eyes, and leered grimly at the feverish orbs,
                            blood-shotten, blurred and aching.</p>
                        <p>The pounding on the door continued. John looked at his watch; it was only
                            8 o'clock.</p>
                        <p>"Hi, there!" he called viciously. "What do you mean, anyhow?" he went on,
                            elevating <pb id="VAA2438-205" n="199"/> his voice again; "shaking a man
                            out of bed when he's just dropping into his first sleep?"</p>
                        <p>"I mean that you're going to get up; that's what!" replied a firm female
                            voice. "It's 8 o'clock, and I want to put your room in order, and I'm
                            not going to wait all day about it, either! Get up and go down to your
                            breakfast, and let me have the room!" And the clamor at the door was
                            industriously renewed.</p>
                        <p>"Say!" called John, querulously, hurrying on his clothes, "Say, you!"</p>
                        <p>"There's no say about it!" responded the determined voice; "I've heard
                            about you, and your ways around this house, and I'm not going to put up
                            with it! You'll not lie in bed till high noon when I've got to keep your
                            room in proper order!"</p>
                        <p>"Oh, ho!" said John, "reckon you're the new invasion here? Doubtless
                            you're the girl that's been hanging up the new window blinds that won't
                            roll, and disguising the pillows with clean slips, and 'hennin' around
                            among my books and papers on the table here, and ageing me generally
                            till I don't know my own handwriting by the time I find it. Oh, yes!
                            you're going to revolutionize things here; you're going to introduce
                            promptness, and system, and order. See you've even filled the
                            wash-pitcher and tucked two <pb id="VAA2438-206" n="200"/> starched
                            towels through the handle. Haven't got any tin towels, have you? I
                            rather like this new soap, too! So solid and durable, you know;
                            warranted not to raise a lather. Might as well wash one's hands with a
                            door knob! "And as John's voice grumbled away into the sullen silence
                            again, the determined voice without responded: "Oh, you can growl away
                            to your heart's content, Mr. McKinney, but I want you to distinctly
                            understand that I'm not going to humor you in any of your old bachelor
                            slug-gardly, slovenly ways, and whims and notions. And I want you to
                            understand, too, that I am not hired help in this house, nor a
                            chambermaid, nor anything of the kind. I'm the landlady here, and I'll
                            give you just five minutes more to get down to your breakfast, or you'll
                            not get any that's what!" And as the reversed cuff he was in the act of
                            buttoning slid from John's wrist and rolled under the dresser, he heard
                            a stiff rustling of starched muslin flouncing past the door, and the
                            quick italicized patter of determined gaiters down the hall.</p>
                        <p>"Look here," said John, to the bright-faced boy in the hotel office, a
                            half hour, later "It seems the house here's been changing hands
                            again."</p>
                        <p>"Yes, sir," said the boy, closing the cigar <pb id="VAA2438-207" n="201"
                            /> case, and handing him a lighted match. "Well, the new landlord,
                            whoever he is," continued John, patronizingly, "is 'a good one.'
                            Leastwise, he knows what's good to eat, and how to serve it."</p>
                        <p>The boy laughed timidly," It ain't a 'landlord,' thoughit's a landlady;
                            it's my mother."</p>
                        <p>"Ah," said John, dallying with the change the boy had pushed toward him.
                            " Your mother, eh? And where's your father?"</p>
                        <p>"He's dead," said the boy.</p>
                        <p>"And what's this for?" abruptly asked John, examining his change.</p>
                        <p>"That's your change," said the boy. "You got three for a quarter, and
                            gave me a 'half.'"</p>
                        <p>"Well, you just keep it," said John, sliding back the change. "It's for
                            good luck, you know, my boy. Same as drinking you long life and
                            prosperity. And Oh, yes, by the way, you may tell your mother I'll have
                            a friend to dinner with me to-day."</p>
                        <p>"Yes, sir, and thank you, sir," said the beaming boy.</p>
                        <p>"Handsome boy," mused John, as he walked down street. "Takes that from
                            his father, though, I'll wager my existence."</p>
                        <p>Upon his office desk, John found a hastily written note. It was addressed
                            in the wellknown <pb id="VAA2438-208" n="202"/> hand of his old chum. He
                            eyed the missive apprehensively, and there was a positive pathos in his
                            voice as he said aloud; "It's our divorce, I feel it!" The note, headed
                            "At the office, 4 in morning," ran like this: <text>
                                <body>

                                        <p>I left you slumbering so soundly that, by noon, when you
                                            waken, I hope, in your refreshed state, you will look
                                            more tolerantly on my intentions as confided to you this
                                            night. I will not see you here again to say good-bye. I
                                            wanted to, but was afraid to "rouse the sleeping lion."
                                            I will not close my eyes to-night fact is I haven't
                                            time. Our serenade at Josie's was a prearranged signal
                                            by which she is to be ready and at the station for the 5
                                            morning train. You may remember the lighting of three
                                            consecutive matches at her window before the igniting of
                                            her lamp. That meant, "Thrice, dearest one, I'll meet
                                            thee at the depot at 4:30 sharp." So, my dear Mack, this
                                            is to inform you that, even as you read, Josie and I
                                            have eloped. It is all the old man's fault, yet I
                                            forgive him. Hope he'll return the favor. Josie predicts
                                            he will inside of a weekor ten days, anyhow. Good-bye,
                                            Mack, old boy, and let a fellow down as easy as you
                                            can.</p>

                        <p>"Heavens!" exclaimed John, stifling the note in his hand and stalking
                            tragically around the room. "Can it be possible that I have nursed a
                            frozen viper? An ingrate? A wolf in sheep's clothing? An ourang-outang
                            in gent's furnishings?"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA2438-209" n="203"/>
                        <p>"Was you callin' me, sir?" asked a voice at the door. It was the
                            janitor.</p>
                        <p>"No!" thundered John; "quit my sight! get out of my way! No, no,
                            Thompson, I don't mean that," he called after him. "Here's a half dollar
                            for you, and I want you to lock up the office, and tell anybody that
                            wants to see me that I've been set upon, and sacked and assassinated in
                            cold blood, and I've fled to my father's in the country, and am lying
                            there in the convulsions of dissolution, babbling of green fields and
                            running brooks, and thirsting for the life of every woman that comes in
                            gun-shot!" And then, more like a confirmed invalid than a man in the
                            strength and pride of his prime, he crept down into the street again,
                            and thence back to his hotel.</p>
                        <p>Dejectedly climbing to his room, he encountered on the landing above a
                            little woman in a jaunty dusting-cap and a trim habit of crisp muslin.
                            He tried to evade her, but in vain. She looked him squarely in the
                            face.</p>
                        <p>"You' re the gentleman in No. 11, I believe?" she said.</p>
                        <p>He nodded confusedly.</p>
                        <p>"Mr. McKinney is your name, I think?" she queried, with a pretty
                            elevation of the eyebrows.</p>
                        <p>"Yes, ma'am," said John rather abjectly. "You see, ma'ambut I beg
                            pardon," he went <pb id="VAA2438-210" n="204"/> on stammeringly, and
                            with a very awkward bow "I beg pardon, but I am addressingah
                            theahthe"</p>
                        <p>"You are addressing the new landlady," she interpolated, pleasantly.
                            "Mrs. Miller is my name. I think we should be friends, Mr. McKinney,
                            since I hear you are one of the oldest patrons of the house."</p>
                        <p>"Thank youthank you!" said John, completely embarrassed. "Yes, indeed!ha,
                            ha. Oh, yesyesreally we must be quite old friends, I assure you,
                            Mrs.Mrs."</p>
                        <p>"Mrs. Miller," smilingly prompted the little woman.</p>
                        <p>"Yes, ah, yes,Mrs. Miller. Lovely morning, Mrs. Miller," said John,
                            edging past her and backing toward his room.</p>
                        <p>But as Mrs. Miller was laughing outright, for some mysterious reason, and
                            gave no affirmative in response to his proposition as to the quality of
                            the weather, John, utterly abashed and nonplused, darted into his room
                            and closed the door.</p>
                        <p>"Deucedly extraordinary woman!" he thought; "wonder what's her idea!"</p>
                        <p>He remained locked in his room till dinner, and when he promptly emerged
                            for that occasion there was a very noticeable improvement in his
                            personal appearance, in point of dress at least, for <pb
                                id="VAA2438-211" n="205"/> there still lingered about his smoothly
                            shaven features a certain haggard, care-worn, anxious look.</p>
                        <p>Next his own place at the table he found a chair tilted forward, as
                            though in reservation for some honored guest. What did it mean? Oh, he
                            remembered now. Told the boy to tell his mother he would have a friend
                            to dine with him. Bert,and, blast the fellow! he was doubtless dining
                            then with a far preferable companionhis wifein a palace car on the P.,
                            C. &amp; St. L., two hundred miles away. The thought was maddening.
                            Of course, now, the landlady would have material for a new assault. And
                            how could he avert it? Dare he meet it? A despairing film blurred his
                            sight for the momentthen the eyes flashed daringly. "I will meet it like
                            a man!" he said mentally" yes, I will invite it! Let her do her
                            worst!"</p>
                        <p>He called a servant, directing some message in an undertone.</p>
                        <p>"Yes, sir," said the agreeable servant, "I'll go right away, sir," and he
                            left the room.</p>
                        <p>Five minutes elapsed, and then a voice at his elbow startled him:</p>
                        <p>"Did you send for me, Mr, McKinney? What is it I can do?"</p>
                        <p>"You are very kind, Mrs.Mrs."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA2438-212" n="206"/>
                        <p>"Mrs. Miller," said the landlady, with a smile that he remembered.</p>
                        <p>"Now, please spare me even the mildest of rebukes. I deserve your
                            censure, but I can't stand itI can't, positively!" and there was a
                            pleading look in John's lifted eyes that changed the little woman's
                            smile to an expression of real solicitude. "I have sent for you,"
                            continued John, "to ask of you three great favors. Please be seated
                            while I enumerate them. FirstI want you to forgive and forget that
                            ill-natured, uncalled-for grumbling of mine this morning when you
                            wakened me."</p>
                        <p>"Why, certainly," said the landlady, again smiling, though quite
                            seriously.</p>
                        <p>"I thank you," said John, with dignity. "And, second," he continued"I
                            want your assurance that my extreme confusion and awkwardness on the
                            occasion of our meeting later were rightly interpreted."</p>
                        <p>"Certainlycertainly," said the landlady, with the kindliest sympathy.</p>
                        <p>"I am gratefulutterly," said John, with newer dignity. "And then," he
                            went on "after informing you that it is impossible for the best friend I
                            have in the world to be with me at this hour, as intended, I want you to
                            do me the very great honor of dining with me. Will you?"</p>
                        <pb id="VAA2438-213" n="207"/>
                        <p>"Why, certainly," said the charming little landlady" and a thousand
                            thanks beside! But tell me something of your friend," she continued, as
                            they were being served: "What is he like and what is his nameand where
                            is he?"</p>
                        <p>"Well," said John, warily" he's like all young fellows of his age. He's
                            quite young, you knownot over thirty, I should saya mere boy, in fact,
                            but clevertalentedversatile."</p>
                        <p>"Unmarried, of course," said the chatty little woman.</p>
                        <p>"Oh, yes," said John, in a matter-of-course tonebut he caught himself
                            abruptly then stared intently at his napkinglanced evasively at the
                            side-face of his questioner, and said," Oh, yes! Yes, indeed! He's
                            unmarried. Old bachelor like myself, you know. Ha! ha!"</p>
                        <p>"So he's not like the young man here that distinguished himself last
                            night?" says the little woman, archly.</p>
                        <p>The fork in John's hand, half-lifted to his lips, faltered, and fell back
                            toward his plate.</p>
                        <p>"Why, what's that?" said John, in a strange voice; "I haven't heard
                            anything about itI mean I haven't heard anything about any young man.
                            What was it?"</p>
                        <p>"Haven't heard anything about the elopement?" exclaimed the little woman
                            in astonishment. <pb id="VAA2438-214" n="208"/> "Why, it's been the talk
                            of the town all morning. Elopement in high lifeson of a grain dealer,
                            name of Hines, or Himes or something, and a preacher's daughterJosie
                            somebody didn't catch her last name. Wonder if you don't know the
                            partiesWhy, Mr. McKinney, are you ill?"</p>
                        <p>"Oh, nonot at all!" said John: "Don't mention it. Haha! Just eating too
                            rapidly, that's all. Go on withyou were saying that Bert and Josie had
                            really eloped."</p>
                        <p>"What Bert?" asked the little woman quickly.</p>
                        <p>"Why, did I say Bert?" says John, with a guilty look. "I meant Haines, of
                            course, you knowHaines and Josie. And did they really elope?"</p>
                        <p>"That's the report," answered the little woman as though deliberating
                            some important evidence; "and they say, too, that the plot of the
                            runaway was quite ingenious. It seems the young lovers were assisted in
                            their flight by some old fellowfriend of the young man'sWhy, Mr.
                            McKinney, you are ill, surely!"</p>
                        <p>John's face was ashen.</p>
                        <p>"Nono!" he gasped painfully: "Go on go on! Tell me more about thethethe
                            old <pb id="VAA2438-215" n="209"/> fellowthe old reprobate! And is he
                            still at large?"</p>
                        <p>"Yes," said the little woman, anxiously regarding the strange demeanor of
                            her companion. "They say, though, that the law can do nothing with him,
                            and that this fact only intensifies the agony of the broken-hearted
                            parentsfor it seems they have, till now, regarded him both as a
                            gentleman and family friend in whom "</p>
                        <p>"I really am ill," moaned John, waveringly rising to his feet; "but I beg
                            you not to be alarmed. Tell your little boy to come to my room, where I
                            will retire at once and send for my physician. It is simply a nervous
                            attack. I am often troubled so, and only perfect quiet and seclusion
                            restores me. You have done me a great honor, Mrs.""Mrs. Miller," sighed
                            the sympathetic little woman" Mrs. Miller,and I thank you more than I
                            have words to express." He bowed limply, turned through a side door
                            opening on a stair, and tottered to his room.</p>
                        <p>During the three weeks of illness through which he passed, John had every
                            attentionmuch more, indeed, than he had consciousness to appreciate. For
                            the most part his mind wandered, and he talked of curious things, and
                                <pb id="VAA2438-216" n="210"/> laughed hysterically, and serenaded
                            mermaids that dwelt in grassy seas of dew, and were bald-headed like
                            himself. He played upon a fourteen-jointed flute of solid gold, with
                            diamond holes, and keys carved out of thawless ice. His old father came
                            at first to take him home; but he could not be moved, the doctor
                            said.</p>
                        <p>Two weeks of John's illness had worn away, when a very serious looking
                            young man, in a travelling duster, and a high hat, came up the stairs to
                            see him. A handsome young lady was clinging to his arm. It was Bert and
                            Josie. She had guessed the very date of their forgiveness. John wakened
                            even clearer in mind than usual that afternoon. He recognized his old
                            chum at a glance, and Josienow Bert's wife. Yes, he comprehended that.
                            He was holding a hand of each when another figure entered. His thin,
                            white fingers loosened their clasp, and he held a hand toward the
                            newcomer. "Here," he said, "is my best friend in the worldBert, you and
                            Josie will love her, I know; for this is Mrs. Mrs.""Mrs. Miller," said
                            the radiant little woman."Yes, Mrs. Miller," said John, very
                            proudly.</p>
