            <p>The historical community, and especially historians of Indiana, suffered a profound loss with the
                    passing on December 16, 1994, of Emma Lou Thornbrough. A native of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Dr. Thornbrough was a graduate of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, where she received both B.A. and M.A. degrees. She went on to earn a Ph.D.
                    at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> in 1946. That same year she accepted a position in the Department of History at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where she taught until her retirement in 1983. During her career she also held
                    visiting appointments at Indiana University and Case—Western Reserve University.</p>
            <p>Her dedication to learning and to her students was a hallmark of Emma Lou Thornbrough'
                    distinguished career. Not only did she teach courses on American constitutional history,
                    African-American history, and the history of the American South, she also demonstrated her
                    intellectual breadth by offering courses on Greek and Roman civilizations. In her last year at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Professor Thornbrough played a leading role in launching a new interdisciplinary
                    comparative world cultures course in the core curriculum, a mark of her innovative spirit and her
                    commitment to liberal education. She received many honors during her tenure at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, including the Outstanding Professor Award in 1965 and appointment in 1981 to the
                    McGregor Chair in History. In 1988 the university awarded her an honorary doctorate.</p>
            <p>Emma Lou' reputation as a historian of Indiana rests principally on two books: <hi rend="i">The Negro in Indiana before 1900</hi> (1957) and <hi rend="i">Indiana in the Civil War Era</hi>
                    (1965). The former, a truly path-breaking state-level monograph, remains a touchstone for those
                    studying the experiences of African Americans in Indiana. (The recent reissue of the book by Indiana
                    University Press attests to the soundness of its scholarship and its continuing value.) <hi rend="i">Indiana in the Civil War Era</hi>, a volume in The History of Indiana series, also remains in

                    questions relating to the "middle period" of the state'
                    nineteenth-century history. Several other of her publications (see accompanying bibliography) also
                    illuminate aspects of the Hoosier state' past. At the time of her death she was working on
                    a history of African Americans in twentieth-century Indiana.</p>
            <p>Dr. Thornbrough was an exemplar not only in her role as teacher/scholar but also as an
                    "engaged" academic. Her interest in <placeName>

                    </placeName> constitutional history and in African-American history grew out of her conviction that
                    race has been a central force throughout the nation' development, and she applied what she
                    learned in her research and teaching to contemporary issues in race relations and civil rights in
                    Indiana. Her lifelong commitment to the civil rights struggle is witnessed by her recent research on
                    the desegregation of public schools in <placeName>

            <p>But Emma Lou Thornbrough' engagement in the community extended beyond her scholarship and
                    teaching. She was active in each of the following organizations, many of which she served as an
                    officer or board member: Organization of American Historians; Southern Historical Association;
                    Indiana Historical Society; Indiana Association of Historians; Indiana Alpha Association of Phi Beta

                    the historical profession by both Emma Lou and her sister Gayle.</p>
            <p>The breadth and depth of Emma Lou' historical knowledge was complemented by her eclectic
                    interests. She was, in the words of one friend, an "intense" gardener who
                    transformed her backyard into an oasis of color and fragrance. She and Gayle traveled widely in
                    Europe, and she took special pleasure in attending the theater in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Her friends and acquaintances can attest to the knowledge and conviction she brought
                    to discussions of current events.</p>
            <p>Emma Lou Thornbrough will be missed, but she has left her mark on friends, colleagues, and students.
                    And she leaves a legacy of historical scholarship that will enrich those interested in the past of
                    her native state for years to come.</p>

            <p>Recent participants in the American culture wars have boldly declared the need for a
                    "return" to narrative history. Their assumption, a curious one in my view, seems
                    to be that narrative history displays a commitment to "objective truth" and that
                    thematic social history does not. I am aware of no successful attempt at arguing these points.
                    Furthermore, the claim betrays a failure of historical memory, or at least a failure to understand
                    how a related controversy was played out by an earlier generation. At the beginning of this century
                    an heuristic distinction was drawn between historians possessed of a literary bent, those who were
                    concerned with narrative, and "scientific" historians, who were concerned with the
                    objective presentation of empirical evidence. Historians of the literary temperament attempted to
                    define the American national epic, often in the form of a conceptually innovative and rhetorically
                    compelling narrative. Scientific historians, for the most part, eschewed grand theories and moral
                    preachments and were concerned with the systematic introduction of evidence in order, as Leopold von
                    Ranke had put it, to relate history <hi rend="i">"wie es eigentlich gewesen
                    ist,"</hi> or "as it actually was."</p>
            <p>Things were, of course, never so simple. Henry Adams knew that the very idea of scientific history
                    contained a paradox that derived from competing ideas of what constitutes science—in
                    particular, social science. The notion of scientific history developed as much from the sweeping
                    sociological imagination of Auguste Comte as it did from the patient incrementalism of the Rankeans.
                    It should not be surprising, therefore, that from its inception American social history, despite its
                    rootedness in description and analysis and regardless of its methodological devotion to the
                    incremental accumulation of minute data, should be infused with an evolutionary metaphysic.
                    Scientific history was "progressive" in the sense denoted by Herbert Butterfield
                    and later expanded by Richard Hofstadter. The derivation of social history, old and new, from the
                    progressive <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="5" id="VAA4025-091-1-011"/> genealogy of Comte and Adams is clear, since American social
                    history almost invariably reveals a confidence in the inevitable march of reason through the gradual
                    unveiling of truth toward the amelioration of irrationality, superstition, and injustice in human
                    affairs. In such fashion is the perfectionist strain in American life complemented by the
                    progressivist strain in American historiography.</p>
            <p>Two of the most impressive examples of the scientific-progressive school in the field of
                    African-American history have been John Hope Franklin' <hi rend="i">The Free Negro in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> (1943) and Emma Lou Thornbrough' <hi rend="i">The Negro in
                    Indiana</hi> (1963). Both were produced by scholars who were scientific historians in method and
                    progressive historians in ideology. History, especially African-American history, would be a dismal
                    science if its goal were no more than the charting of random victories and defeats. <hi rend="i">The
                        Negro In Indiana</hi> would be a depressing book were it not for its underlying current of
                    implicit optimism. Like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>' <hi rend="i">Free Negro in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi>, it is one of those meticulous volumes that fully documents what common sense
                    and popular legend have always told us, that African Americans have encountered much hardship along
                    the road "from slavery to freedom."</p>
            <p>Thornbrough was a progressive historian by temperament. She impressed me as such on the only occasion
                    we ever met. It was at a session of the Popular Culture Association in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where she introduced herself to me after my presentation on a panel. I perceived her
                    as a straightforward, generous-spirited woman, unexcitable, eager to teach and to learn. I never
                    doubted the nature of her sympathies, which are obvious on every page of <hi rend="i">The Negro in
                        Indiana.</hi> When Thornbrough describes, in her preface, "the discrimination and
                    indignities" heaped upon the black population or "the gradual and uneven progress
                    of the Negro minority toward equality" (p. x), we know that she perceives racial
                    discrimination as a violation of morality and common sense. To her credit she seems, at times,
                    almost incapable of conceiving how this self-evident truth could not be obvious to everyone.</p>
            <p>The early chapters of <hi rend="i">The Negro in Indiana</hi> deal with the arrival of African
                    Americans in the state as slaves and indentured servants and with the movement to exclude all
                    Negroes, whether slave or free. Antislavery in Indiana, as in many of the free states, reflected the
                    hostility of free whites toward competition with slave labor as well as a fundamental prejudice
                    against black people. Slavery failed to take root in Indiana, we may assume, for the same
                    reasons—economic and legal—that it failed in the rest of the Midwest. As
                    slavery and indentured servitude were outlawed, attempts were made toward the complete exclusion of
                    all black people from the state, and those free Negroes who did arrive were encouraged to leave.</p>
            <pb n="6" id="VAA4025-091-1-012"/>
            <p>Exclusionists argued that the people of Indiana would be "recreant to their best interests
                    and greatest duties to posterity, if they supinely continue to permit the migration of free negroes
                    to the state. The dregs of offscourings of the slave states are most likely to change residence, and
                    they are too incurably affected with that horrible gangrene of morals which slavery engenders, to be
                    welcome among a virtuous and intelligent people" (quoted, p. 57-58). In short, in the
                    interest of progress black people should not be allowed into Indiana. This position was mild in
                    comparison to the opinion of one gentleman who, speaking before the legislature, maintained that
                    "in all sincerity, and without any hard feelings towards them [the free Negroes]-that it
                    would be better to kill them off at once, if there is no other way to get rid of them….
                    we know how the Puritans did with the Indians, who were infinitely more magnanimous and less
                    impudent than this colored race …." (quoted, p. 66-67).</p>
            <p>Indianans also gave widespread support to the American Colonization Society despite the fact that
                    African Americans showed little interest in migrating to Africa. As was true in other free states,
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> community constituted the most prominent white group that consistently opposed not only
                    slavery but discriminatory legislation. The Constitution of 1851 provided, in its notorious Article
                    XIII, that "No Negro or mulatto shall come into, or settle in the State, after the adoption
                    of this Constitution." While most whites in Indiana supported the provision, an
                    abolitionist minority protested it. The law turned out, in the long run, to be ineffective; but
                    although it was never systematically enforced, attempts at its repeal were unsuccessful.</p>
            <p>Thornbrough' discussion of African-American politics after emancipation is one of the books
                    most interesting features. Indiana was one of the states in which African Americans began quite
                    early to resent the Republican monopoly of their votes. Throughout the Reconstruction period most
                    black leaders subscribed to Frederick Douglass' dictum, "The Republican Party is
                    the ship; all else is the sea." The challenge to Republican orthodoxy came largely from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Freeman</hi>, which began publication in 1888 with Edward E. Cooper as its editor. The
                        <hi rend="i">Freeman</hi>, Thornbrough notes, "tried to show that although the
                    Republicans could not carry the state without Negro votes, they were ingrates who did not give the
                    Negroes the rewards they deserved" (p. 303). Black Indianans were denied a voice in the
                    national Republican party and were also ignored in local municipal affairs. In the presidential
                    campaign of 1888 the <hi rend="i">Freeman</hi> supported the reelection of Grover <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, acknowledged even by Douglass to be an honorable and fair man. The <hi rend="i">Freeman</hi> retained its association with the Democratic party until 1892, when it was
                    purchased by the black Republican leader George L. Knox.</p>
            <pb n="7" id="VAA4025-091-1-013"/>
            <p>As a scientific historian focusing on the nineteenth century, Thornbrough was obliged to relate a
                    series of verifiable facts regardless of their unpleasantness, just "as they actually
                    were," but the conclusions she reached were reasonably optimistic. She viewed the years
                    between the Civil War and the turn of the century as "a period of substantial, if uneven,
                    progress" in Indiana. While black Americans were not always treated with full equality,
                    they were recognized as equal before the law. "While the adoption of the Fifteenth
                    Amendment was bitterly resisted, once political rights were granted there was never any movement to
                    take them away" (p. 391). She notes the rise of Ku Klux Klan activity in the 1920s and
                    describes the lynching of two Negro youths in 1930. Having confessed to killing a white man and
                    assaulting his female companion, they were taken by a mob from the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Grant County</region>
                    </placeName> jail and hanged. Most of the population of Indiana in 1963 would have been startled,
                    she asserts, "to know that a lynching had occurred in the state so recently" (p.
                    393). Thornbrough makes no mention of the fact that interracial marriage was still prohibited by
                    Indiana law at the time her book was published.</p>
            <p>True to the progressive tradition, Thornbrough was confident of the power of facts, simply presented,
                    to overcome ignorance and of the power of science to defeat racial superstition. Her scientific
                    history, therefore, aspired to something beyond the modest pretensions of apolitical Rankeanism. It
                    was more akin to the scientific teleology of Comte. Civil rights were destined to triumph because
                    intolerance is fundamentally irrational. The fact that she allowed the facts to speak for themselves
                    did not imply an apolitical attitude, only a methodological integrity. She believed, as did the best
                    historians of her generation, that monstrous and irrational dogmas were ultimately doomed by the
                    progress of science. She gave every indication of having accepted the fundamental tenet of
                    progressivism that no democratically conceived society could permanently allow itself to be governed
                    by an ethos that was essentially irrational, hence unjust.</p>
            <p>Around 1970, when the black studies publishing boom was heating up and academic presses were
                    attempting to meet the demand for "books to set the record straight," I somehow
                    got hold of Thornbrough' tidy little reader, <hi rend="i">Booker T. Washington</hi> (1969),
                    which was issued in the Prentice-Hall series Great Lives Observed. It is a collection of some of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>' representative speeches bound together with memorable responses from his
                    contemporaries overlapped by several historical appraisals, including those of Carter G. Woodson,
                    Langston Hughes, August Meier, and Louis R. Harlan. It is gratifying to see how well
                    Thornbrough' collection has stood the test of time, for there have been surprisingly few
                    attempts at reappraising Booker T. Washington in the past quarter century. Certainly his
                    complexities are seldom appreciated, and it is difficult <pb n="8" id="VAA4025-091-1-014"/> to
                    interest present-day students in getting to know him. I still consider Thornbrough' text
                    useful for graduate and undergraduate courses. A good teaching tool does not go out of date in a
                    mere quarter century.</p>
            <p>But while an anthology must be a good teaching tool, it should also justify itself in terms of its
                    theory of history and its theory of the teaching of history. Consumers should be able to count on an
                    accessible, evenhanded introduction to the author in question, but any instructor who plans to
                    assign such a text will always hunger for something more than a simple presentation of the facts and
                    documents. By the process of selection and, of course, in the introduction they provide, editors
                    have an obligation to teach. They must present a body of material in such a way as to reveal to the
                    reader why they consider these materials important. In the process they will tell us much about
                    their theory of history and about their philosophy of life. Thornbrough' introduction to
                        <hi rend="i">Booker T. Washington</hi> is a model of its genre, objective and balanced yet
                    offering an interpretation with a touch that is characteristically light and subtle.</p>
            <p>"To understand a man it is necessary to know something of the times in which he
                    lived," she tells us in the introduction (p. 1). This is more than a statement of the
                    obvious. Like W. E. B. Du Bois, she recognized the fact that any useful treatment of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> must place him within the context of American economic culture. In her opening
                    paragraph she therefore outlined the <hi rend="i">Zeitgeist</hi> of the "Gilded
                    Age," highlighting the major personalities and events that gave the period its character in
                    that age of excess. While Thornbrough was not inclined to make excuses for the policies of the
                    Tuskegee Machine, she recognized, as did Du Bois, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>' genius at catching "the thought and speech of triumphant
                    commercialism." His behavior was not simply a matter of slavish compliance with the
                    dictates of power, it was a brilliant, albeit tragically doomed, attempt to alter the course of a
                    power that was beyond all hope of control.</p>
            <p>Unhappy discoveries that I have made in my recent dealings with textbook editors lead me to fear that
                    such a volume as Thornbrough' <hi rend="i">Booker T. Washington</hi> would not make it
                    through the editorial process at some publishing houses today. Thornbrough made an assumption, which
                    was perhaps more reasonable in 1972 than it is today, that intelligent students and teachers were
                    alike capable of understanding a college level presentation of historical documents. She obviously
                    expected that the text would be administered by a mature, dedicated teacher with a knowledge of the
                    general contours of American history. She assumed that an instructor would take the time to define
                    such terms as "Gilded Age" and explain the representatives of that age,
                    "men like Rockefeller, and Carnegie [who] were free to exercise their entrepreneurial and
                    acquisitive talents without interference from government" (p. 1).</p>
            <pb n="9" id="VAA4025-091-1-015"/>
            <p>She assumed, furthermore, that a competent teacher would have sufficient imagination to follow her
                    suggestions about placing <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> within the context of cultural studies. Her text alludes to the once popular myth of
                    Horatio Alger, assuming that students would want to know and that teachers would be happy to explain
                    who Alger was. The introduction briefly mentions that element of primary importance in the
                    intellectual history of the period, "social Darwinism," and its effects on
                    segregationist thought before going on to sketch the background of <hi rend="i">Plessy v
                    Ferguson.</hi> Thornbrough evinced her progressive optimism by assuming that students and teachers
                    would display sufficient curiosity and initiative to make their way across the intellectual terrain
                    once she pointed out the landmarks.</p>
            <p>Thornbrough' objectivity and authoritative knowledge of the late nineteenth and early
                    twentieth centuries made her an obvious choice to write the article on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of American Negro Biography</hi> (DANB). Thornbrough, as
                    much as anyone, was responsible for the reappraisal of turn-of-the-century black leadership that is
                    still occurring in American historiography. Along with Meier and Harlan she led us to an
                    understanding of the complexities of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>' behavior and the subtle workings of his Tuskegee Machine. While, on the one
                    hand, it is evident that Thornbrough was no defender of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it is equally obvious that she respected him. I think her work marked a departure from
                    the position of other progressive scholars, notably Rayford W. Logan and J. Saunders Redding, who
                    could barely mention Washington' name without a sneer.</p>
            <p>If Thornbrough was a good choice to write the article on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> for the DANB, she was the best choice to write the article on T. Thomas Fortune. As
                    author of <hi rend="i">T. Thomas Fortune, Militant Journalist</hi>, she had long been immersed in
                    her subject. Her study of the militant journalist had obliged her to wade into areas of American
                    history more obscure than the relatively straightforward court reporting that had dominated her
                    earlier work. Fortune' brilliant but unstable character and the apparent contradictions in
                    his political philosophy made him an intriguing subject. Thornbrough' attempt to make sense
                    of Fortune' life inevitably resulted in a more interesting project, in this
                    reader' view, than the masterful, but unadventurous, archival reporting of <hi rend="i">The
                        Negro in Indiana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fortune was born in Marianna, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1856, the child of former slaves with appreciable white and Indian ancestry. Though
                    the photograph that appears as frontispiece to Thornbrough' biography provides no clue of
                    his African ancestry, other photographs are more revealing. Born in a time and place when one drop
                    of Negro blood was sufficient to predetermine one' fixed place within the racial caste
                    system, Fortune was always known as a "black man," and his life was dedicated to
                    uncompromising struggle <pb n="10" id="VAA4025-091-1-016"/> against racial oppression. While he was
                    in his early teens, Fortune' parents moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jacksonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There he briefly attended the Stanton Academy, where he was instructed by two women
                    from New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. During these years he held various jobs, including one as printers devil for the
                    Jackson <hi rend="i">Daily Union.</hi> By the time he left the deep South, still in his teens,
                    Fortune had become an expert compositor and had learned the rudiments of the newspaper business.</p>
            <p>Fortune entered the preparatory department of Howard University in 1874 with less than three years of
                    formal schooling. He soon rebelled against the discipline of the university, including what he
                    identified as a spirit of religious hypocrisy, but he respected several of the teachers greatly and
                    expressed continuing admiration for Dean of the Law School John Mercer Langston. Fortune'
                    career at Howard came to an abrupt end when he lost all the savings that were to have seen him
                    through the university in one of the periodic bank failures that characterized the era. He then went
                    to work for <hi rend="i">The Peoples Advocate</hi>, a black newspaper recently established by John
                    Wesley Cromwell in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D.C. Fortune later founded other newspapers of his own, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Globe</hi> and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Freeman</hi>, the latter of which changed its name to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Age.</hi> He ended his career in journalism at the <hi rend="i">Negro World</hi>, a
                    publication of Marcus Garvey' Universal Negro Improvement Association, where he was editor
                    until his death in 1928.</p>
            <p>Thornbrough had earlier treated Fortune as a civil rights activist in her article, "The
                    National Afro-American League, 1887-1908," which appeared in the <hi rend="i">Journal of
                        Southern History</hi> (November, 1961). Fortune organized the Afro-American League, later called
                    the Afro-American Council, to protest against a list of six grievances: the suppression of voting
                    rights, "the universal and lamentable reign of lynch law," the inequity in the
                    distribution of school funds, "the odious and demoralizing penitentiary system of the
                    South," discrimination on the railroads, and denial of hotel and theater accommodations. In
                    many respects the league was, as Thornbrough noted, a precursor of the Niagara Movement and the
                    National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), although, at least at the
                    beginning, it employed a far more militant rhetoric than the NAACP. "We propose to
                    accomplish our purpose," the league asserted, "by the peaceful methods of
                    agitation, through the ballot and the courts, but if others use the weapons of violence to combat
                    our peaceful arguments it is not for us to run away from violence" (p. 496).</p>
            <p>White moderates and conservatives viewed Fortune as a dangerous agitator and a racial chauvinist.
                    Some of Fortune' black contemporaries accepted his militancy as a necessary complement to
                    Washington' accommodationism. Militant blacks saw him as Washington' puppet and a
                    traitor to the race. Thornbrough sifted <pb n="11" id="VAA4025-091-1-017"/> through the various and
                    contradictory contemporary opinions, finally portraying Fortune as the more militant voice of
                    Washington' Tuskegee Machine. Fortune was, in fact, no less militant than William Monroe
                    Trotter or other elements of the Niagara Movement, including Du Bois. Certain features of
                    Fortune' personality, including his perennial drinking problem, alienated the journalist
                    from the cold-water puritanism of the Niagara leadership. Thornbrough, however, does not miss the
                    paradox that militant integrationists, such as Fortune and Victoria Earle Matthews, were more than
                    tolerated within the Tuskegee Machine.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to imagine a greater difference in personalities than that between the precocious,
                    unstable Fortune and the scientific, reliable Thornbrough, yet the biographer demonstrated
                    remarkable sympathy with and respect for her subject. Further, she significantly elevated our
                    understanding of the relationship between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the educated classes of African Americans, particularly that between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Fortune and between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Du Bois. It is generally known today that Du Bois praised <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>' <placeName>

                    </placeName> Exposition address and defended Tuskegee from criticism, but Thornbrough was among the
                    first to bring such facts to light.</p>
            <p>We now know that just as Du Bois never undervalued the self-help aspects of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>' strategy, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> never overlooked ways to exploit the militancy of Du Bois and others. Fortune
                    represented a group of relatively militant black persons, including the Grimkè brothers
                    and Mary Church Terrell, who were able to work with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> far more effectively than could Du Bois, and Thornbrough believes that Fortune did not
                    find it necessary to compromise his principles in order to do so. If Fortune was compromised, it was
                    not by Washington so much as by his emotional problems and alcohol dependency. Despite the
                    journalist' continuing drinking problem, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, either from necessity or from genuine feelings of friendship, consistently supported
                    him. Fortune, for his part, seems to have had genuine ideological reasons for supporting <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Thornbrough, in explaining the strange relationship between the two men, quotes
                    Fortune to good effect: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Perhaps in the history of mankind more victories have been won through the policy of
                            conservatism and moderation pursued by Mr. Washington than through the radical and unbending
                            policy I have always pursued; but it is the temperament of the two of us, and we can neither
                            of us change our nature.</p>
                        <p>I naturally regard Mr. Washington as the strongest and safest leader we have (<hi rend="i">Booker T. Washington</hi>, p. 112).</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>Thornbrough was not overly sympathetic to the gradualism she associated with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and it would be far from the mark to describe her as a Tuskegee apologist. On the
                    other hand there is some understandable ambivalence in her treatment of the relationship between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Fortune. She seems convinced that <pb n="12" id="VAA4025-091-1-018"/>
                    <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> had an affectionate regard for Fortune as well as a genuine respect for his abilities.
                    She never accuses <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> of predatory exploitation of Fortune and reports no vindictiveness after the
                    relationship went sour. At one point she accuses <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> of using the journalist until it no longer seemed advantageous to do so. On the other
                    hand, as she adequately demonstrates, Fortune, like most alcoholics, did an excellent job of
                    alienating even his closest friends and family.</p>
            <p>It does not seem that the Tuskegee Machine was unfeeling toward Fortune, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>' principal lieutenant, Emmett Scott, continued to loan Fortune money while he
                    was experiencing his worst "years of degredation." Washington was several times
                    willing to forgive embarrassment resulting from Fortune' unsteadiness, although he was most
                    likely to help when the journalist showed signs of coping with his problems. Fortune, for his part,
                    seemed ideologically committed to the Tuskegee philosophy. He consistently sided with the machine in
                    its war with the NAACP, expressing in letters to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> his contempt for an organization that was controlled by white liberals. In later years,
                    during his Garvey phase, he seemed convinced that black organizations must draw their power to
                    inspire from the masses. This, he said, was something that Garvey had been able to do in a way that
                    neither the NAACP nor Tuskegee nor, as he admitted, his own Afro-American League had been able to
                    do.</p>
            <p>Thornbrough' commentary on the Tuskegee Machine, seen from the perspective of Fortune,
                    provides extraordinary insight into the period that Meier has dubbed "the Age of Booker T.
                    Washington." When one reflects on much that had been said and written about the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> years in earlier treatments, one must admire the evenhandedness of her work. Produced
                    by such progressive historians as Logan, Redding, and Lerone Bennett, many of these works had dealt
                    with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a betrayer of the Negro, a man whose <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName> Compromise had provided consolation to the Supreme Court for its <hi rend="i">Plessy v
                        Ferguson</hi> decision. Thornbrough does not drag out any clichès to the effect that
                    Washington did the best he could under his particular circumstances. That question, particularly in
                    view of the militancy of Fortune, remains, for her, an open one. But she never loses sight of a fact
                    that had been earlier developed by Meier, that Washington' dealings with the talented tenth
                    were far more complex than generally acknowledged in scholarship before the 1960s.</p>
            <p>Thornbrough' work was always characterized by purity of style, meticulous attention to
                    detail, and straightforward presentation of the facts. Many will perceive her biography of Fortune
                    as her best work because she managed, without abandoning her usual no-nonsense approach, to unveil
                    the problematics and ambiguities of "the Age of Booker T. Washington." She
                    demonstrated a respect for <pb n="13" id="VAA4025-091-1-019"/> the complexities of African-American
                    leadership, which cannot be reduced to two-sided controversies. While her work on the Negro in
                    Indiana was a sterling example of honest, descriptive history, her Fortune biography was
                    pathbreaking. It heightened contradictions, revealed paradox, and contributed to the reappraisal of
                    a period. There was never anything contrived about Thornbrough' work, nothing faddish or
                    gimmicky. She never abandoned clarity, and while she respected ambivalence as an essential feature
                    of the human condition, there was no ambivalence in her commitment to equality of opportunity for
                    all Americans. She was uncompromisingly an advocate, in all her work, for the complete participation
                    of the African-American people in every aspect of American democracy.</p>

            <p>It was at the Indiana Association of History conference a year or so ago that I first met Emma Lou
                    Thornbrough. As a graduate student studying the African-American community in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, I had gone to the conference hoping to ask Professor Thornbrough a question or two. I
                    rehearsed what I would say to her, and by the day of the conference I felt fairly confident that I
                    would not appear to be a stuttering admirer. All my preparations were for naught, for as I rounded
                    the corner leading to the main ballroom I found myself face-to-face with the Thornbrough sisters. I
                    began my soliloquy, stuttering despite my rehearsed speech. I fear I made no logical sense.
                    Professor Thornbrough cut me short, thankfully, and told me to make an appointment to visit her at
                    home where we could talk. It seemed to me that I should write my questions before the visit.</p>
            <p>What followed was an example of the "old school" practice where the student sat at
                    the foot of the teacher and listened. I was not one of Professor Thornbrough' students. She
                    was not on my dissertation committee, nor was she an informal reader. I was a graduate student who
                    sought her out, and she responded by sharing with me her insight on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Again, all of my questions seemed inadequate. I had written them this time, but as the
                    conversation spun, it seemed as if I were in a classroom taking notes. Without benefit of reference
                    materials or notes Professor Thornbrough told me of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>' chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
                    the consequences of housing restrictions, and the efforts to construct and then demolish school
                    segregation in the Hoosier capital. On the last point her help was most appreciated. It was at that
                    meeting that I learned that Professor Thornbrough had written a lengthy treatise on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> school desegregation process. She told me, quite firmly, to locate the work at the
                    Indiana Historical Society (IHS) and read it thoroughly. I left her home and went directly to the
                    IHS.</p>
            <p>For the next two weeks I was the favored child of the IHS staff. Instead of going to the reference

                    gave that same item back to them at the end of the day. I heard their whispered conversations when
                    the desk staff was relieved, "There' Pierce. He still has Thornbrough'
                    manuscript." <hi rend="i">The <placeName>

                    length and breadth of her career. She had given the manuscript to the IHS in 1992, and it showed
                    that despite her retirement, Thornbrough remained an active scholar.</p>
            <p>All of us who work on Indiana history owe a debt of gratitude to Professor Thornbrough. She worked in
                    a field that was not at the time she began her career popular among historians, and she produced
                    work that has lasting merit. Before meeting her I had often silently offered my gratefulness. In
                    person I offered it again. Now, thanks to this special issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of

            <p>In 1835 a twenty-seven-year-old English shoemaker named Samuel Fowler Smith left his native Yorkshire
                    village of Walton and settled in Indiana, first as a shoemaker in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Thousands of other English immigrants also came to the Hoosier state during the
                    nineteenth century, but Smith is especially worthy of attention because he played an important role
                    in Indiana' industrial history and because he seems to have been, in many ways, a
                    "typical" English immigrant, thus a good "representative case"
                    for close study. What makes his story possible to tell in detail is his unpublished autobiography,
                    which is rich with an Englishman' descriptions of his new home as well as of his
                        homeland.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Through this personal account and additional sources in <placeName>

                    that the English impact on the Hoosier state was far greater than these comparatively modest numbers
                    would suggest. Long before Indiana' statehood the English were among the first white people
                    in the region, and they were prominently represented among Indiana' pioneers and early
                    religious and political leaders. Many were known for introducing advanced agricultural methods, for
                    being expert miners, or for bringing important industrial technology and skills from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, the first industrial nation. Because they shared a common language and political and
                    cultural heritage with most Americans, the English were also quicker than other immigrant groups to
                    assimilate and interact with American-born Hoosiers in civic and social affairs.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Considering the importance of English immigrants to Indiana, it is surprising that historians have
                    paid such scant attention to them, either as individuals or as a group. John E. Iglehart'
                    lengthy account of an early English colony in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh County</region>
                    </placeName> and John Poucher' brief account of an English colony in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Floyd County</region>
                    </placeName>, both published in early issues of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>,
                    are notable exceptions.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Because these studies are based on the memories of the
                    immigrants themselves and of their children, they have a depth and intimacy that reveal much about
                    the world of early English colonies in the Hoosier state. However, only a small percentage of
                    English immigrants in Indiana formed such "colonies," and these two studies also
                    have the serious limitation of paying virtually no attention to the immigrants’
                    background in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, which is half of their story. As Frank Thistlethwaite pointed out in a now famous
                    article published in 1960, immigrants can be understood only by viewing them before and after their
                    migration, by treating "the process of migration as a complete sequence of experiences
                    whereby the individual moves from one social identity to another."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                    Samuel Smith' history invites the kind of analysis that Thistlethwaite called for.
                    Smith' social, economic, and cultural circumstances in his native village; his growing
                    awareness of an alternative life in the New World; his thoughts, painful adjustments, victories, and

            <p>One cannot assume, of course, that Smith accurately represents all or even most of the English
                    immigrants of his generation. The English in Indiana came from a variety of places within <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and had disparate levels of skills and means. Surely not many became as successful as
                    Smith did. In many ways, however, Smith was as typical as any other English immigrant in Indiana at
                    this time. He came from Yorkshire, the most common county of origin of English immigrants in the
                    Hoosier state. Like most of his fellow English immigrants he had very limited means and had a skill
                    in addition to some farming experience. Also, he based his decision to emigrate on the rather bleak
                    future he saw for himself in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and the better life he knew awaited him in Indiana as was related to him by one brother
                    who was already in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. As was true of many of the other immigrants of the nineteenth century, Smith was in
                    effect a link in the "chain migration," reliant upon valuable help and advice from
                    people he could trust. Finally, Smith was typical for having a deep religious faith. A devout
                    Methodist in Yorkshire and in Indiana before becoming a leading member of the Second Presbyterian
                    Church of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Smith was very active in his church and took the Bible and Sunday preaching very
                        seriously.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Smith himself turned down a chance to remain in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and become a preacher, and as he looked back on a life that succeeded beyond his
                    wildest dreams, he drew the startling conclusion, "I made a mistake in the course I took
                    … I missed my way and made a wrong choice." As a businessman he suffered some
                    consequences for his faith-centered life when he rather naïvely chose his business
                    partners not for their abilities and working habits but for their faithful church attendance and
                    personal piety. Barring this last trait, however, many of Smith' experiences and general
                    characteristics were common among the English immigrants of the pre—Civil War era.</p>
            <p>To understand Smith and his decision to migrate to Indiana one must consider his background in
                    Walton, a typically quaint Yorkshire village about ten miles southwest of the great cathedral city
                    of York. Walton has a very long and rich history—even by English standards. Its name
                    comes from "Wale-tun," or "village of the Welsh," a reference to
                    its traditional origin as a place where the ancient Britons had maintained a settlement despite the
                    successful Roman invasions of the first century and the establishment of their <list type="footnotes">

                    and during the medieval period it had ecclesiastical ties with York. St. Peter' Church,
                    which sits majestically across the street from where Smith was born and raised and in which he was
                    baptized in January of 1809, dates from the twelfth century. A few miles to the east lies Marston
                    Moor, where Sir Thomas Fairfax (whose grand house still stands in Walton) teamed up with Oliver
                    Cromwell in 1644 to defeat King Charles I' troops in the greatest battle of the English
                    Civil War. Smith' appreciation for his local history is evident in his autobiography, as is
                    his deep love for Walton. He would recognize much of Walton if he could visit it today. Though
                    modern changes have of course occurred, the church and many of the houses and cottages remain in a
                    pleasant pastoral setting, and Smith might again have said, "The old village …
                    seemed the most lovely spot upon earth, and it was like tearing heart strings to leave it."</p>
            <p>Smith' social and economic background helps explain his emigration. His father, also Samuel,
                    was "well read" and one of the leading citizens of the village. In addition to
                    being the village schoolmaster, as he was described in the 1841 census manuscripts,<hi rend="sup">8</hi> he was also the village shopkeeper and a tenant farmer of about fifty acres. The elder Smith
                    also had a busy life as parish clerk for St. Peter' Church and, apparently without any
                    sense of conflict, leader for the local Methodists, who met in his house directly opposite St.
                    Peter'. This busy and religious environment helps explain the younger Samuel
                    Smith' drive to achieve economic success as well as his sense of calling to the
                    ministry—two very different paths in life. Despite their local prominence, however, the
                    Smith family suffered economic hardship from time to time. Disease plagued their livestock and
                    crops, their small shop was sometimes a drain on their meager resources, and at times they were
                    unable to pay the rent on their house.</p>
            <p>Smith recounts these various early hardships and other life-forming trials (including the time when
                    his cousin nearly seduced him). During his seven years as a shoemaker' apprentice in nearby
                    Tadcaster, he faced tradition-bound limitations, including a prejudice against booklearning for
                    apprentices, which frustrated his ambitions and cultivated an early interest in emigration to
                    America. The Smiths could hardly have escaped hearing about the New World because many of the people
                    in this corner of Yorkshire were opting to emigrate to the <placeName>

                    period of relative agricultural depression, an adverse circumstance for young skilled artisans like
                    Smith who needed a prosperous agricultural population for their own survival, especially when they

                    hardship and distress but apparently more a determination to fulfill ambitions and make the most of
                    his life. As he recalled, "while working in the shoe shop I felt that I was capable of
                    something better; and yet I could see nothing better before me there." These statements
                    were echoed by so many of the other English immigrants who entered America during the
                    pre—Civil War era.</p>
            <p>Smith certainly was "capable of something better," as were most of the other
                    Yorkshire people who left for Indiana and other states during the nineteenth century. He had
                    capabilities and sensibilities that distinguished him from most of the folk who stayed behind in
                    Britain. For example, he was, by his own account, a "voracious reader," a lover of
                    poetry and nature, and he had a drive and intelligence that did not characterize all of the
                    Yorkshiremen of his class. Smith is a good example of the fact that English emigrants were often
                    those with skills and some education as well as considerable ambition and drive—enough to
                    endure the physical and psychological rigors of uprooting themselves and taking a long and arduous
                    voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. The frequent complaints in Britain' Parliament that the
                    "best" of <placeName>

                    benefited from receiving such people.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having made the decision to emigrate, Smith had to find the means to go, as well as a way to overcome
                    the guilt he felt about leaving his aging parents. The first problem was rather easily solved: after
                    working near Leeds for a couple of years, he accepted an offer to go back to Tadcaster and manage
                    the shop of his old master, Thomas Lockwood, and thus was able to accumulate about one hundred
                    pounds by the time of his emigration. The second was far harder. His parting became a
                    "terrible ordeal," the likes of which were all too familiar to so many emigrants
                    of this period. Smith' vivid retelling of the agony of his departure from his family serves
                    as a good reminder of how emotionally painful emigration could be.</p>
            <p>If Smith' English world of the 1830s was in many ways static, unchanging, and economically
                    stagnant, the one he entered in Indiana was changing and developing at a bewildering pace.
                    Indiana' population jumped from a third of a million in 1830 to over two-thirds of a
                    million just ten years later. By 1850 the population stood at just under one million.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> A market economy was developing in <list type="footnotes">

                    complete with storms so severe that he had to lash himself to the deck while he fully expected to

                    </placeName> on November 3, 1835. The <hi rend="i">Elisha Dennison</hi>' passenger list
                    indicates that it was a small ship of only 359 tons and that Smith had only seventy-two fellow
                    passengers—eighteen Irish, one Scot, the rest English. The majority were traveling in
                    family groups, but Smith appears on the list as a single individual. Among the emigrants aboard the
                        <hi rend="i">Elisha Dennison</hi>, farmers outnumbered all others although roughly half were
                    either tailors, mechanics, clerks, or miners. There was also a laborer and a doctor. Interestingly,
                    Smith is described as a farmer.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> It is possible that he so described himself
                    because of his experience on his father' fifty acres in Walton and because he no longer
                    considered himself a shoemaker at this stage in his life. Unfortunately, Smith spends surprisingly
                    little time recounting the voyage, but no doubt he experienced the combination of sickness, terror,
                    boredom, and anxiety that seem to have been practically universal for Atlantic voyages at the
                        time.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> More important to Smith were his memories of his first taste of
                    America, his trip via the Erie Canal and Great Lakes to the wild Indiana frontier, his meeting with
                    Lyman Beecher, and his emotional reunion with the brother he had not seen for fourteen years.

            <p>During his early days in America Smith had experiences that were common to many English immigrants
                    entering the Old Northwest during the antebellum era. For example, although he had not intended to
                    resume his trade in shoemaking, he was soon compelled to do so for his survival. Also, he virtually
                    had to re-learn his craft when he was forced to use wooden pegs instead of the shoe nails that were
                    more readily available in <placeName>

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> the first chance he got. However, after spending some time with his brother in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>—a "small village" at the time—and surviving

                    </placeName>, Indiana, and set up his own shoe business. His success there, his involvement in

                    $3,000 and with two children.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most dramatic event in this period of Smith' life was his return visit to Walton in
                    1853. This time he made the crossing in only fourteen days aboard the new steamship <hi rend="i">City of <placeName>

                    words, "thoroughly Americanized," while his old village had remained the same. His
                    reunion with his blind eighty-three-year-old father was very touching and well timed: within a few
                    days the father died, and Smith erected the tombstone that still stands in St. Peter'
                    churchyard.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, Smith had changed so much by 1853 that in his native village he was struck by the
                    "oddity of the Yorkshire dialect," <list type="footnotes">

                            was also observing the displacement of the Potawatomis and Miamis during the late 1830s and

                    ascribed to "several new railroads cutting off its best trade." In response Smith
                    began "to cast about for a new locality," and in the spring of 1855 he left his

                    shoemaking industry. Osgood was by 1850 the largest manufacturer in Indiana' boot and shoe
                    industry. His steam-powered last and peg factory employed fifteen men and produced $8,000
                    worth of goods during that year.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Through <placeName>

            <p>The decision to team up with Osgood was made as much by Smith' wife, Belvidere, as it was by
                    Smith himself, and it was actually <placeName>

                    form the partnership with him. Smith recounts with agony his later realization that Osgood'
                    business ability, habits, and ethics, not to mention his credit, were hardly the stuff of which
                    successful businesses were made. Smith does not hesitate to claim that it was only his own hard work
                    and ability that allowed the business to survive and grow. "For many years," he
                    claims, "I did the work of both partners." <placeName>

                    producing wheels, which clearly had a more promising future than manufacturing lasts and pegs. Smith
                    and Osgood proceeded to forge a close and productive relationship, although Smith did clearly retain

            <p>The magnitude of Smith' success, measured in terms of the size of his business and its
                    importance to Indiana' industrial history, was impressive and was in large part the result
                    of his own hard efforts and capital. The company' ideal location was also an important
                    factor. With easy access to high-grade walnut, oak, hickory, and other hardwoods, the company could
                    tap the growing wheel market that served not only the westward movement but also the growing cities
                    in the eastern states and Old Northwest.</p>
            <p>This thriving enterprise also owed much to the skilled workers who were attracted to the company by
                    its fairly generous wages. Among them the most important and famous was surely John Muir. After
                    emigrating from <placeName>

                    </placeName> with his family in 1849 at age eleven, Muir used his extraordinary mechanical skills to
                    gain a position at <placeName>

                    $18 per week, he was soon paid $25 per week after he had designed the device
                    that automatically produced the spokes, hubs, and exterior rims of the Sarven wheel. Muir then
                    brought greater efficiency to the company by redesigning the belt system and tightening the
                    factory' organization. Osgood and Smith were so impressed with Muir' many
                    abilities that they were ready to follow his advice on extending the factory and perhaps offer him a
                    partnership. However, after a serious eye injury while at work in March of 1867, Muir decided to
                    change the course of his life and leave <placeName>

                    pursue his interests as a naturalist, eventually writing his books on the natural beauty of the West
                    and founding in 1892 the Sierra Club, of which he was president until his death in 1914.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

                    recollections is the dread with which I looked upon the effigy of an old warrior, in complete armor,
                    lying in state, with his faithful dog at his feet, and being told that every night at 12
                    o'clock the dog brought his master a drink of water from a neighboring spring.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The Fairfax family lost their property on account of the part they took in the

            <p>My father was one of the tenants of the Walton estate…. Our family have lived in the same
                    house for over two centuries. My father died in the house where he was born, as did his father
                    before him, and both were very old men. My youngest brother, Thomas, lives in the same old stone
                    house, and one of his boys will no doubt follow him.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Walton is a village of
                    about 300 inhabitants. Being an agricultural village and off the routes of travel, and depending
                    entirely upon the cultivation of the land belonging to it for its support, it changes very little
                    from year to year, either in its character, size, or population…. The old stone church

                    of his life he farmed about fifty acres of land, and kept the only shop, or store, in the village.
                    He was for nearly fifty years Parish Clerk, and part of that time, with the assistance of his
                    daughter, taught the village school. For half a century he was the representative of religion in the
                    village, and in this respect occupied a rather odd position. While he was Parish Clerk, performing

                    the rent and seemed in danger of losing the home of their fathers; yet in all these gloomy days,
                    dark as they were, while mother saw nothing but the workhouse before them, father' trust
                    was unshaken, and his peace undisturbed….</p>
            <p>My first schooling was at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Molly Farrers</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where I was sent, like many other children, to keep us out of mischief…. I
                    then attended school and learnt to write, with a cripple named Weatherby, who was a tyrant and
                    abused all boys that he was not afraid of—either them or their parents…. I was
                    at this time between nine and ten years old, and had begun to be a voracious reader. My father had
                    the Spectator, and a few more old English books,—[Edward] Young' Night Thoughts, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, etc. Of these I read all that I could understand. During this time my father and
                    mother very carefully instilled into my mind religious instruction; taught me to <hi rend="i">dread
                        theft, lying, profanity, Sabbath breaking</hi>, and other sins; taught me the simple truths of
                    the gospel, penitence for sin….</p>
            <p>When I was about thirteen years of' age I had learnt to read, write. and cypher a little, my
                    parents thought it time that I should <pb n="37" id="VAA4025-091-1-043"/> learn a trade. On looking
                    around, my mother' sister, Aunt Coul-son, living near Tadcaster, a market town four miles
                    distant from our village, was the patron of a shoemaker named Thos. Lockwood, and as a great favor
                    to her he agreed to take me as an apprentice for seven years upon the condition that my father pay a
                    premium of two pounds and provide for my clothing and tools during my apprenticeship, the master
                    agreeing to provide me with <hi rend="i">aprons….</hi> The papers were all signed and I
                    was <hi rend="i">alone in the world.</hi> Soon as I could find a place I had a good cry, and felt
                    better. Then I began a new life. The boy above me, Tom Hazelwood, was from a low family, could
                    neither read nor write, and seeming to think me an aristocrat that he had to bring down, commenced a
                    course of petty persecution that made my life miserable. He was not a bad fellow, but he seemed to
                    think that I needed the hazing process…. I went home every Sunday morning and returned at
                    night. These walks across the meadows are crowded with associations and recollections. On passing
                    the valley through which the river Wharfe runs there is an eminence near Tadcaster from which our
                    village could be seen. On my solitary return in the summer evenings I used to sit down, and on
                    looking at the village church, and my father' house, tinged by the setting sun, suffer from
                    the heart yearning, home sickness, that cannot be described. The old village, and my
                    father' house, seemed the most lovely spot upon earth, and it was like tearing heart
                    strings to leave it.</p>
            <p>… During these years I was reading every thing I could get hold of. I had read all
                    father' books, and now got [Oliver] Goldsmith' works, which I read with wonderful
                    relish. When I was sixteen years old I had a good, round voice, and was invited to sing with the
                    choir in the Methodist chapel. I now began to pick up music. By working over hours I got a little
                    money and bought a blank music book, and tried to copy tunes. Printed music books were so costly
                    that few were sold. I bought a common flute and tried to learn to play. In all this Mrs. Lockwood
                    was constantly in my way, she never reading any thing herself, honestly believing that no boy could
                    properly learn his trade who had so many crotchets in his head. And this was made apparent by my
                    shopmate, Tom, who worked well at his trade, but could do nothing else. She accordingly tried to
                    make Lockwood, who had more sense but who was a good easy man, to forbid my reading books, playing
                    or writing music, etc…. One very great trouble of this part of my life was my unfortunate
                    impediment of speech. I <hi rend="i">stuttered awfully….</hi> This almost made my life a
                    burden. I would then have given any thing that I had in the world to <hi rend="i">talk like other
                        people….</hi> It is rather curious that this misfortune of my youth, that no doubt
                    changed the whole course of my life and largely affected my future destiny, should have almost
                    entirely disappeared in my old age, so that now it is almost a thing of the past….</p>
            <pb n="38" id="VAA4025-091-1-044"/>
            <p>Developing considerable talent for music, I was appointed to lead the choir in the Methodist Chapel,
                    which I continued to do for several years. It was during this time that my brothers, Benjamin and
                    John, concluded that they could improve their fortune by emigrating to America. Benjamin, after
                    learning his trade, had worked in Leeds, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and other large cities and towns. John had for some time been working for Billy
                    Walker, of Walton. This was a great affliction to my parents. Benjamin wrote long letters home,
                    giving glowing accounts of the new country. I then first had the desire to follow him. After my
                    apprenticeship expired I worked with my master as journeyman nearly a year, and went home for one
                    winter. I found out that I had <hi rend="i">outgrown the old nest</hi>, and that the old home that I
                    had thought so lovely was rather a poky place. However, I had a violincello made, and sawed on that
                    all I wanted, and did considerable shoemaking for the village. In the spring I found work at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Knarsboro</settlement>
                    </placeName>…. Here I <hi rend="i">narrowly escaped ruin.</hi> I had a cousin,
                    considerably older than myself, who was housekeeper for a rich old man. Having the charge of a large
                    house it was very pleasant to visit her, which I did very frequently. Though she had suffered very
                    much by having an illegitimate child, her amorous inclinations were strong as ever. I was twenty
                    one; she was thirty. She laid snares for me which, if I had fallen into them, would have clouded all
                    my life. She was not a bad woman, but could not control her desires….</p>
            <p>Having now an offer of a good permanent seat of work at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chapeltown</settlement>
                    </placeName> I went to live there. This is a suburb of the great town of Leeds. John Banke, the man
                    I worked for, was a Methodist local preacher. I remained there nearly three years. I established a
                    choir and built a gallery in the church, was appointed Society Steward and Secretary to the Sabbath
                    School….</p>
            <p>After living in Leeds over two years, my old friend and master, Lockwood, made me a tempting offer to
                    go back to Tadcaster and take charge of his shop. As I had then determined on coming to America, and
                    only needed the means to do so, I accepted his offer. I now occupied a different position than I had
                    ever done before, and the year I remained there was perhaps the most important year of my life. It
                    seemed to be a crisis, a <hi rend="i">pivotal point</hi> of my life, upon which the future turned.
                    And I have often thought of what the future might have been if a different <hi rend="i">direction</hi> had been given to my life. My religious experience, and life, at this time was <hi rend="i">honest</hi> and <hi rend="i">sincere.</hi> If I knew my own heart I wanted to know the
                        <hi rend="i">will of God</hi> concerning me, and I think was willing to do it. And to this end I
                    earnestly sought divine aid and direction to enable me to decide aright as to my future course. And
                    yet, on looking back over the way, I cannot help thinking that I made a <hi rend="i">mistake</hi> in
                    the <hi rend="i">course I took.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On my return to Tadcaster I took an active part in church matters…. And being among my old
                    warm friends, and near home <pb n="39" id="VAA4025-091-1-045"/> where I could often run over and see
                    my parents, and being a good deal flattered by my superiors, it may be inferred that I was
                    satisfied, <hi rend="i">but it was not so.</hi> While working in the shoe shop I felt that I was <hi rend="i">capable of something better;</hi> and yet I could see nothing better before me there.
                    If I was to marry I could see nothing but the conditions of thousands of as good shoemakers as
                    myself, supporting a wife and family in poverty, by hard work. My brothers told me of the superior
                    advantages in the new world; that nothing could prevent any man of ordinary talents and industry
                    attaining success and prosperity. My mother up to this time would never give her consent to my
                    taking this step, and I had promised her that I should never go without it, and I never intended to
                    do so. She, however, saw that I was unsettled, and seeing little prospect of any thing else, thought
                    it her duty to make the sacrifice which, hard as it was, she nobly did….</p>
            <p>During this time some things occurred that seemed to indicate future <hi rend="i">possibilities.</hi>
                    I found few of the young men of my associates to be as well read as myself. In order to promote a
                    spirit of inquiry and emulation in them and myself I got up a Theological Society for the purpose of
                    discussion and mental improvement. In order that we might have perfect freedom it was made a secret
                    society. I was elected President. It was a <hi rend="i">perfect success.</hi> Here I made a
                    discovery, both to myself and friends: I found that in these meetings I had a power of speech, an
                    ability to impress an audience, that was unknown either to me or my friends before…. the
                    Rev'd Samuel Dunn, a very noted and eloquent preacher, thought that notwithstanding the
                    impediment in my speech I had the natural talents to make an effective public speaker, and that as I
                    had given evidence of honest and sincere piety I ought to <hi rend="i">become a minister</hi> and
                    preach the gospel. Mr. Dunn called me out of the shop one day and told me that he and all my friends
                    believed that God had called and intended me <hi rend="i">for a preacher.</hi> Thinking this a
                    natural impossibility, I had never given it a thought, and had now made all my arrangements for
                    leaving the country.</p>
            <p>This was undoubtedly the <hi rend="i">turning point</hi> of my life, and though I thought myself
                    sincere and most earnestly asked God to direct me in making choice of the two paths before me; one
                    to stay where I was, try my ability as a local preacher, then if I succeeded, go to the Seminary and
                    after getting an education become a traveling preacher, with no prospect of marrying or settling in
                    life for several years,—or, taking the course that I did. After events always left the
                    impression on my mind that notwithstanding my sincerity I <hi rend="i">missed my way</hi> and made a
                        <hi rend="i">wrong</hi> choice. In after years I found myself capable of producing striking
                    effects upon almost any congregation, and of possessing powers that would have made me a popular and
                    effective speaker. But this is all past; the unknown possibilities have faded away …</p>

            <p>… After weighing every thing carefully and sincerely praying for divine direction, I
                    determined upon seeking my home in the new world. My oldest brother, Benjamin, was then settled in
                    business in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a small town in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, fourteen miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. John was living at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he continued to reside until his death in 1874. Though not making much money,
                    their prospects were very much better than mine. Thinking that on account of the impediment in my
                    speech I should never be able to make a public speaker, and consequently that there was nothing for
                    me but the shoe bench, and its stigma and social degradation, without very much prospect of anything
                    else … I concluded to emigrate. This was in the summer of 1835. I found that by September
                    I should have about a hundred pounds. This, by economy, would get me to my brother Benjamin, in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. So I arranged to bid farewell to all my friends, and the loved home of my childhood,
                    perhaps forever. I thought it best to keep my project secret until a short time before I was ready
                    to start. I was afraid of my friends and my resolutions….</p>
            <p>I now told my friends of my intention of going away, perhaps forever. I well recollect the little
                    room in which I told my old master, Lockwood. He asked me if I was in earnest; I told him that I
                    was. I can see how his lip quivered and his eyes filled with tears. The terrible ordeal now came of
                    parting forever with my parents, and my sisters and brother. It seemed to me that I loved my mother
                    and my sister Mary Ann dearer than my own soul, and I dreaded the hour of parting. They had been for
                    some time getting my things ready, and I went over home to spend a little time before I started. The
                    last moment came. We had all tried to keep up our spirits, though sadness was in our hearts. Mother,
                    father and sisters were all sitting by the fireside. I walked backward and forward across the room,
                    when, watching my opportunity I said, "I'm off and shot out of the back door and
                    almost ran down the yard towards the orchard, and the gate that opens into the road. My mother and
                    sisters gave one suppressed scream. The time occupied by that walk was the <hi rend="i">bitterest
                        moment</hi> of my life. Truly the concentration of misery. I stopped and thought that I <hi rend="i">must go back;</hi> but I walked on to the land, and then my pent up agony found relief
                    in tears, and my breaking heart found relief in a good cry…. I bid goodbye to my numerous
                    friends that night, and long before daylight next morning took the coach for Leeds, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Manchester</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and there took the railroad, the first ever built and the only one then running to
                        Liverpool.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Here I met several parties from our part of the county, going to
                    America. We soon found that we had fallen into the hands of sharks who had plundered us
                    unmercifully. But we found an American <list type="footnotes">

                    Second Cabin, and the rest, with a motley crowd, most Irish, took the Steerage. We had hardly got
                    out of the river Mercy before it begun to blow heavily, and we had a gale that drove us towards the
                    dangerous Irish coast. Our vessel, the Elisha Dennison, being a temperance ship, not a drop of
                    liquor was allowed among the stores; the consequences was, that the whole crew had been on a drunk
                    the day and night before coming on board when the storm struck us, every thing was in confusion,
                    with a large crowd of passengers that had never seen the sea before. The experience, and scenes, of
                    that night I shall never forget. I lashed myself to the upper deck with a rope, and expected never
                    to see the morning. When the storm abated we found that we were in a leaky vessel, with the wide
                    Atlantic before us. During that night of confusion and dread, with death, as I thought, just before
                    me, I was calm and my mind was at peace. With varying weather, and many incidents, one long month
                    passed over, when one morning we heard the joyful cry of "Land from the masthead. What to
                    our straining eyes seemed a cloud on the horizon soon showed itself to be <hi rend="i">terra

                    </placeName>. How freshly all these scenes come to my mind; the strange sights and the amusing
                    blunders we made when we got on shore. Everything was new and everything was strange. I spent
                    several days in <placeName>

                    house, etc. Several families that came over with us wanting to go West wished me to go with them and
                    do their business. So we all started up the North [Hudson] river for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>. We then made a contract for the whole company upon an emigrant boat on the Erie Canal.
                    We were nearly two weeks in reaching Buffalo. When passing through the numerous locks we sometimes
                    made excursions into the country to buy provisions, get fruit, etc. This was during October and
                    November; the weather was fine. On reaching Buffalo we took steamer for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> and had a very rough passage; we then took canal for Portsmouth. This though long, was
                    a very pleasant part of the journey.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Here I met my friend Childlaw, who had
                    charge of a company of Welsh emigrants. We took steamboat at <placeName>

                    anxious to go. Being an utter stranger I went out and thought that I would follow the first stream
                    of people I met, as they would probably lead me to a church. I found such a stream, and was shown
                    into the first house of worship I attended in my new home. I <list type="footnotes">

                    man without any clerical dress, or appearance bustled up the aisle and went into the pulpit without
                    any of that pulpit decorum that I had been used to. He then went through the services in a very odd
                    manner, pulling his glasses from his forehead and shoving them back many times. I soon found, with
                    all his oddities, that he was a great man, and on asking his name found it was the great Dr. Lyman
                    Beecher. On Monday morning I started out on foot for my brother Benjamin' residence, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alexandria</settlement>
                    </placeName>, about fourteen miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Not having seen my brother since I was a boy, and hearing of him only by his own
                    letters, I was a little anxious to learn what kind of a man he had developed into, and what was his
                    character in his new home. I found the country very wild, the roads bad, and though so near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, very thinly settled. While plodding through the woods I met a man on horseback. After
                    he had passed he turned around and asked me if my name was not Smith. This question in this new
                    country in this wild wood startled me. How could anyone know my name? I asked why? He said that he
                    knew my brother, who was expecting me, and then went on to say that I had a brother of which I might
                    be proud; that he was one of the best men in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Campbell County</region>
                    </placeName>, and he could be elected to any office he might select, etc. etc. This being the first
                    word I had of him, except from himself, for fourteen years, I was very much gratified. I found
                    afterwards that this was Senator De Courcy [William DeCoursey?]. While staying with my brother a few
                    days to decide upon what I should do, I found every thing new and strange. I recollect when the
                    first loaf or pone of cornbread, baked in the vessel in the hot ashes, came on the table, it looked
                    like rich sponge cake, exceedingly tempting to an hungry man, as I then was. But on taking a good
                    bit I found it more like the apples of Sodom, fair to the eye but not good to the taste. And though
                    I found all my brother' family to be fond of and eat it with great relish (indeed they
                    could get little of any thing else) yet though I have been trying nearly forty years to conquer the
                    aversion, I have not succeeded.</p>
            <p>Before leaving <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> I had built many airy castles in the air as to what I should <hi rend="i">do</hi> in
                    the new country, though I had brought my shoemaker kit with me, I never expected to use it again. I
                    had chafed many times under the <hi rend="i">stigma</hi> that attaches to the name of <hi rend="i">shoemaker</hi>, and thought that I should now forever throw it off, but I soon found that there
                    were too many men who thought as I did, and that all light employments, as clerkships, etc. were
                    crowded, as they always have been; and I had no money the only thing I could do was to go to work at
                    the hotel shoemaking and thus learn the usages of the trade and make some money. I found that they
                    sewed shoes together with <hi rend="i">wooden pegs</hi>, and many other strange things that I had
                    never seen before; so I got work in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, brought <pb n="43" id="VAA4025-091-1-049"/> out my old kit, and again mounted the shoe
                    bench. Finding that I had even my own trade to learn over, and that instead of hosts of friends and
                    a good position in society, I was now a poor shoemaker in a large city. My bubbles all melted into
                    thin air; and that most dreadful feeling, homesickness, came on me with crushing effect. It seemed
                    that I would give every thing that I had in the world if I was only back in the place that I had
                    left. And I fully determined, however humiliating it might be, to return as soon as I could earn the
                    money. I soon, however, made friends and found, as I have done before, that my musical abilities
                    were of very great benefit to me, enabling me to get into society to which my shopmates could not
                    reach. I found that my Yorkshire brogue was against me. I well recollect asking a gentleman at a
                    musical party if his tuning fork was a hay fork, meaning was it "A" or
                    "G". He, to make the bull more pointed, asked me what I said. I could not conceive
                    what they were laughing at, when I, in all simplicity, repeated the question. I soon, however, found
                    where to put the "H", and to do many other things. I stayed and worked during that
                    winter and spring in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and then … made arrangements with my cousin, Benjamin Smith, to go and
                    visit Brother John, who had then a contract on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> Canal. I accordingly worked at my trade in Rising Sun that summer. Having each a good
                    horse we started for the wilds of Indiana. This was an entirely new life to me. We went through <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to St. Mary' (they were just then making that canal). Then we struck the woods
                    and crossed the Black Swamp.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> We put up usually at the last cabin we came to
                    just before dark, and with one exception always found hospitality, plenty cornbread, bacon, and
                    whiskey. But the woods, when there was any, to my English eyes, were what before I had no conception
                    of. After various adventures we reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, then a small village. Here we found my brother, not in as good a condition as
                    Benjamin, but a good man. This was in the height of the land fever. The Pottowatomie tribe of
                    Indians had just sold their land to the Government and were about to be moved to their reservation
                    in the West.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> This brought a greedy horde of land speculators to the Land Office

                    compass with us, started out to find it. We passed a fine company of Indian braves of the Miami

                    for the first time, I heard the "wolfs long howl." In crossing <geogName>Eel

                    he struck the limb of a tree and knocked himself and horse backwards down the bank into the river. I
                    got him out of the water and on his horse again, and finding a house a few miles off in the woods,
                    we asked their hospitality. We stayed with that excellent family for two weeks before he was able to
                    travel. This family was from <placeName>

                    of father, mother, two grown daughters, two grown sons, one with his wife and some younger children,
                    and yet they made room for two strangers. Seeing the beds close together I wondered how the men and
                    women were ever going to get to bed. When it came bed time I saw the ladies for some cause
                    disappear. When in a few minutes the men were all in bed and the lights put out, and no doubt the
                    women followed. Being very tired I slept sound and awaked next morning to find the women cooking
                    breakfast close by on the stove. I could not see how one could possibly get up with that crowd of
                    women in the room. Whispering this to my cousin, he at once got up and dressed. He had been living
                    in such a house for many years. Not having his experience I anxiously looked for my clothes and had
                    considerable difficulty in finding the way into my pants. I soon, however, settled into their habits
                    and found them most excellent people. We found the land, but it was not what my cousin wanted. We
                    returned to the <geogName>Wabash River</geogName>; stayed at Segro [Lagro?]<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    taken with bilious fever, and was laid on my back several weeks. I had never been sick before. I
                    found it a hard experience. In my delirium I would suppose that I was at home surrounded by my
                    friends and wake to find myself alone, a <hi rend="i">stranger</hi> in a strange land. After several

                    expenses. Here again I found the advantage of my musical abilities of benefit. I soon got into good
                    society and made many friends. Here I found an opening for business, and believing that I could get
                    a little money from my friends I made arrangements to buy out a shop, which I was to take in the
                    spring. In order to carry out this arrangement, I started for <placeName>

                    </placeName>. This took me a week to accomplish. I then for the first and last time saw a prairie on

                    forests I was one night belated and came upon a cabin in a lonely spot. It was my only chance, and I
                    asked for lodging. The man told me to come in. Murdering travelers for their money was then a common
                    occurrence, and I was afraid that I had fallen in just such a trap. We sat down to a plain supper,
                    but when the man said it was their custom to ask a blessing before eating, it was like a sudden
                    blaze of sunshine flooding the rough cabin and its rough inmates with light, and dispersing all my
                    fears in a moment. Dishonest men never ask a blessing. I got into <placeName>

                    I got work and intended to remain until time to return in the spring. That winter was a critical
                    turn of my life. My health was poor; my religious associations all broken up; my business plans
                    disappointed—all produced great mental depression. I was then strongly tempted to use <hi rend="i">brandy as an antidote</hi>, as many a poor fellow has done before. But I saw the gulf,

                    my own in some small town. Having scraped together about $700.00 I heard of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana as a thriving town. I accordingly took the mail boat and went down to see it.
                    I found it about the size and general appearance that I wanted,<hi rend="sup">12</hi> and thinking
                    that I saw an opening for my business I rented a small room. I then laid in a stock of tools and
                    materials and taking three of my shopmates, good workmen, with me, started for my new home. I found
                    very keen competition from men of heavy capital. But here again my voice, and the ability to use it,
                    were of great service to me. One of the leading men of Wesley Chapel had heard of me in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and wanted me to get them up a choir…. In order to do this they wanted me
                    to teach a singing school to the whole church. I had never done any thing of this kind; but the
                    flattering offer of $150.00 decided me to make the attempt. This I did, with much
                    trembling, but succeeded far better than I expected. The Second Presbyterian Church now offered me a
                    salary to lead their choir, but as the Wesley Chapel friends had first taken me up I would not leave
                    them. The Second Presbyterian Church holding their services morning and afternoon, they proposed to
                    pay me for rehearsing with their choir during the week, and singing with them on Sunday afternoons.
                    Thus for some time I led the choirs of two churches at the same time. These connections I found very
                    beneficial to my business, which I followed as closely and economically as possible….
                    After a while I took a large room and increased my stock. Though during this time, through my choir
                    and singing school, I mingled a good deal with female society, and was getting into circumstances
                    that I could support a wife, I did not meet with any person that possessed what I thought the
                    necessary qualifications for making a good wife; so I appeared to settle into a confirmed old
                    bachelor. I worked hard and paid close attention to my business. During this time I paid close
                    attention to music. I was leader in two church choirs, president of a musical society composed of
                    all the best singers in the city, and at the same time helped to get up and form a brass band, and
                    was elected Captain of it, which position I held as long as it remained in existence. Instead of
                    letting these musical engagements interfere and injure my business, I made them contribute to its
                    prosperity. This it did by giving me publicity and making me friends. So though I had not much
                    capital, and had to meet keen competition, yet by close attention to my business, and a willingness
                    to oblige, I made many friends and prospered.</p>

                    old home, and my father, who was then in his 83rd year, determined me to make the attempt. My
                    excellent little wife, seeing me restless and anxious to make the trip, urged me to do it; so
                    putting my business in order (I then had an excellent and trusty foreman, S. O. Charlesworth) in
                    company with my friend Arthur Orr, who wanted to return to <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>, I started for home. Having to buy some goods in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> I stopped one day as I went East. I remember when lying in bed that night at the hotel,
                    and looking at the home I had left, and at the journey before me, my courage almost forsook me, and
                    my heart so yearned for my own fireside and the loved ones around it, that if it had not been for
                    the fear of being laughed at, I would have been tempted to have turned back. But I hurried on to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, there met my friend Orr, we engaged passage on the iron steamship "City of
                    Glascoe," and after a pleasant passage of twelve days landed in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. Some particulars of this ship may be named: She was owned in <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>; her officers were Scotchmen; her captain, Wylie, was so popular with the passengers
                    that a valuable piece of silver plate, with a vote of thanks, was presented to him. I was appointed,
                    with another gentleman, to purchase and present it to him. After we landed in Liverpool another
                    striking fact was that this ship, as fine a sea boat as ever rode the top of a wave, was lost with
                    every soul on board, a few months after she had taken us so safely and pleasantly across. Not a
                    vestige or spar was ever seen of her after she left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, nor a soul left to tell the tale of her destruction. I was providentially saved from
                    the calamity.</p>
            <p>It was now eighteen years since I had left the fast anchored Isle, at the time of life when the mind
                    is usually formed, moulded, and hardened for life. My experience had been a varied one, I had <pb n="48" id="VAA4025-091-1-054"/> begun at the bottom. My illusory dreams and bright visions of
                    this land of promise having all vanished, and through disappointment, poverty and sickness, by
                    steady perseverance, had worked my way upward so that now I had a good house and home of my own, a
                    dear good wife and four children; had a prosperous business, was a citizen of no mean city, had
                    voted for several Presidents of the Republic. I had thus become thoroughly Americanized in taste,
                    thought and feeling, so that when I landed in Liverpool every thing seemed almost as strange as they
                    did when I landed in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> …. I had just this mingling of feeling,-strangeness and familiarity. Landing
                    on Sunday morning I heard the first sweet chimes of bells that I had heard since leaving that port
                    eighteen years ago. How sweetly they sounded in my ears; what blessed recollections they brought to
                    my mind. They seemed to welcome me home; and yet, how strange seemed the narrow streets, and the
                    heavy, unsightly buildings; how heavy and clumsy were all the vehicles from the dray to the carnage;
                    how slow and steady the pace of the fat, elephantine horses; how different the Yankee quickness,
                    lightness, elegance and snap that I had been so long used to and that I so much <hi rend="i">admired….</hi> After much delighting our little Scotch Captain with our gift of
                    silver plate I turned my steps toward home.</p>
            <p>I now soon found that in this old, steady, slow country, Time had made some rapid and wonderful
                    changes while I had been away. I had come to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Manchester</settlement>
                    </placeName> by the old, slow stage coach, a tedious, cold and wet ride. It seemed natural for me to
                    look for the same experience; and yet I had hardly got comfortably settled in the railway carriage
                    before first one town and then another that used to be a great distance apart, were called. It
                    seemed hard to realize that the hitherto insurmountable <hi rend="i">distance</hi> that had kept
                    these large and busy centers apart from each other had been annihilated, and that the genius and
                    pluck of the collier, George Stephenson, had wrought this miracle.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> While
                    flying over the country in this amazed state of mind Tadcaster was called. Could this be the place
                    where I had lived ten years? Where I had suffered so many heartaches, and where as a boy had shed so
                    many tears …? Where the grand possibilities of public life first dawned upon me like a
                    rift in the clouds, opening a bright perspective in the distant future and then closing forever.
                    Rapidly as thoughts flash through the mind, I had hardly a moment to think before <hi rend="i">Walton</hi> was called, and I was landed at the station about half a mile from the village. I
                    walked down the lane, every turn and gate of which I knew. I was fortunately alone. I went into the
                    wicket orchard gate, through which I had passed with a bursting, aching heart eighteen years before.
                    How the concentrated, inexpressible bitterness of the moment came over my mind. I lingered in the
                    orchard, noted the <list type="footnotes">

                    apple and plum; I could not tell their names, but could point to the exact spot where they
                    grew…. How strange, though now so near my father, brother and sister, and longing to
                    grasp their hands and hold them to my heart, I yet dreaded the meeting. My brother' wife,
                    whom I had never seen, observing a stranger in the orchard, came down to see who it was, and finding
                    a rather outlandish looking fellow concluded that it must be her American brother-in-law. I found my
                    father, whom I had left a hale, hearty man, now infirm and entirely blind. Like the old patriarch
                    Jacob when Joseph was found, "he wept a long while" at the return of his son. He
                    had almost given up the hope of ever meeting me again in this world. My dear sister and myself could
                    only express our joy by having a good hearty cry in each other' arms. I found the village
                    very little changed. Only one new house had been built. For some time I seemed a "boy
                    again," and fairly reveled in enjoyment. I strolled through the green lanes where I had
                    tended the cows; I laid down upon the rich carpet of green grass and flowers and listened to the
                    skylark singing out of sight up in the clear blue sky. I went to the banks under the hedges where I
                    knew the violets and primroses used to grow in my father' fields, and there I found them
                    fresh and blooming, and fragrant as they were when I was a boy. I went to a place where I knew a
                    blackbird used to build her nest and found that the descendants of the birds that I had known had
                    not like me left the old favored locality. While rambling alone over the scenes of my boyhood and
                    youth, the time that I had been away seemed like a dream of the night. I could hardly realize that I
                    had a large business, a home, wife, family and friends in a foreign land. The villagers and my own
                    folds [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] could not understand all this, and no doubt thought that I had become
                    a curious genius. After the excitement of my return had passed my father seemed, like old Semion
                        [Simeon?]<hi rend="sup">14</hi> to say - "Now let thy servant depart in
                    peace." And in a few weeks I closed his eyes and saw him laid in the old church yard by the
                    side of my dear mother, and the bones of his forefathers, to sleep until the morning of the
                    resurrection. I erected a monument to their memory, and was truly thankful that I had fulfilled my
                    promise and yielded to the impression so strongly made upon my mind to visit my father before he
                    died. My father died, as he had lived, at peace with God and all mankind….</p>
            <p>Though familiar to my boyhood and youth many things now appeared odd and strange. The variations and
                    oddity of the Yorkshire dialect, each town and village almost having its peculiarity. Then the
                    strange length of the days. I could read by daylight at near ten o'clock at night. While in
                    Leeds I had a little shopping to <list type="footnotes">

                    found all the stores or shops closed. My first thought was that it must be some national holiday,
                    but I found that business had closed for the day, it being past eight o'clock….</p>
            <p>After visiting my numerous relatives I went up to <placeName>

                    </placeName> and spent several weeks very pleasantly. I had seen Queen Victoria when a young
                    unmarried lady. The week before I started for America, she, with her mother, was attending the great
                    Musical Festival held in York Minster. Grisi, Braham, and all the great celebrities in music were
                        there.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> The first night I arrived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> I went to the Opera at Drury Lane Theatre. The Queen was there and Grisi sang. I saw
                    the Queen several times afterwards, more especially upon a rather remarkable occasion at Windsor
                    Park. This was just before the great Crimean war, which was then threatening to break out every day.
                    Great preparations were being made by the Government and Nation to meet the shock. The Army and Navy
                    were being put upon a war footing; large bodies of troops were encamped and constantly drilled in
                    the Commons in the neighborhood of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Sham battles were sometimes had, but the occurrences of these were carefully kept from
                    the public, as too large crowds gathered to witness them…. The Queen was then a healthy,
                    matronly looking woman, not very tall nor yet, as some have said, <hi rend="i">dumpy.</hi> She
                    looked the good wife and mother that she proved to be. She was plainly dressed and had nothing to
                    distinguish her from any sensible lady in the crowd. She made a very <hi rend="i">favorable</hi>
                    impression on my mind….</p>
            <p>After visiting several other places of note in different parts of the Kingdom my thoughts began to
                    fly to what was now my home, and my face was once more turned to the Setting Sun….</p>
            <p>I now bid my early home another farewell; but how different was this to the first one! I now had a
                    loved home of my own in the far off West, and I knew that the loved ones there had long missed me
                    and were anxiously waiting for my return, so that instead of the dreadful heartsickness I had before
                    felt when passing out of the orchard gate my heart, though sad at the thought of parting with my
                    brother and sister probably for the last time upon earth, yet leaped with joy in the anticipation of
                    soon having my loved ones in my arms. Arriving in Liverpool I engaged a passage in the Cunard ship

                    property and materially injured my future prospects. I had adopted the western plan in securing the
                    possession of considerable real estate, hoping that the town would continue to grow. Property began
                    to depreciate and trade to fall off. I began to cast about for a new locality. Some time before this
                    my brother-in-law Curtis had been called to the pastorate of the First Presbyterian Church of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This was then the largest church in the city. As our families were closely connected,
                    he was very anxious for me to move there. Finding a favorable business opening, he pressed me to
                    take it. I went up there in company with my wife. I found every thing excited and inflated. The
                    opening was a promising one; but it was make or break. This was just before the war. The business
                    was selling leather, which was then higher than it had been for many years. I considered buying a
                    heavy stock at inflated prices a dangerous experiment, and so declined the partnership, and so
                    missed the fortune the man made that took my place….</p>
            <p>Soon after this I had a partnership offer from J. R. Osgood of <placeName>

                    a very earnest Christian man and a member of the Baptist church, he was a most excellent salesman
                    and was considered a very wide-awake, energetic business man. In connection with C. L. Crawford he
                    had started a factory for making lasts, pegs, etc. Crawford' uncle having died he was
                    obliged to take his place in <placeName>

                    make it very profitable. Osgood professed to have made $20,000.00, and offered me a half
                    interest for $10,000.00.I objected on account of my <hi rend="i">ignorance</hi> of the
                    business; not knowing the real value of what I was buying, etc. There was the great mistake that I
                    made in this transaction. This danger I clearly saw and felt at the time, but thinking Mr.
                    Osgood' character <hi rend="i">above suspicion</hi>, I had full confidence in his
                    truthfulness and <hi rend="i">honesty.</hi> He assured me that Bugby' experience and
                    capacity in the new business was <hi rend="i">beyond doubt</hi>, and that he owned a very valuable
                    patent right for morticing hubs. On account of Mr. Osgood' <hi rend="i">religious
                    character</hi>, as an active Christian man, more than for any thing else, my wife was anxious for me
                    to accept the offer. She hoped that I should be greatly benefited by his experience and influence,
                    and in this I most heartily joined her…. I accordingly sold my business in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Charlesworth, my foreman, and J. C. Smith, and made arrangements for moving to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This was in the spring of 1855. But houses being very scarce I was not able to move my
                    family until December. I parted with the home I had built and the many warm friends I had made in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with very great regret, on March 1, 1855.I now commenced a new era in my life with an
                    entire change in my circumstances and mode of life. I had before been doing business <hi rend="i">alone</hi> and in my <hi rend="i">own</hi> way, had been the architect of my own fortunes, but
                    now I found that I had to begin afresh, to learn a <hi rend="i">new</hi> business,—not a
                    very pleasant thing at my age of life. I had not been very long in the factory before I found that
                    "all is not gold that glitters," and that my ignorance and <hi rend="i">credulity</hi> had been <hi rend="i">imposed upon.</hi> The unpleasant truth began to be only too
                    clear that my partner had not given me a full and true statement of his affairs; that instead of
                    being as prosperous as I had been led to believe, they were in a very confused, involved, and in an
                    unsatisfactory condition; that he was <hi rend="i">fearfully in debt;</hi> that his credit was very
                    much impaired, and that his modes of doing business were loose and careless, all very different to
                    the way in which I had been used to do business. Then I found that the inventory he had made of the
                    property, machinery, and stock was in many cases a great <hi rend="i">over estimate</hi> of their
                    value, some things put in at considerable price that were of no <hi rend="i">value at all.</hi>
                    These very unpleasant discoveries showed me the mistakes I had made in giving up my experience and
                    judgment and putting implicit faith and confidence in <hi rend="i">another man.</hi> This was not a
                    happy time. I very reluctantly told my friend Osgood that I had been deceived, and was disappointed,
                    and as my family had not moved <hi rend="i">I wanted to withdraw.</hi> I had then only put in a few
                    thousand dollars. I had likewise received an offer from Joseph Hendricks to go into the wholesale
                    boot and shoe business in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Mr. Osgood was very much distressed by this proposition; told me, with tears in his
                    eyes, that this would utterly <hi rend="i">ruin him</hi>, and begged me to remain with him, offering
                    at the same <pb n="53" id="VAA4025-091-1-059"/> time to correct all overcharges in the inventory.
                    Knowing that this would perhaps seriously injure and perhaps ruin him, I consented to
                    remain…. I believed him to be sincere in his religion and yet he was in the habit of
                    doing things from which my sense of honor and right <hi rend="i">recoiled.</hi> He thought it right
                    to cover up and put imperfect and damaged articles in a bill of goods, giving as a reason that no
                    goods were expected to be <hi rend="i">perfect….</hi> I found too, a most unfortunate
                    disposition of selfishness in our business matters. For many years I did the work of both partners.
                    After a little time I made myself acquainted with the mechanical portion of the business and took
                    the entire care and responsibility, which heavy burden I carried for many years…. I hope,
                    however, though I got very little good from him, he perhaps received some from me. His ideas were
                    considerably modified upon these subjects before he died….</p>
            <p>The first twelve years of my life at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> were years of disappointment, trouble and sorrow. Knowing that the last making business
                    was not capable of much more extension and that the carriage material business was, I determined to
                    push <hi rend="i">that</hi> as much as possible. But after expending a great deal of money in
                    getting up machinery, buying material, and getting the business under way, I found that I had been
                    again <hi rend="i">deceived;</hi> that Bugby, the man that had been so highly endorsed and
                    recommended by my partner, <hi rend="i">was a deception and a fraud.</hi> He had never been a
                    carriage maker and knew no more of the business than I did. He was as ignorant as a dolt and yet
                    would not acknowledge it. He had spent several thousand dollars of my hard earned money in
                    blundering experiments before I found out. I was unwilling to disbelieve the character <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Osgood</settlement>
                    </placeName> had given him and was very nearly ruined by his blundering stupidity. I knew how
                    important it was, when starting a new business, <hi rend="i">to begin aright</hi>, or disaster and
                    ruin would be the result. I found the goods we had made were not <hi rend="i">adapted to the
                    market</hi> and were of a very inferior quality, and my <hi rend="i">bright partner did not know
                        it….</hi> During this time I traversed the country all around in search of timber and
                    material, and then canvassed almost every town in the Western states to introduce and sell the
                    manufactured articles. This being then a new business it was not always an easy task. In many of the
                    principal towns in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> I was the first to introduce the trade, though since that time an immense business has
                    been done in this class of goods. By this constant perserverance [sic], and continued efforts to
                    overcome the difficulties, we kept our business going and gradually extending and
                    growing…. At that time [1864] a great misfortune befell us. Our factory, with all the
                    machinery, was burnt down to the ground. The earnings of several years was lost in a night. My good
                    natured partner, who always attended to our insurance, had most unfortunately let a large portion of
                    it expire the week before the fire. Our friends, however, rallied around us and furnished what money
                    we needed….</p>
            <pb n="54" id="VAA4025-091-1-060"/>
            <p>My health for several years was very poor. I suffered very much from dyspepsia. Then I had some very
                    severe attacks of bilious colic, cramps of the stomach, and other troubles. This was during the war,
                    and was truly a gloomy time; the future was dark and uncertain. A greater trouble, however, now
                    began to throw its shadow over me. The health of my dear wife began to fail and gradually give
                    way….</p>
            <p>In the year [1865] another important change took place in our business. Woodburn and Scott had for
                    some time been our Western competitors in the carriage material business. They had a large factory
                    and were doing an extensive business in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. I had known Woodburn as a young machinist coming out to the West without money,
                    locating in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and by industry and perserverance building up a large and profitable
                    business…. We were filling a large contract which they had given to us, for Government
                    spokes, when their factory burnt down to the ground with all the machinery and stock. About a year
                    before this, in connection with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Haven</settlement>
                    </placeName> Wheel Co., they had taken an exclusive license for making the since celebrated
                    "Sarven Wheel," then unknown. They had then, however, made enough to prove its
                    superiority over all other wheels, and succeeded in convincing all the carriage makers in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and some other places, of that fact. During the war two or three steamboats, which
                    they owned, were pressed into Government service on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> below Vicksburg. While attending to these matters just at the close of the war both the
                    partners thought they saw a great chance for speculation in buying up some Southern plantations and
                    showing the Southerners how to grow cotton. Just at this time I happened to be in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. I ought to state that not having capital enough to rebuild a factory the size they
                    wished, they had tried to get up a joint stock company, but had failed. While settling our account
                    with them they made me a proposition to sell out their business, patent rights, stock and machinery,
                    and sign a contract that they would not engage in the same business in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> for five years. I knew that there was money in the thing. But it was a greater and
                    larger enterprise than I had yet undertaken. Nelson and Kayner [Hayner?]<hi rend="sup">17</hi> of
                    Alton, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, however, told me that they would join me in any favorable business enterprise. I
                    accordingly brought the matter before them and they thought so favorably of it that we arranged to
                    form a partnership, they joining us as third partners. We accordingly paid Woodburn and Scott
                    $40,000.00, which bought their entire interest. In all this matter my partner, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Osgood</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was a mere cypher, though he had the same interest as myself….</p>

                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>; then we had a controlling interest in a factory at Metropolis upon the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Then we had two mills getting out timber. In these various factories and mills we
                    worked near six hundred men. I found this a very hard life, more especially as my dear wife was now
                    a constant care and source of anxiety. On looking back to those days I often wonder how I passed
                    through them. My wife' disease being confirmed asthma she suffered dreadfully during the
                    night. For some time before her death she was not able to sleep in bed. When the paroxysms would
                    come on, which they often do several times during the night, I would get up and fumigate the room
                    with saltpetre, and other things, to give her relief. During the two or three years before her death
                    I had, when with her, been up more or less every night.</p>

                    Smiths for years as a virtual family member. Smith was much older than Lizzie and acknowledges the
                    "delicacy" of the new relationship. As husband and wife they had one child. The
                    narrative resumes with the conclusion of Smith' story.]</p>
            <p>In the year [1871] my partner, Osgood, died. His death was sudden and unexpected both by himself and
                    his friends. This event made quite a change in the character of our business at the factory.
                    Although for many years Mr. Osgood had taken very little part in the active work and business of the
                    firm, he at the same time enabled me to hold my other impulsive, erratic partner in check. On this
                    account his loss was a serious misfortune. I now found it very difficult to do business with
                    Woodburn, either with comfort or self-respect. His egotism made him envious and jealous and thus
                    destroyed that oneness and unity of action and purpose that is so essential to success in
                    business…. And our business suffered in consequence of it. It was now very much extended.
                    We had added a store in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> to our liabilities. Our expenses were enormous. We were in debt $225,000.00
                    and Woodburn insisted upon borrowing $25,000.00 more….</p>
            <p>In the early part of 1873 our factory was again partially burned down. This was a very serious
                    misfortune…. Our insurance would cover the greater part of our loss, and the money we
                    obtained from it paid off some of our most pressing debts. But I saw very little chance of doing any
                    better with my intractable partner, and determined if possible to sell out my interest. I saw that
                    an arrangement could be made by my sacrificing from $10,000.00 to $20,000.00,
                    by which Julius Pratt, and of course my daughter, would be benefited to perhaps a larger amount than
                    that. And that arrangement could <pb n="56" id="VAA4025-091-1-062"/> be made so as to prevent
                    Woodburn from injuring the business. And so sacrificing a large amount of money which I had worked
                    hard for many years, I sold out my entire interest for $58,000.00, which will by care and
                    economy be just a competence for me in my old age. I have now a good comfortable home and settled
                    down for life a great deal better than I expected that I should ever be able to do….</p>

            <p>Smith ends his autobiography with reflections on various religious topics and references to his
                    declining health. By 1875 he was suffering from dyspepsia and severe indigestion and probably from
                    his doctor' recommended treatment—a "pounding" of his stomach
                    and bowels every morning. But after a bout with rheumatism and an operation on his urethra, he was
                    able to make another visit to Europe with the intention of improving his health and seeing Walton
                    one last time. He also made a trip to <placeName>

            <p>In today' political, social, and economic arena remembering segregation in negative terms
                    seems both logical and natural. However, the necessity of finding a way to survive within a limiting
                    system driven by segregationist tendencies has been the base from which many great African-American
                    traditions and organizations have begun. One such organization was a branch of the Young
                    Men' Christian Association. In 1900 the formation of a Young Men' Prayer Band
                    presaged the birth of the Negro YMCA in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and led to the inception of an incredible social, civic, and educational institution.</p>
            <p>In 1905, shortly after the state YMCA officially recognized the Prayer Band, members initiated a
                    series of public forums, headlined for the first ten years by local religious, business, and
                    political figures. The forums, commonly known as Monster Meetings, eventually showcased almost every
                    black leader in the country and provided a means for bringing national issues to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> area. Rebuffed by his superiors when he requested permission to call the forums
                    "The Big Meeting"—that name, it seems, was being used by the statewide
                    YMCA organization for its own meetings—Executive Secretary Thomas E. Taylor, playing the
                    game of one-upsmanship, suggested "monster" as an alternative to

            <p>Faburn E. DeFrantz, more than anyone else, has been credited for the extraordinary political and
                    social awareness and the phenomenal growth of the Negro YMCA in the Hoosier capital. He came to <placeName>

                    appointed the first black executive secretary. From 1916 until his retirement in 1952, membership in
                    the Senate Avenue branch grew from 350 to 5,270. DeFrantz believed that members of the black YMCA
                    must "go forth into battle against the evil forces which were impeding the progress of the
                    Kingdom of God and the Brotherhood of Man." It was this challenge that provided the impetus
                    for the growth of the Monster Meeting concept into the largest and most prestigious public forum in

            <p>Shortly after the beginning of the DeFrantz era of leadership, the Monster Meetings took on a
                    national flavor with more than a hint of radicalism. In the words of the executive secretary:
                    "They say that DeFrantz is too aggressive, but as long as I stay in this town I shall see
                    to it that the Negro is in the picture of what is going on."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
                    Representatives of local and state organizations continued to receive invitations to speak, but
                    nationally known figures at the Monster Meeting rostrum became commonplace. As the popularity and
                    importance of these mass education meetings grew, both the public and YMCA members exhibited a
                    higher level of community activism. The meetings were used to showcase young men of talent, to
                    provide financial support to promising youth, to further political education, to pay tribute to the
                    achievements of great men from around the country, and to provide a platform for discussions about
                    national, state, and local issues. The roll call of speakers is an indication of the significance of
                    the programs.</p>
            <p>In general, both the Monster Meeting speakers and the audiences were black, but there were many
                    exceptions. At various times mayors, governors, and legislators, all of whom were white, shared
                    their views with and answered the questions of the Monster Meeting participants. Occasionally,
                    speakers requested that their meetings be opened to women and, sometimes, to children.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> In a few instances women were invited to be Monster Meeting speakers. Marjorie Penny,

                            YMCA, the Monster Meetings were, technically, exclusively for men. According to all
                            indications, however, women were involved in the meetings from the beginning, either as
                            members of the audiences or as participants in the celebrations surrounding the events.

            <p>The season for the Monster Meeting series ran from November to March. When the public forums began in
                    1905, organizers attempted to have several speakers each month. Weekly Sunday forums during some
                    months caused great concern about financial matters as well as about the quality of the meetings. In
                    April, 1953, the Monster Meeting Planning Committee decided to reduce the number of sessions during
                    the 1953-1954 season to ten or twelve with emphasis on significant, well-known individuals. At that
                    time there was a $273 deficit in the Monster Meeting budget.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>An analysis of the origins and development of the Monster Meetings provides significant information
                    concerning the Senate Avenue YMCA itself. An extremely family-oriented organization, the YMCA
                    instituted a Monster Meeting for children in 1927. Professional and business leaders spoke to the
                    Sunday afternoon sessions, which followed much the same format as the adult forums. The success of
                    the Negro YMCA under DeFrantz' leadership also spawned a movement to create a YWCA based on
                    many of the same tenets as the men' organization. Strong support came from YMCA members. In
                    1927 Mr. and Mrs. Robert L. Brokenburr donated $1,000 to the YWCA building fund drive and
                    Mr. and Mrs. Freeman B. Ransom donated $1,100. When asked why he and his wife had been so
                    generous, Ransom answered: "My wife and I gave $1,100.00 to the YWCA building
                    fund because we felt the Association' appeal was a direct challenge to our Christianity,
                    and a test as to our interest in the women and girls of the YWCA. We felt that we could not afford
                    to give more, and we were dead sure we could not afford to give less."<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>Long an advocate of racial integration, DeFrantz also created an annual Emblem Club Racial Amity

                    for Negroes during the year. Recipients of the awards from 1947 until DeFrantz' retirement

            <p>A close examination of the list of Monster Meeting speakers and their backgrounds provides further
                    reasons to reappraise the dynamics of the Negro YMCA prior to the 1970s. Perusing such a list out of
                    context, one would never guess that in all of Indiana and the Midwest during the relevant decades,
                    racial exclusion rather than inclusion was the order of the day. The many appearances of Howard E.
                    Jensen, professor at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, as speaker at the Sunday afternoon forums underline the apparent
                    inconsistencies in segregationist policies. Although several Senate Avenue "Y"
                    boys attended <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it was common knowledge that, unlike today, the number of black students allowed on
                    campus at any one time was limited. Ironically, Jensen' favorite topic, social equality,
                    often included discussions about the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Even the segregation of public facilities in Indianapolis was inconsistently applied. The Monster
                    Meetings often brought such important speakers to the city that the limited seating capacity at the
                    Senate Avenue YMCA was insufficient. In 1953 Eleanor Roosevelt spoke, without incident, to an
                    unsegregated audience at the Murat Temple rather than at the YMCA.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> In 1958

                            Order Nobles of the Mystic Shrine. Later, the building became part of the Shubert Theatre
                            chain. Today it exists primarily as a rental hall in which as many as two hundred events are
                            held yearly.</item>

                    relegated black citizens to a relatively small world in which lawyers and truck drivers had a great
                    deal in common and often found themselves in each other' company. In the words of Dr.
                    Mordecai Johnson, long-time president of Howard University: "The redcap and the lawyer, the
                    laborer and the doctor, seek together to find answers to social and political questions …
                    herein is the very genius of Christianity."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> A classic example of the
                    full measure of this concept was found in the bylaws of the El Amigo Club, a social club with a
                    traditional sense of civic pride. A requirement for membership in the El Amigos carried a
                    stipulation that new members would also join the YMCA. As part of their community responsibility, El
                    Amigo members acted as ushers at Monster Meeting.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cooperation extended to other organizations as well. The Intercollegiate Club, composed of local
                    college students, had fully integrated branches around the city. In September, 1927, the Senate
                    Avenue YMCA sponsored a dinner and smoker for all male teachers in the city schools, and by 1931 all
                    men on the staff of Crispus Attucks High School were members of the YMCA." Consequently,
                    the school facilities were often used to support the activities of the YMCA, the Intercollegiate
                    Club, the YWCA, and the Monday Luncheon Club. Over the years the faculty of Crispus Attucks and the
                    YMCA presented a united front in attempts to persuade the central school administration to improve
                    both academic and athletic facilities at the school.</p>
            <p>It was, no doubt, this quality of experience for those involved that helped to balance life in
                    segregated <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, particularly during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. It is not unusual to hear black
                    senior citizens speak fondly of that time in their lives in spite of the pressure from local civic
                    organizations, city officials, and state legislators to create racially separate institutions in
                    Indiana. It was, for those who embraced the Monster Meeting concept, a time of foundation building
                    for the changes that were to take place in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Johnson captured the spirit
                    of the DeFrantz era when he stated: "we must work as hard for integration as if it could
                    come tomorrow; yet, at the same time, be as efficient in our segregated positions as if they were to
                    be maintained forever …."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

                    ballroom' Indiana Avenue location. The compact nature of the black residential areas in the
                    Hoosier capital, imposed in part by the racism and segregationist tendencies of the day, helped
                    sustain activities at the Negro YMCA and other Negro institutions. Within this ten-mile radius there
                    were Negro churches, theaters, and restaurants as well as Crispus Attucks High School, the Phyllis
                    Wheatley YWCA, and the Senate Avenue YMCA. With the onset of integration in housing and employment,
                    blacks began pushing north and east out of the area centered around Indiana Avenue. Perhaps there is
                    no direct correlation between changes in residential and commercial patterns in the Negro community
                    and the loss of support for programs at the Senate Avenue YMCA and its successor, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fall Creek</settlement>
                    </placeName> YMCA. The evidence strongly suggests, however, that integration, though a sign of
                    progress, contributed significantly to the end of support for the Monster Meetings.</p>
            <p>The Monster Meeting concept, with a local, religious slant, began shortly after the Prayer Band
                    became a full-fledged branch of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> YMCA in 1905. However, the crystallization of the meetings into a public forum for
                    local issues with a national connection seemed to coincide with the tradition of having Johnson as
                    the series-opening speaker each November. With one exception the Howard University president
                    performed this function every year for more than forty years. The following schedule of Monster
                    Meeting programs, though incomplete, provides significant information concerning the dynamics of the <placeName>

                    Born May 24, 1844, he was a twin whose brother died at fourteen months of age. He had seven other

                    it is, the Union as it was"—before the war. A federal government that interfered
                    with states' rights was suspect, he thought, and deserved criticism. Initially, his letters
                    do not reflect his objections to the administration' policies, probably as a result of his
                    zeal as a young recruit. As the war drags on, however, Clark becomes increasingly critical of the
                    Republicans, although ever aware of Union Army censors and possible reprimand from his officers. He
                    was not a Copperhead, but he did feel that states had the right to govern themselves without federal
                        participation.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>As did many Indiana residents, Clark feared freedom for slaves, believing the abolition of slavery
                    was also abolition of white men' rights. He reasoned that the freed blacks would come
                    north, create competition with white farmers, and destroy the prosperity that white northern America
                    had toiled for with backbreaking heroism.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Remembering his father' role

                    that the South was not completely wrong. He objected to the secession of the southern states, but he
                    also objected to the abolitionists' antislavery policies. As a young recruit, he could
                    accept war as the only answer. Later, with the deaths of local <placeName>

                            necessary. By the end of July, steps had been taken in every township in Indiana to enroll
                            men subject to conscription. An additional call for troops came on August 4, 1862. Although
                            it was subsequently proven that Indiana had supplied more than its requisite quota of
                            volunteers, records indicated that the state was in arrears. In addition, certain townships
                            within the state had not supplied their fair share of troops. For these reasons a draft was
                            held on October 6, 1862. According to the state adjutant general' report, a total

                    of the war, and firsthand knowledge of the destruction wrought by both northern and southern armies,
                    he changed his mind, deciding that compromise perhaps provided the best way for the North and South
                    to coexist. Realistically, however, he recognized as premature the rumors of compromise that
                    frequently circulated at the front.</p>
            <p>Clark entered the "skirmish" as an eighteen-year-old boy, wide-eyed and dependent
                    upon the voices and opinions of neighbors and family. Amid the reality of a war that he soon
                    recognized would not be resolved in a matter of months, he grew, not only putting on pounds in
                    weight but also pounds in intellect that would evaluate and process the sights, sounds, and opinions
                    he faced daily in camp, on picket duty, and in the trenches. He becomes someone who warns his
                    younger brother not to join the army and who, one year from enlistment, evaluates his reasons for
                    going to war and finds them lacking. His words mirror the actions of many Hoosier Democrats who
                    opposed Governor Oliver P. Morton and President Abraham Lincoln.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

                        South,<hi rend="sup">9</hi> and Clark recorded many of its exploits in his letters home. Writing
                    almost every Sunday to his parents as he had been taught to do back in the Sabbath schools in
                    Indiana, he recreates the life of a Union Army private—the rations or lack of rations,
                    the cold, wet nights, the promised pay that came late, the gouging by the sutler, the constant need
                    for stamps, and the lack of letters from home. The son of a farmer, Clark looks upon the countryside
                    as a farmer, commenting about the weather, the crops, and the trees that he encounters on his
                    three-year journey through the southern states. Politics and religion were two chief concerns in
                    Indiana prior to the war; in Clark' letters they continue to be important topics during the
                    war. <list type="footnotes">

               </figure> Clark drank up news from any source because of the absence of it at the front. Rumors
                    written in newspapers or passed along by visiting troops were fact until, as the days passed, they
                    were not realized or were proven false. Clark learned that friends had died, that girls he knew had
                    married, and that the certainty of a quick war was not so certain. Life was going on without him
                    back home as he trekked through a war that seemed to provide little honor to an Indiana Democrat.
                    Not every Hoosier soldier backed Morton and the Union leaders' policies as Clark'
                    letters so graphically reveal. In addition to his political comments, Clark laments not having a
                    good gospel sermon once a week and mentions seeking churches in the South to attend. He notes the
                    death of the regiment' chaplain, John R. Eddy, by a mortar shell, recognizing that even the
                    servants of the church were not immune from death by war.</p>
            <p>Clark' letters begin in the prose of a young man, with slices of camp and army life jotted
                    down hastily: "I am well and geting fat. I weigh 158 pounds. I have been on guard twice. We
                    are getting our Uniform today and will get our pay tomorrow and our arms Tuesday. We will go South
                    the last of this week" (August 17, 1862). Later, as Clark questions his reasons for
                    enlisting, his political comments become more pronounced, even after he hints that speaking about
                    politics makes him uncomfortable because his ideas might be misinterpreted by people at home: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Camp life is so lonesome without a variety of reading matter, and I dont get as many letters
                            as I did at first. I have Curtailed some of my Correspondance. I found that some of them
                            tried to get me to commit myself, and that some wrote me so they could have something to
                            Story about. I think I will save my Credit by writing only to those that I know to be my
                            friends [June 21, 1863].</p>
                    </quote>
                    <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-091-1-092"/> As the war continues, Clark' sentences become longer,
                    more complex, reflecting perhaps the complexity of his situation. Even in battlefield circumstances,
                    his words—as his tour of duty becomes two years and then three years—are more
                    succinct, more concise, more poignant. At one point, when he admits having shot someone, he simply
                    conveys his denial of murder, his fear, and his refusal to believe that the man behind the log is
                    dead by saying, "I was on the line two hours longer. But saw nothing more of
                    him…. I think it was the narrowest escape I have made" (May 30, 1864).</p>
            <p>Clark' letters were his lifeline. He scavenged for paper, sometimes using gunpowder and
                    blackberry juice as ink. At the height of the battle for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName>, discouraged, tired, and sick, he asks the rhetorical question, "Now how am I
                    to keep posted [on political matters] unless I have the material to write for the requisite
                    information" (August 7, 1864)? Without stamps, paper, pen, ink, or envelopes, his ties to
                    home and his past were severed, leaving Clark to confront his own mortality.</p>
            <p>During the Civil War Clark indeed experienced many positive things that he would have missed back

                    </placeName>, gorgeous cypress woods, the kindness of southern hospitality toward Union
                    soldiers—but he also saw desertions, camp followers, gambling, gruesome battlefield
                    wounds, and countless deaths. He participated in some of the war' major battles,
                        <geogName>Stones River</geogName>, Chickamauga, the siege of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He gave three years of his life for a cause that he questioned and debated up until
                    his discharge. He was eighteen when he enlisted, but within a year he was calling new
                    eighteen-year-old recruits "green" and not soldier material—poignant
                    evidence of Clark' own maturation during his tour of duty.</p>
            <p>The value of Clark' letters rests in part in the regularity with which this articulate young
                    Hoosier wrote his parents. More importantly, the correspondence documents the effects of the Civil
                    War upon a boy, and ultimately upon a man, who was ambivalent about the war and the politics of the
                    war. Neither unwavering in his belief in the justification for the conflict nor wholehearted in his
                    sympathy for the South, Clark was undoubtedly typical of a number of Hoosier soldiers. He knew he
                    was taking part in a fight of such magnitude that it would forever change politics in Indiana and in
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. He knew he did not like many of those changes, but the alternative, too, was
                    unpalatable. Clark asked his parents to save his letters so that he might reread them when and if he
                    returned home. David and Mary Clark were already doing so because they, too, were moved by their
                    son' words. They read with worry, shock, and at times amusement the accounts of their son,
                    who left home a slogan-shouting boy and returned a man who had discovered that slogans did not win a
                    war, only men and the expense of their lives. Feisty, Clark wrote his political views discreetly <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-091-1-093"/> in his letters home, thumbing his nose at Republicans, army
                    censors, and his fellow soldiers who supported Lincoln and Morton.</p>
            <p>Following the death of Clark' granddaughter June Clark Voss in 1974, the letters reproduced
                    below and in three subsequent issues of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> were
                    discovered—complete with envelopes—in an old, white, stained shoe box in the
                    basement of Voss' home in Eureka, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> The letters reflect Clark' education and his writing
                    skill, and Clark himself guided their editing. In one letter home he reminds his younger brother
                    George to put periods at the end of sentences and to capitalize proper names. Written on the
                    battlefield and in leaky tents, with handmade quill pens dipped in ink that bled through thin paper,
                    Clark' letters are for the most part quite legible. They survive today as a legacy of early
                    Indiana and of Hoosier Democrats who seriously questioned the Union they saw emerging from the war
                    yet who fought—and died—to preserve it.</p>

                        Someone had apparently thought the stamps more valuable than the letters.</item>

                              <hi rend="sup">1</hi> William Allen Clark guided the following transcription
                                        of his correspondence by reminding his brother George, in a letter of January 9,
                                        1865, to place periods at the end of sentences and to capitalize proper names.
                                        Probably in part because of the difficult circumstances under which he wrote,
                                        Clark himself did not use apostrophes in his letters; his periods, commas, and
                                        pen pauses all resembled one another; and his capitalization was haphazard. In
                                        recognition of Clark' obvious knowledge of grammar, correct punctuation
                                        has been placed at the ends of sentences, commas have been added throughout the
                                        letters to facilitate reading, and words that begin sentences have been
                                        capitalized. In other instances Clark' capitalization, whenever clear,
                                        remains unchanged; in case of doubt the rules of modem usage were followed. Some
                                        decisions regarding sentence divisions were necessarily arbitrary, and the
                                        letters have also been arbitrarily divided into paragraphs. The location and
                                        spacing of headings, salutations, and closings have been standardized.
                                        Clark' spelling, which was quite good, has been retained. Two letters
                                        from David C. Clark to his son have been inserted in their proper chronological

                                        half and often were not available. Soldiers also supplemented rations by
                                        foraging. Details were sent out to bring back food from nearby farms where
                                        receipts that could be redeemed by the army quartermaster were to be issued to
                                        the farmers or landowners. Foraging was frequently abused, however, and often
                                        soldiers plundered for food. Faust, <hi rend="i">Historical Times Illustrated

                                    River road last night about 2 miles from Camp on picket. Our position was in the
                                    woods. One of our boys went away with the Officer of the day. About Sundown the boy
                                    went to town. The Officer to another Station. About 10 o clock the boy was coming
                                    back and the Officer also. They came to gether at a gate which the officer had been
                                    to. There was some words passed and the boy prepared to shoot the officer then ran
                                    to camp and raised the camp. Got a company to go with him to the spot and came to
                                    us. I was on the post at the time they came. They enquired into the matter, took the
                                    boy and I donot [know] what will be the end. His name was Ira Cue. This is a

                                            origin than any state in the Old Northwest, a situation that had not changed
                                            appreciably by the time of the Civil War. Many of these southern-born
                                            Hoosiers had left the South to escape competition with the large
                                            slaveholding plantations; and they feared the economic, as well as the
                                            social, results of a large influx of free blacks to Indiana. Article XIII of
                                            the state Constitution of 1851 forbade Negroes and mulattoes to come into or
                                            settle in the Hoosier state and severely restricted those already residing
                                            there. Although many Hoosiers by the time of the Civil War were increasingly
                                            uneasy about slavery as an institution and many, perhaps most, believed that
                                            slavery should not be extended, most also believed in the inferiority of the
                                            black race. Very few Hoosiers could be termed abolitionists: freedom,
                                            suffrage, and equality for blacks were not acceptable issues. As one county

                                            his belief in blacks' inferiority does not stand in the way of his
                                            faith in the Union and the Union' preservation. He is an advocate
                                            of states' rights but not of secession. For a discussion of

                                            for the North, Confederate casualties were proportionately greater than the
                                            Union losses, and the South did not again attempt a major invasion of the
                                            Bluegrass state. Denney, <hi rend="i">Civil War Years</hi>, 224; Boatner,

                                            Augustus either supplied a substitute, as was acceptable, or was exempted
                                            for some other reason. No evidence has been found to indicate that he ever

                                        significant gains in both national and state contests. In Indiana the Democratic

                                    precious. I have 7 or 8 letters now that I have not had time to answer or stamps to
                                    send them with, but the stamps you sent will make it pretty near right. But keep

                                        neighboring houses for meals. If the residents were agreeable, meals could be
                                        purchased. Foraging was often called the army' "euphemism for
                                        stealing," and Clark, a farmer' son who was raised on
                                        Christian ethics, apparently preferred paying for a meal rather than

                                        jaundice with 414 deaths during the Civil War. Measles were prevalent because
                                        many soldiers coming from rural areas had not been exposed to the disease, and
                                        it plagued the army until the war' end, often delaying troop movements

                                        accidents and disease than because of battlefield deaths. Soldiers suffered from
                                        inadequate medical supplies, poor living conditions, a lack of healthful foods,
                                        and little medical knowledge of disease and how it spread. Men dreaded going to
                                        hospitals because they often got sicker there as a result of infection and
                                        unclean conditions. It has been estimated that Union and Confederate losses
                                        totaled 204,070 men killed or mortally wounded and that 308,755 died from

                                    the Regt. down with the Jaundice. But it is nearly through. I have not had it. The
                                    Boys say that I look better every day. A. Sale, and L. Cloe are sick yet. William

                                    spits some Blood. Sam Hefner and George Herr have the measles. The Regt. is now on

                                            captain was probably preparing a list of his requests and belongings in case
                                            of death. Reed was discharged on February 2, 1863. Terrell, <hi rend="i">Report of the Adjutant General</hi>, VI, 179. Throughout the war
                                            federal, state, and local authorities offered bounties to encourage
                                            enlistments. The federal government paid from $25.00 to
                                            $400.00 depending on the time and length of enlistment. State and
                                            local organizations offered bounties in an effort to avoid conscription,
                                            which was usually considered a disgrace in the districts that had to resort
                                            to it. Estimates indicate that federal Civil War bounties totaled
                                            approximately $300,000,000 and that during the last two years of
                                            the war state and local payments probably equaled this amount. Federal
                                            bounties were paid over a period of time rather than in one lump sum.

                                            such as paper, ink, newspapers, razors, etc. Although the article of war
                                            prescribed that "persons permitted to sutle shall supply the

                                            the war lengthened, by selling hard to find items at exorbitant prices.

                                        government notes, or "greenbacks," paper currency issued by
                                        the federal government in 1862 to help finance the war. Not backed by gold and
                                        inherently inflationary, the greenbacks' value fluctuated with the
                                        fortunes of the Union Army. By midyear, 1862, greenbacks were worth only
                                        $.91 in gold. The currency remained popular, however, particularly
                                        among Westerners, and southern sympathizers in occupied territory willingly
                                        accepted it in lieu of the worthless Confederate currency. Faust, <hi rend="i">Historical Times Illustrated Encyclopedia</hi>, 323, 432-33.</item>

                                    one for S. S. and one for self, being the first for nearly two weeks. Was glad to
                                    hear that you retain good health in the midst of so much sickness as we hear there
                                    is in the different camps. You complain of being forgotten at home. If you could
                                    know the feelings of a mother or father, you would not think so. You say you dont
                                    hear from home very often. Think the fault is not mine as I write and mail a letter
                                    once each week and send stamps in the most of them. You say you have peace reports
                                    in the army. We have nothing of the kind here except among abolitionists, who seem
                                    to think the first of january will produce a change in the minds of the rebels,
                                    which will make them lay down their arms and embrace the opportunity of saving their
                                    slaves, a thing very much to [be] doubted I think, but wish it may prove true.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>

                                        of which they did not approve and for which they were not disposed to fight.
                                        David C. Clark, an anti-abolitionist, obviously doubts the effectiveness of the
                                        measure. Eric Foner and John A. Garraty, eds., <hi rend="i">The Reader'

                              <hi rend="sup">55</hi> In 1861 the civil township was the basic administrative
                                        unit and a single township trustee the chief administrator for the public
                                        schools in Indiana. Each township, however, was divided into districts according
                                        to the number of schools therein, and in each district locally elected directors
                                        served as a link between the trustee and patrons of the school. According to the
                                        law, directors were to preside over district meetings in which patrons could,
                                        among other things, designate the teacher they wanted hired; trustees were to
                                        accede to their mandate. Apparently, the director in the Clarks'
                                        district had ignored the law, and George had been sent to another school. John

                                        Various loan plans failed, and the resort to paper money, or script, stimulated
                                        inflation, which reached, overall, approximately 6,000 percent. Foner and

                    </placeName>, Indiana, recording company that made monumental contributions to music history. It was
                    a company that sold millions of records in the early 1920s; a company whose catalogue included such
                    widely diverse items as marimba bands, Hawaiian bands, symphony orchestras, comedy recordings,
                    political speeches (including those of the Ku Klux Klan), and specialty discs; a company that was
                    singular in catering to both the segregated white and black record markets; a company whose growth
                    paralleled that of the emerging phenomena of jazz, rural blues, and country music—new
                    genres on the fringe of the music mainstream.</p>
            <p>This book is, however, much more than just a history of Gennett Records. It is, among other things,
                    an accounting of the beginnings of the American recording industry, exploring such events as Thomas
                    Edison' invention of the cylinder phonograph in 1877, Emil Berliner' development
                    of the gramophone, and the intriguing and often rancorous legal battles among early recording giants
                    Victor, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Edison which resulted in the declaration that the recording techniques controlled
                    by Victor were public domain. It is also a fascinating picture of a period when smaller phonograph
                    and record companies were generally divisions of manufacturers of furniture products, and the
                    merchandising of records was conducted by such businesses as Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company and
                    the Kresge variety chain.</p>
            <p>For the jazz buff this book provides an interesting and insightful look at the recordings of some of
                    jazz' seminal figures and chronicles the debut recordings of such giants as the <placeName>

                    State," that is particularly relevant to readers with a special interest in Indiana
                    history.</p>

            <p>A wonderful surprise to this reviewer was the chapter, "Rural Recordings in the Electronic
                    Era," that documents Gennett' recording activity in the genres of country music,
                    rural blues, and piano blues (boogie woogie). Of country music the author writes:
                    "Collectively, the thousands of titles issued on Gennett and its affiliated budget labels
                    contributed substantially to the massive body of old time records issued by a handful of record
                    companies in the late 1920s and early 1930s … [that] form the bedrock of today'
                    country music record industry" (pp. 151-52). This chapter also covers some of the
                    world' greatest blues singers who recorded at the Gennett Studios, including Jesse Crump,
                    Thomas A. Dorsey, Big Bill Broonzy, Sam Collins, Scrapper Blackwell, Leroy Carr, and Roosevelt
                    Sykes. Prophetically, blues great Charlie Patton recorded his first album there (6-14-29) and blues
                    giant Blind Lemon Jefferson his last album (8-24-29).</p>

            <p>Photographic collections are often problematic for historians. While the images are often attractive,
                    they may be orphans with little or no documentation of the subject matter. Published collections of
                    unidentified photographs function only as nostalgia or as generalized portraits of life
                    "way back when." The more information the editor of a book of photographs can
                    provide the more valuable the images become to the historian without losing any appeal to readers
                    with less rigorous demands.</p>
            <p>Cecil K. Byrd has assembled a fine collection of photographs of life in southern Indiana during the
                    first half of the twentieth century. To produce this book Byrd worked for over a year with the
                    seventeen-thousand-plus photographs and negatives in the Hohenberger Manuscripts housed at the Lilly
                    Library at Indiana University. He edited the final selection of photographs down to 124. Then, using
                    Frank M. Hohenberger' notes and the identification information filed with the photographs,
                    he "went everywhere there was a photograph" that would be used in the book and
                    gathered more material for the captions. These captions give the photographs a historical value that
                    rivals their charm and nostalgic appeal. Byrd has enriched the viewers' enjoyment of these
                    photographs by placing them in the context of time and place.</p>
            <p>Frank M. Hohenberger was an excellent photographer with an apparent love of rural life and an eye for
                    detail. His photographs <pb n="[112]" id="VAA4025-091-1-118"/>

                    Georgia Costin. (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1994. Pp. xi, 268. Notes,
                    bibliography, index. $24.95.)</head>
            <p>If you think that all members of a Catholic religious community live a life of prayer, obedience, and
                    discipline, you will need to read this volume. Sister Mary <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> Costin, historian of the Sisters of the Holy Cross, covers the period from the founding
                    of her community in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> to the death of the Reverend Edward Sorin, the sisters' father superior and
                    the founder of nearby University of Notre Dame.</p>
            <p>The author valiantly seeks to rehabilitate Sorin by relating his real concern for the spiritual and
                    physical health of the sisters and his paternal gentleness with the truly troubled. She is only
                    partially successful, for her heavy reliance on the same letters and memoirs used by earlier
                    historians leads her to some of the traditional conclusions—Sorin was imperious,
                    demanding, impetuous, and unwilling to admit mistakes. She reports several telling incidents. He
                    publicly humiliated a sister who had gone to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> for medical attention without his permission (he was in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> at the time). When his list of sisters ready for profession was submitted to the mother
                    general in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> for her approval, he quit as the sisters' father superior.</p>
            <p>Costin traces the rapid Americanization of her order. Holy Cross Sisters in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> were primarily engaged in domestic work and so were the first arrivals in America. Soon
                    they began to care <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-091-1-120"/> for orphans and the deaf and to instruct
                    young women. They taught the liberal subjects, music, needlework, and manners. By 1859 American
                    recruits (frequently of Irish ancestry) outnumbered the French-born sisters 144 to 32. They rapidly
                    responded to Indiana Governor Oliver P. Morton' call for nurses and staffed five military
                    hospitals during the Civil War. Sorin could view their separation from the motherhouse overseas as a
                    major step toward his freedom from outside control; but for the sisters in a predominately American
                    community with a midwestern apostolate, separation meant that their American leadership would be
                    better able to understand and react to American needs and conditions than French superiors who were
                    several weeks away by letter.</p>
            <p>Generally community histories gloss over the rough spots and stress the sanctity and wisdom of
                    founders and past leaders. Costin scrutinizes, evaluates, and corrects previous studies of community
                    personages, especially the biographies of Holy Cross founder the Reverend Basil Anthony Moreau and
                    the hastily researched lives of the community' general superiors written a half-century
                    ago. She questions the accuracy of memoirs, examines the community' pious myths, and
                    rattles skeletons (alcoholism, infidelity, pettiness, misunderstandings, jealousy, mental illness),
                    thereby reminding readers that religious remain subject to human frailties during their search for
                    godliness. Costin believes that she will be the last historian to recount the first fifty years of
                    her community' development. In her search for the "last word" she
                    fascinates readers with her sharp, critical look at the "priceless spirit" of her
                    community' pioneers. She shows that single-spaced quotations and superscripts do not
                    detract from the telling of an interesting, important, and honest story.</p>

            <p>Northern Indiana is home to one of the country' major Amish communities. The Amish first
                    migrated to America in 1714, settling in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. The need for land caused them to look westward. The country in and around <placeName>
                        <region type="county">LaGrange</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Elkhart counties</region>
                    </placeName> in Indiana was determined a good place to settle, and the first families moved to this
                    area in 1841.</p>
            <p>Religion is the basis of Amish life. It defines clothing, furnishings, toys, and more. But there are
                    differences in religious opinion <pb n="115" id="VAA4025-091-1-121"/> among the Amish, differences
                    which have led to variations in lifestyles. Some drive automobiles, others hold public office, still
                    others own businesses. Still, there are those who prescribe strictly to a life that excludes the
                    outside world. Even with differences in religious belief, the separate churches and the people live
                    in harmony.</p>
            <p>Quilts are an exception to the quiet ways of the Amish. Colorful expressions of life and nature, the
                    quilts are sought by individuals and museums alike, and approximately one-third of this book is
                    dedicated to them. More than forty photographs of quilts appear in the book, which also includes a
                    narrative on the crafts women who are responsible for design and construction. Kathleen McLary is to
                    be commended for encouraging the Indiana State Museum to acquire this excellent collection; the
                    museum is to be commended for listening to her. In fact, <hi rend="i">Amish Style: Clothing, Home
                        Furnishing, Toys, Dolls, and Quilts</hi> is in many ways an exhibition catalogue on the
                    museum' fine collection. Each chapter includes an introduction to the topic and excellent
                    photographs of objects in the museum collection or representative of Amish life.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to research and write about the Amish because they are a very private people. It is
                    even more difficult to photograph them because they respect the scriptural passage "Thou
                    shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven
                    above" (Exod. 20:4). In spite of these difficulties McLary has put together a book that
                    serves as a good introduction to some of the complex issues of Amish life. Those readers who are
                    interested in more than a glimpse, however, will want to consult other publications that delve more
                    deeply into Amish traditions, beliefs, and lifestyles.</p>

                    </placeName>, 1993. Pp. viii, 241. Tables, figures, notes, index. $35.00.)</head>
            <p>Robert A. Catlin chaired the Department of Minority Studies at Indiana University Northwest, Gary,
                    from 1982 to 1987 and was an advisor to Mayor Richard G. Hatcher. The book deals mainly with those
                    years. It is purportedly a guidebook for "Type II" cities like
                    Gary—those with a black majority, with a black mayor, but without Fortune 500 corporate
                    headquarters, major universities, and large medical centers. (Type I cities have
                    "placebound" institutions requiring their white leaders to work with black elected
                    officials.)</p>
            <p>Catlin emphasizes the failure of leaders in the private and public sector to cooperate and both
                    parties‘ (mostly whites') jealousy and racism. Despite the perception of
                    Gary' high unemployment, <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-091-1-122"/> crime, and decayed
                    infrastructure, he insists that the city could be part of a renaissance similar to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newark</settlement>
                    </placeName>'. Racial Politics and Urban Planning deals mostly with Catlin' three
                    major city projects—preparing the first comprehensive plan in twenty years; leading
                    opposition to "Metrolake," an ill-fated plan to consolidate the northern three <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake County</region>
                    </placeName> townships into one metropolitan government; and chairing the Gary Airport Promotion and
                    Development Commission.</p>
            <p>Given Gary' distinctive history and Catlin' close ties to Hatcher, the novice
                    urbanist might wonder about the applicability of the author' findings to other cities.
                    Catlin insists that Gary punctures three myths—that blacks cannot manage or govern; that
                    political empowerment does not transfer to economic empowerment; and that whites will be fair to
                    blacks if it is in their self-interest. His material suggests a more complex story. Mayor
                    Hatcher' anti-business rhetoric and black militancy from 1967 to 1984 contributed to the
                    Gary business community' and the <hi rend="i">Post-Tribune</hi>' vehement
                    opposition to him. His successor' rhetoric differed, as did his experience with white
                    leadership. (The author lamely asserts that both men were right for their times: a more agreeable
                    black leader from the late 1960s to the early 1980s would have surrendered the interests of blacks
                    and had limited tenure.) Hatcher' pettiness left Gary airport interests without a pilot for
                    two years while the site of the third <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> airport was being decided. Catlin argues that the only universal solution for all three
                    hundred majority-black cities and urban places is massive federal and state funding. Yet the
                    experience of Gary, which received over $300 million in federal funding during the first
                    twelve Hatcher years, suggests that "projectitis" and highly partisan use of such
                    funds could follow.</p>
            <p>Historians will find this somewhat useful as a firsthand perspective but question the
                    author' analysis. Among the "external constraints" on urban planning and
                    development, U. S. Steel is depicted as having taken no active role in local civic life after 1934
                    when Democrats gained control of local government. Again, Catlin' evidence suggests a more
                    complicated story. The lack of a major institution of higher education in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake County</region>
                    </placeName> may be explained by the presence until the early 1980s of high-paying industrial jobs
                    that made college attendance unappealing. Repeated charges of institutionalized white racism wear a
                    bit thin. And some key issues are neglected-for instance, the role of the black newspaper, Gary <hi rend="i">INFO</hi>, and Catlin' leaving Gary in 1987. Was this related to
                    Hatcher' defeat in the primary?</p>
            <p>Errors in fact, grammar, typography, and syntax also limit the book' appeal.</p>

            <p>This visually beautiful book is a significant extended historical essay and a descriptive checklist
                    for an exhibition that ran from October, 1993, through May, 1994, at the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Historical Society. The two-part volume begins with the David Hackett Fischer essay
                    followed by a longer cataloguing of the two hundred items that were on exhibit. In both parts
                    pictures and maps abound, complementing and enlivening the Fischer essay. The descriptive and
                    gemlike commentaries in the catalogue stand on their own as well as serve to enhance the historical
                    narrative. Altogether the sum is greater than the parts.</p>
            <p>Fischer has been a major contributor to American history for a generation. His <hi rend="i">Albion' Seed</hi> in 1989, the first of a series of five books intended to
                    "comprise a cultural history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>" (p. vii), was a tour de force for American colonial cultural, social, and
                    economic history. Then came the extended essay in the volume under review, followed in 1994 by <hi rend="i">Paul Revere' Ride</hi>, which received high praise as a great story and as a
                    serious inquiry into the meaning of liberty during the American Revolution.</p>
            <p>With James C. Kelly, Fischer, in keeping with his grand plan in <hi rend="i">Albion'
                    Seed</hi>, has presented a major comment on the significance of the West in American history, always
                    from the special vantage point of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. His perspectives are noteworthy as they contrast with those of Frederick Jackson
                    Turner and the "new western historians." Furthermore, many, if not most of the
                    historians who have written about the American West, starting with Turner, have viewed American
                    history looking from west to east. Not so Fischer. Elaborating upon his discussions in <hi rend="i">Albion' Seed.</hi> Fischer begins his story in <placeName>
                  <country reg="enk">England</country>, <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>, which, in addition to Europe, Africa, and the eastern woodlands of America, he sees as
                    the proper beginning points for the various and varied people of the American West. His treatment of
                    the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century internal migration patterns sets a cultural and political
                    stage for the great expansion of the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>Fischer' view that a modified version of the germ theory best explains the nature of the
                    movement west shows that after <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana ranked highest among those northern states that became home for transplanted
                    Virginians. In the South only <placeName>

                    </placeName> outranked the Hoosier state. The treatment of the movement into Indiana is too brief,
                    but overall the essay does serve to embellish an already rich Indiana historiography on cultural and
                    demographic origins. For example, those readers of Oliver Johnson' <pb n="[118]" id="VAA4025-091-1-124"/>

            <p>Charles H. Titus was a pious Down-Easter who came to Indiana in 1841 to teach and to become one of
                    the earliest graduates of Indiana Asbury (now DePauw) University. He and his new wife then directed
                    the Male and Female Seminary at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, only to leave in disappointment in the spring of' 1843. Whether they had ever
                    intended to grow up with the country is not revealed. But thereafter, before taking up a life as a
                    Methodist itinerant preacher in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, Titus traveled by railroad, stagecoach, canal boat, lake steamer, brigantine, and
                    canoe, circuitously from southern Indiana to the head of Lake Superior, on a visit to Methodist
                    mission stations among the Sioux and Chippewa. Titus edited his own journal of this expedition, and
                    it is this finally published travel account that forms the heart of this book.</p>
            <p>Titus' eye for detail and for the incongruous was positively Dickensian; his descriptions of
                    stagecoach and canal boat travel are certainly worthy of <hi rend="i">American Notes</hi> and its
                    author. Titus was generally sympathetic to the West and its development, though he clearly felt more
                    at home among New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> immigrants than he did among Hoosiers. He shared the anti-Catholicism of most
                    nineteenth-century <pb n="120" id="VAA4025-091-1-126"/> American Protestants and was repelled by the
                    visible Romanism at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> and at backcountry missions. But his distaste for Native Americans was particularly
                    strong, revealed both through prejudice, in his account of General Josiah Harmar' defeat,
                    and from observation on Lake Superior. He concluded that missionary activity among Indians was
                    simply unnecessary and futile. Indeed he shared nothing of the Romantics’ enthusiasm for
                    unspoiled humans and unspoiled nature. "The roaring cascade, the lofty, craggy rocks, the
                    dense and almost impenetrable forest that still remained as nature had formed it, &amp; the
                    natives of the wood that stood around me, all strove in vain to arrest my attention," he
                    wrote. "My thoughts were far away in the land of the Christian, where God is known
                    &amp; worshiped, &amp; the blessings of a civilized life abound (p. 119). Within a year of
                    writing this, Titus returned to the steady habits of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, where he remained the rest of his life.</p>
            <p>George P. Clark has done well to bring this account of Yankee perspectives on western life to light
                    and to provide it with extraordinarily complete annotation. It is a worthy addition to the honorable
                    genre of western travel literature.</p>

                    of this state but they provide models for study of other states in the region, in fact of the
                    nation.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century when <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> entered the Union, its population was quite small, but each decennial census revealed
                    an amazing increase. New Englanders migrating into the state' northern counties and
                    southerners up from the Carolinas, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>

                    </placeName> made for a mixture of people building a midwestern culture in many aspects.</p>
            <p>Early on, as the Federalist party disappeared, the dominant political persuasion was Jeffersonian
                    Republican, withal internal differences. And nearly everyone, it seemed, preferred a republican
                    label of some kind. Nevertheless, the catalyst of Jacksonianism restored a two-party system, Whigs
                    and Democrats; and like other <pb n="121" id="VAA4025-091-1-127"/> Americans, Ohioans divided at
                    election time on economic issues. Whigs called for an active government to provide internal
                    improvements, adequate financial institutions, and encouragement of industrial development.
                    Democrats wanted much the same things but would rely upon individualism with minimal governmental
                    intervention. The great movement of digging canals and constructing roads and railroads reflected a
                    Whig solution, as one of these essays demonstrates, while the craze of land buying followed a
                    Democratic formula with low prices and mass purchasing by actual settlers at public land offices.
                    Better than the early days of speculators getting hold of immense tracts, it was said. Another
                    essay, however, shows that individual settlers were also speculators and, as such, had a more
                    beneficial impact than once supposed. Overall, as many historians have pointed out, this was a
                    period of the market revolution, in which Buckeye citizens participated and by which their political
                    faith took shape.</p>
            <p>Increasingly, certainly by the early 1840s, sectional differences on slavery pushed economic issues
                    aside, a fact that had important effects upon party structure and behavior. The free-soil movement
                    brought Salmon P. Chase, Joshua R. Giddings, Benjamin Tappan, and many others to the cause of
                    preventing western extension of slavery, soon the foundation of a new Republican party. <placeName>

                    </placeName> became a leading state in this transformation; and it was no coincidence that John C.
                    Frémont, a favorite there, got the presidential nomination in 1856. It was the beginning
                    of <placeName>

            <p>There is much more that these essays have to say about the political terrain than space in this
                    review permits—primitive and fraudulent election practices, constant appeals to public
                    interest while pursuing private gain, self-serving reasons for politicians to change party
                    affiliations, all were elements of this political culture. As the editors assess such factors, they
                    emphasize the great complexity of politics, demanding caution by historians often quick to
                    oversimplify their explanations. One may give these authors credit for avoiding such hazards in this
                    useful publication.</p>

            <p>In this study of early jazz William Howland Kenney brings together two genres that still do not mix
                    often enough—jazz studies and cultural history. Exploring the relationship of jazz and
                    its urban context, he tries especially to lay out "some of the interactive process between
                    music and the specific night-life institutions that presented jazz" (p. xii). The result is
                    a vivid tour of long-gone clubs <pb n="122" id="VAA4025-091-1-128"/> and dance halls. Kenney moves

                    South State Street, he takes the reader into the Savoy Ballroom, the first big black dance hall, and

            <p>On this excursion Kenney presents <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> jazz as the product of a distinct historical moment: the black migration from the South
                    to a midwestern city with a "booming economy, machine politics, rebellion against
                    prohibition moralism, and increased inter-racial awareness" (p. 148). In this setting
                    African-American musicians could create the new sounds that filled all those clubs and dance halls
                    and helped to establish a realm of nighttime entertainment during the 1910s and 1920s.</p>
            <p>Kenney shows how jazz was rooted in de facto segregation, in the separate black world of saloons,
                    cafes, pool halls, vaudeville, movies, and politics on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>' South Side. There, the pioneering jazz musicians came to terms with what
                    Kenney calls the "transforming power" (p. 43) of the city. In line with the
                    cultural and social history of the last thirty years, he stresses that, although these men changed
                    their dress, deportment, and music, they did not lose their distinctive African-American identity.
                    Chicago jazz was the product of "cross-cultural synthesis" (p. 561, not cultural
                    suppression.</p>
            <p>Kenney also shows how jazz gradually reached into the white world, thanks in part to the
                    black-and-tans where white and African-American patrons could mix and to the handful of whites-only
                    venues where black musicians could play. He nicely demonstrates the jolting impact of
                    African-American music on a generation of young white musicians. More daringly—and less
                    persuasively—Kenney tries to argue that jazz was a medium of interracial
                    "reconciliation" (p. xiv). But he never establishes the music' power to
                    harmonize white and black.</p>
            <p>In all, Kenney tells an interesting but largely familiar story. The merger of jazz studies and
                    cultural history is surely as important as he maintains, but here it does not lead to a particularly
                    new perspective on the music or the culture.</p>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is well chronicled. Nina Mjagkij' book describes the intersection of <pb n="123" id="VAA4025-091-1-129"/> one such institution, the Young Men' Christian
                    Association (YMCA), with segregation and racism. The book details the impact of racial isolation on
                    attempts by African Americans, often with the help of their white counterparts, to form segregated
                    YMCA branches. As Mjagkij describes it, this arrangement fit perfectly into the plans of the
                    mid-nineteenth century "Christian brotherhood to create a "separate but
                    equal" YMCA for African Americans. According to Mjagkij, it also fit the needs of the
                    African-American community: "Faced with emasculation through lynchings, disfranchisement,
                    race riots, and jim crow laws, the educated elite established YMCAs as sanctuaries where
                    African-American men could be men and African-American boys could become men" (p. 7).</p>
            <p>Mjagkij' book recounts changes in the role of the African-American YMCA secretariat, the
                    growth of the YMCA in African-American colleges and universities, and the service of
                    African-American YMCA members to military units as teachers and tutors for illiterate soldiers
                    during World War I. The mounting post-World War I pressure from returning military personnel,
                    particularly those who served overseas, made it difficult for the YMCA to continue its
                    segregationist philosophy without strong resistance from the African-American secretaries and their
                    membership. The postwar movement led to a reorganization of the YMCA and the creation of a colored
                    work department which was responsible for all African-American branches.</p>
            <p>The YMCA did not escape the financial strain of the depression years. Resignations, layoffs, and
                    reductions of staff were common occurrences during the 1930s. The role of white philanthropists as
                    well as that of Madam C. J. Walker of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> are highlighted in the text. Daily activities at the Senate Avenue YMCA of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> are also noted.</p>
            <p>Mjagkij describes the slow growth of resistance to segregated facilities until the worldwide
                    explosion of rhetoric about democratic ideals during World War II. According to Mjagkij, most
                    African-American YMCA secretaries prior to the buildup that led to World War II followed Booker T.
                    Washington' call for accommodation and gradual change. Both the international and national
                    pressure to desegregate the YMCA led to a resolution in 1946 that dissolved the colored work
                    department, abolished racial designations, and urged local associations to desegregate.</p>
            <p>Within the book there is a description of the change in African-American YMCA secretaries and other
                    African-American leaders during World War II. The secretaries began to collaborate with other
                    organizations such as the Urban League, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
                    and Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters to discuss the military effort, defense industry, and scores
                    of other issues that were seen as roadblocks to equality and progress for African Americans. By 1946
                    African-American YMCAs were seen in major cities around the country as <pb n="124" id="VAA4025-091-1-130"/> places for social interaction, professional networking, and male
                    bonding for African-American men.</p>
            <p>This valuable book is reinforced by very informative appendixes and notes. The appendixes list
                    statistical information about African-American YMCAs and their secretaries for the period covered by
                    the book, and the notes give scores of resources for those who are searching for more information
                    than is readily available in this slim volume. The bibliography is also extensive and very

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Way of the Cross Leads Home</hi> is a history of American Methodism during its most
                    dynamic period—1784—1850—and in the place—the
                        <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> and the Old Northwest-where more than anywhere else it
                    developed the institutional pattern that allowed it to grow into America' most
                    representative religion. A. Gregory Schneider emphasizes how post-Revolutionary Methodism broke with
                    the earlier—presumably Anglican-related—patriarchal family, which was based
                    upon the culture of honor, to produce a religious fellowship that viewed itself as an extended
                    family and that in turn produced individual family units based upon affection, spiritual nurture,
                    and protection from an evil world. Before 1830 the primary agency for promoting experiential
                    religion was less the frontier camp meeting than the weekly class meeting supplemented by the
                    quarterly "love feasts." Then during the middle decades of the nineteenth century
                    as Methodism became institutionalized, it was the Methodist home that increasingly became the agency
                    for facilitating the Methodist experience of submission and obedience that the author calls
                    "the way of the cross."</p>
            <p>There is much about this book to commend. Although Schneider describes it as "primarily a
                    work of analysis," he demonstrates superb narrative skills in his sprightly descriptions of
                    Methodist institutions and practices (<hi rend="i">e.g.</hi>, circuit-riding preachers, local
                    preachers, home-based services, family devotions, prayer meetings, and fellowship and individual
                    testimonies in class meetings). Furthermore, his research is thorough, his writing is lucid, his
                    tone is fair; and he regularly employs useful insights from the related disciplines of sociology,
                    psychology, and theology.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to evaluate the interpretive aspects of the book. Schneider' effort to show
                    that Methodism played a significant role <pb n="125" id="VAA4025-091-1-131"/> in changing both
                    American religion and American homes is both compelling and overstated. Unquestionably, Methodism
                    was the single most significant denominational contributor to the movement toward heart religion and
                    domesticity in nineteenth-century America. One wishes, however, that the author had more clearly
                    placed the Methodist record in the larger context of the Second Great Awakening and the changes that
                    that movement effected toward religious seriousness, individual ability, and individualism
                    throughout Protestantism and society in general.</p>
            <p>Also, while the author shows a strong relationship between Methodism and domesticity, he exaggerates
                    the extent to which Methodism is central in explaining the importance of the family and the extent
                    to which domestication is central in explaining early Methodism. One could argue that the Methodists
                    were merely following the pattern of many other groups before and since who became a family-like
                    fellowship (note, for example, the contemporary popularity of the Bill Gaither song and hymnal,
                    "The Family of God," which is used in many denominations) or who carried their
                    evangelistic concerns to their homes. The Methodists were unique, however, in at least one important
                    respect: more than any other major nineteenth-century denomination, they provided spiritual
                    leadership opportunities for women (see chapter 12). While domestication is one useful way of
                    interpreting Methodist history, there are other modes that are no less important; some of these (the
                    importance of status and class in the rise of Methodism, the idea of separation from the world, a
                    comparison of the foundation stage and the "middle age" or institutional stage of
                    religious movements, and the importance of women) the author discusses with insight although he does
                    not focus on them. In summary, Schneider has written a good book on a subject of developing
                    interest; however, if his interpretive framework had been more broadly conceived, his good book
                    would have been an even better one.</p>

            <p>Agriculture occupies a special place in American history with images of farmers reflecting
                    Jeffersonian agrarian ideals. In a nation whose food exports now reach around the globe, farming has
                    changed from early frontier cultivation into an efficient agribusiness. Agriculture once constituted
                    the primary way of life for generations of American families; today less than 2 percent of the
                    population of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is classified as farmers.</p>
            <pb n="126" id="VAA4025-091-1-132"/>
            <p>Although R. Douglas Hurt describes this current work as a brief history, readers will perceive it as
                    a major re-analysis of this agricultural transformation. Hurt focuses more on narratives than on
                    traditional listings of statistics and employs a topical approach within chronological timeframes as
                    reflected in the context of social, political, and economic forces. His treatment is not simply
                    blind praise for hard-working farmers but a tale leavened with less desirable aspects such as greed,
                    racism, abusive farming techniques, speculation, and outright corruption. Nonetheless, his approach
                    is objectively balanced, and he poses the obviously recurring question, did American farmers wish to
                    maintain their essentially small subsistence-style operations, or were they eager participants in
                    the growing market economy with its commercial production? He maintains that many farmers viewed
                    themselves, perhaps contradictorily, as pursuers of both ends of the agricultural spectrum. Those
                    readers interested in this perspective as pertinent to agrarian values might wish to begin with
                    Hurt' stunningly perceptive essay entitled "Agrarianism" (pp. 72-77).</p>
            <p>Hurt views the period 1865-1900 as one of the most revolutionary in terms of change. Slavery ended in
                    1865, while expensive mechanization and increased demands for capital combined with unfair commodity
                    marketing to buffet helpless farmers much like straw in the wind. Clearly the Gilded Age was not
                    golden for all, and farmers suffered at the lowest rungs of the economic ladder.</p>
            <p>By the early twentieth century economic trends in terms of commodity supply and demand became more
                    favorable. Hurt comprehensively summarizes these trends in his chapter entitled the "Age of
                    Prosperity" (pp. 221-79). However, increased farm technology and policies of the federal
                    government induced many farmers into over-production by World War I. Seeds of disaster were thus
                    planted for the grim 1920s with their collapsing markets and sagging farm values followed by the
                    debacle of the Great Depression in the 1930s. In response, New Deal programs set in motion the basis
                    for ever-expanding farm programs.</p>
            <p>A popular slogan in the 1970s became "Get Bigger, Get Better or Get Out." Many
                    small and middle-sized farm operators did precisely that—often whether or not they wanted
                    to do so. Correspondingly, present-day federal farm funding concentrates more on new specialty
                    programs such as biotechnology and less on conventional price-support/loan programs. Solidly
                    researched, beautifully written, and replete with maps and illustrations, Hurt'
                    agricultural history becomes the new standard reference and is destined to be the definitive study
                    for many years in the future.</p>

            <p>The idea that anyone could take a subject as prosaic as the railroad freight car and convert it into
                    an encyclopedia of fascinating reading that runs to 644 pages and weighs eight pounds boggles the
                    mind. That, however, is exactly what John H. White, Jr., has done, and he has done it in superb
                    fashion.</p>
            <p>Although containing more than 530 photographs and drawings, many of a technical nature, this book is
                    much more than a hardware study. It traces the development of the freight car, discusses its impact
                    on society, and expands into such topics as types of traffic, invention of special cars, rates and
                    rebates, the interchange system, car leasing, private car fleets, and the American Humane
                    Association, which was established to counter perceived livestock transportation abuses.</p>
            <p>Building on the thesis that "cheap, dependable haulage of goods is essential to civilized
                    life, at least as we know it in the West" (p. x), White goes on to weave a compelling
                    account of the development of specialized cars to meet specific needs. Refrigerator cars, tankers,
                    and oyster, wine, vinegar, and molasses cars were among them. The originals, however, were flatcars,
                    gondolas developed to haul coal, and boxcars to haul almost everything else. But this was not
                    enough. Development of the hopper car reduced the amount of labor involved in moving coal, and the
                    refrigerator car made it possible to build packing plants near the supply source and ship the meat
                    to the market, a less expensive and more certain procedure than transporting the live animal.</p>
            <p>White also discusses technical details such as wheels, trucks, springs, journal boxes, couplers, and
                    brakes. He explains their development in great detail, tracing it historically and explaining the
                    needs that led to improvements. Turning to broader aspects, the author also discusses signaling,
                    effects of grades and curves, speeds, containerization and yard management, and the steps that led
                    to larger cars and longer trains.</p>

            <p>As the founder of the <hi rend="i">Confederate Veteran</hi> magazine, Sumner Archibald Cunningham
                    seemingly embodied the central values of the Lost Cause. As biographer John A. Simpson convincingly
                    shows, however, Cunningham' efforts to memorialize the Confederate experience (with the
                    accompanying personal and legal controversies) originated in the editor' own less than
                    sterling war record.</p>
            <p>Born in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Bedford County</region>, <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
               </placeName>, in 1843, Cunningham grew up in a middle-class Presbyterian
                    family. At the beginning of the Civil War, Cunningham, an anxious, nervous youth, unenthusiastically
                    enlisted in the lackluster 41st <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> Infantry Regiment. Quickly promoted to sergeant, probably because of his literacy,
                    Cunningham was captured at Fort Donelson and taken to Camp Morton in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Here he began to have second, and probably third, thoughts about the war but refused
                    to take an oath of loyalty to the Union. He was finally exchanged at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vicksburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. A combination of illness and demoralization now made him a most reluctant fighter.
                    According to Simpson' reading of the sketchy evidence, Cunningham would often be ill or
                    absent on the eve of battles and, despite a religious conversion in 1864, would never be much of a
                    soldier. After John B. Hood' disastrous <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> campaign, during which Cunningham actually showed some valor, the unwilling soldier hid
                    out as a deserter with his family.</p>
            <p>Like many former Confederates, Cunningham struggled to make a living in the postwar South; he briefly
                    ran a dry goods store but soon turned to journalism as his life' work. After stints with
                    several newspapers in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>, <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
               </placeName>, and even <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, Cunningham finally found a permanent home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. An active participant in Confederate veterans groups and one of the founders of the
                    United Confederate Veterans (UCV), Cunningham never got along with the former high ranking officers
                    who dominated the organization. Still reticent about his own military service, Cunningham
                    nevertheless established the <hi rend="i">Confederate Veteran</hi> magazine in 1893 even as he
                    continued to spar with UCV officials. The magazine' successful appeal to rank-and-file
                    soldiers made Cunningham a leading preserver of the Confederate heritage in memorials and
                    "proper" histories, yet his prickly personality ensnared him in a lengthy libel
                    suit that nearly destroyed the <hi rend="i">Confederate Veteran.</hi> Toward the end of his life
                    Cunningham successfully campaigned for a memorial to Sam Davis—a boy spy executed by the
                    Federals—and ironically a tablet for Richard Owen, the humane commandant of Camp Morton.
                    In this way, the author concludes, Cunningham finally made peace with his Confederate experience and
                    with the <placeName>

            <p>Simpson has carefully and ingeniously recorded the life of a shadowy figure. Although there is little
                    new here about the cult of the Lost Cause, the biography does full justice to its subject despite
                    the absence of extensive Cunningham manuscripts. The division of 162 pages of text into twenty-two
                    chapters makes for sometimes choppy reading, but Simpson has done a solid job of placing
                    Cunningham' troubled life in a broad historical context.</p>

            <p>This volume is the fourth in the series, Bicentennial Essays on the Bill of Rights, a series
                    resulting from a collaboration between the Organization of American Historians Committee on the
                    Bicentennial of the Constitution and Oxford University Press. The purpose of the series is to
                    promote informed understanding of the Bill of Rights by providing comprehensive surveys of its main
                    provisions in short, accessible monographs. Written in nontechnical language, the series
                    contributors have sought to make "the history of rights and liberties resonate with
                    developments in the nation' social, cultural, and political history" (p. vii). If
                        <hi rend="i">Fair Trial</hi> is any indication of the quality of the series, it will soon become
                    essential for any course on the subject.</p>
            <p>David J. Bodenhamer' concise survey takes the reader from the colonial period to the
                    present, tracing the legal and jurisprudential conflicts between the government and the accused,
                    between order and liberty. The ancient concept of due process—the intellectual touchstone
                    throughout—was transformed first by the Constitution itself and then again by the Civil
                    War amendments. The federal system added a dimension of complexity unique to the American system;
                    courts were obliged not only to decide what rights were at stake in any given proceeding but also to
                    determine which level of government—federal or state—properly held
                    jurisdiction. These were and are highly technical legal issues, but Bodenhamer' pen renders
                    them comprehensible and, even more important, intellectually exciting. The central constitutional
                    issue in the area of the rights of the accused since the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment is
                    whether the amendment "incorporates" the Bill of Rights and thus makes it binding
                    on the states. Bodenhamer demonstrates how this issue intersected with the substantive grievances of
                    criminal defendants in the jurisprudence of justices from Oliver Wendell Holmes to William J.
                    Rehnquist.</p>
            <pb n="130" id="VAA4025-091-1-136"/>
            <p>Bodenhamer' mastery of the law and scholarly historical literature on issues both mundane
                    and monumental makes for a smooth narrative. His own view of his subject is that "what
                    emerges from the history of defendants’ rights is a heightened respect for the maxim that
                    American government is one of laws, not of people" (p. 9). The book' many examples
                    of the less-than-equal treatment of women and racial minorities before the courts might lead an
                    inquisitive undergraduate to question that thesis. This result would be a virtue rather than a
                    failing, however, for if this book prompts undergraduates to confront critically the contradictions
                    between law and justice, it will have set them well on their way to understanding how democracy and
                    criminal justice can co-exist, however uneasily.</p>

                    there is much more to it than that. Ronald L. Baker, professor of English at Indiana State, has used
                    the materials for his studies of folklife in Indiana. Historian George Rawick has drawn attention to
                    the collection' 140 interviews of former slaves and their descendants. I have run the

                    critical examination of Indiana sparked controversy when it appeared in 1947, and readers today will
                    note the dominance of white males in the study. Yet this book remains a compelling, at times
                    prescient, challenge to the self-congratulatory "Indiana idea" of a bucolic state
                    inhabited by confident, shrewd, and neighborly people. Martin worried that Indianans, like Americans
                    generally, were maintaining a "self-conscious rusticity" (p. 274) when modern
                    capitalism was obliterating the virtues they sought to preserve; his warning can now guide those who
                    are exploring Indiana' recent past. <hi rend="i">John M. Glen, Ball State University, <placeName>

                    matter ranging from the heroic to the mundane. Many of these oral histories reveal the special place
                    of women and children on the home front. Stephen G. McShane' introduction, published in

            <head>Indiana Archives A New Series</head>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> announces the establishment of a new series
                    highlighting the wealth of research materials now available at state, regional, and local archives
                    in Indiana. Archivists have been acquiring and opening for research not only manuscript collections
                    but such items as photographs, oral histories, videotapes, microfilmed newspapers, computerized
                    statistical files, laboratory data, maps, and architectural drawings. Meanwhile, recent historical
                    research has been looking at sources in new ways and exploring new ways of documenting the past. The
                    purpose of an Archives Section is to promote a greater awareness and use of these archival
                    collections, encourage primary research in archives throughout the state, and build productive
                    working relationships between archivists and patrons of all backgrounds.</p>
            <p>The Archives Section generally will discuss archives and their collections in relation to a subject
                    of current historical concern. Essays will examine the critical questions involved in that subject
                    and identify archival holdings that offer potential answers. Discussions of these collections in
                    turn will describe their size and scope, principal strengths and shortcomings, state of
                    organization, accessibility to scholars, and relation to other collections. The availability and
                    utility of finding aids and other services to researchers will be noted as well.</p>
            <p>By calling attention to new sources and to older collections that have been underexamined, or that
                    potentially have new uses; by learning more about archival acquisitions programs; and by suggesting
                    how a project might draw upon complementary holdings in several archives, this Archives Section
                    seeks to become an important tool in the research and writing of Indiana and midwestern history.</p>
            <p>The tentative goal is to run the first Archives Section in the September, 1995, issue of the IMH.
                    Readers are invited to send comments about this proposed section to the editors.</p>

                    hope that readers will help us by sending items for possible inclusion. We are especially interested
                    in listing publications that make some contribution to understanding Indiana' past but that
                    are not usually reviewed in the IMH. Generally, we will not list newspaper articles or accounts of
                    local historical society activities, but printed pamphlets as well as journal articles may be
                    listed. All such items for the March, 1996, issue must be received by November 1, 1995. Many people
                    have contributed to the present list, but major responsibility has rested with Leigh Darbee of the
                    Indiana Historical Society.</p>
