            <p>It is a pleasure to address this 27th Spring History Workshop of the Indiana Historical Society, and
                    I am flattered to have been asked to speak on my adventures as a novice in research in this historic
                    town and elsewhere more than forty years ago. My remarks constitute a sentimental journey into the
                    past, not a contribution to scholarship. If I resort to autobiography, my purpose is not to speak
                    about myself but, rather, first, to describe the facilities for research at New Harmony and
                    Indianapolis in 1935; second, to pay tribute to five persons—long dead—who
                    helped me in my initial scholarly effort; and, third, to tell a tale which, in retrospect, sounds
                    amusing but which, years ago, threatened the future of a young historian.</p>
            <p>My story begins in the autumn of 1934 when, aged twenty-two, I was beginning my second year of
                    graduate study at Harvard University. For my doctoral dissertation, Professor Arthur M. Schlesinger
                    suggested that Robert Dale Owen would be a fruitful topic for someone wishing to specialize in
                    social and intellectual history. At that time Schlesinger was evaluating for the <hi rend="i">American Historical Review</hi> the volumes of the <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">⋆</hi>This essay was read in a slightly different form in the
                            restored Opera House at New Harmony on May 21, 1977, as part of the 27th Spring History
                            Workshop sponsored by the Indiana Historical Society, the Indiana Historical Bureau, and the
                            Indiana State Library. It is based primarily on letters, diaries, and notes written and
                            received during the time covered by the paper, though memory had to be relied upon at a few
                            places. All documents are in the author's possession. The author is indebted to
                            Gayle Thornbrough, executive secretary of the Indiana Historical Society, and to Aline Cook,
                            librarian of the Workingmen's Institute, for supplying factual information while
                            the essay was being written, and to Helen Elliott for confirming recollections and
                            correcting misconceptions during a three hour conversation the afternoon before it was
                            delivered.</item>

                            Professor of American history, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. He is the author

                    believed, further work should be done. As a native New Yorker, whose education had been in the
                    Northeast and whose knowledge of the Hoosier state was confined to the route of the New York Central
                    and Pennsylvania railroads as they crossed northern Indiana en route to Chicago, I had never heard
                    of Owen. I am not sure that I had even heard of New Harmony. A quick perusal of secondary works
                    persuaded me that a biography of this second rank figure, with such diverse interests and
                    activities, would be an excellent introduction to the field.</p>
            <p>My first task was to make sure that no other dissertation on Owen was in progress. I checked the
                    latest issue of the list prepared annually for the American Historical Association by the Carnegie
                    Institution of Washington and found the topic open. I so reported to Professor Schlesinger, who then
                    encouraged me to apply for a Social Science Research Council Predoctoral Field Fellowship for the
                    academic year 1935–1936 to finance research in Indiana and elsewhere. No sooner had I
                    done so than another graduate student informed me that the issue for 1931 listed a Columbia student,
                    Maurice B. Cuba, as working on Owen. In consternation, I consulted Professor Schlesinger who
                    promised to investigate. He assumed that his coeditor of the <hi rend="i">History of American
                    Life</hi> series, Dixon Ryan Fox, had suggested the topic to Cuba. Fox had recently left Columbia to
                    become president of Union College [Schenectady, New York] and told Schlesinger to check at Columbia
                    with Evarts B. Greene and John A. Krout, both contributors to the <hi rend="i">History of American
                        Life.</hi> On February 21, 1935, Krout wrote for Greene and himself saying that his colleagues
                    had not heard anything lately about Cuba and assured Schlesinger that "the subject which
                    Mr. Cuba long ago preempted is certainly open."</p>
            <p>Meanwhile I had begun the task of locating unprinted materials. In 1934 there was no <hi rend="i">National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections</hi> or even the <hi rend="i">Guide to
                        Archives and Manuscripts in the United States</hi> edited by Philip M. Hamer. The WPA
                    inventories of state records had not yet begun. Hence I wrote first to the Library of the
                    Workingmen's Institute and received from Mrs. Nora C. Fretageot a very helpful reply dated
                    December 11, 1934. She enclosed a list of manuscripts in the Institute library that had been
                    compiled the previous summer by Elinor Pancoast, a former student of Paul H. Douglas who was then on
                    the faculty of the University of Chicago. In her letter Mrs. Fretageot warned me against using a
                    picture of Owen recently published by Professor Norman E. Himes of <pb n="[3]" id="VAA4025-074-1-007"/>
                    <figure>

                    <pb n="4" id="VAA4025-074-1-008"/> Colgate, a Harvard trained sociologist, in an article dealing
                    with Owen and birth control. When Mrs. Fretageot protested to Himes, saying that the picture did not
                    resemble Owen in any way, Himes is alleged to have replied that Harvard had identified the picture
                    as one of Owen and that "Harvard cannot make a mistake." In fairness to Himes, who
                    died in 1949 and wrote a flattering review of my book, I never heard his side of the story, and in
                    an essay published in 1935, he printed the same picture of Owen that Mrs. Fretageot later sent to me
                    to present to the Harvard Library. But the episode did make me wonder how a Harvard graduate student
                    would be received at the Workingmen's Institute.</p>
            <p>At Mrs. Fretageot's suggestion, I wrote to Miss Pancoast at the Department of Economics and
                    Sociology of Goucher College [Baltimore, Maryland]. I had not been able to discover anything about
                    her research interests or publications. Only much later did I learn that she had been born in
                    Ottawa, Kansas, in 1893, making her twenty-one years my senior. She had received her
                    bachelor's degree at the University of Chicago in 1917, her master's in 1922, and
                    her doctorate in 1927. Her dissertation, which remained unpublished, dealt with the International
                    Photo-Engravers Union. She had originally started to do a biography of Frances Wright, but the
                    appearance in 1924 of William R. Waterman's dissertation on Miss Wright forced her to
                    change. A concern for Frances Wright led logically to an interest in Robert Dale Owen as I soon
                    found out.</p>
            <p>Writing on February 8, 1935, as chairman of her department, Professor Pancoast said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I am glad to know that you are interested in Robert Dale Owen, although I should like to
                            suggest that you might possibly find another topic for your doctoral dissertation more
                            fruitful. It happens that I have been working on the life of Robert Dale Owen for
                            … about ten years … and had planned to have the material ready for
                            publication within the next year …. I am only awaiting a journey to England which
                            I hope to take within the next year to round out what I have been doing …. It
                            would seem to me … that this subject is too broad for a doctoral thesis;
                            moreover, although my material is not yet published, the mere fact that it probably will be
                            within the next year or two would mean, I should suppose, that the field was pretty well
                            preempted. If I can be of any assistance to you in case you should wish to limit your
                            subject to one phase of his life, I should be glad to give it.</p>

            <p>Needless to say, I descended upon Professor Schlesinger after reading the letter from Pancoast even
                    more quickly than I had after learning of the existence of Cuba. The man to whom I took my problem
                    had been born in Xenia, Ohio, in 1888. He did his undergraduate work at Ohio State University and

                    Iowa, he went to Harvard in 1924 where he remained until he retired in 1954. His prize winning <hi rend="i">Colonial Merchants and the American Revolution</hi> in 1918 won him instant fame. His
                        <hi rend="i">New Viewpoints in American History</hi> in 1922 and his two volume textbook with
                    Homer C. Hockett in 1925 influenced several generations of college and high school students. His
                    Rise <hi rend="i">of the City, 1878–1898</hi> in 1933 showed the need for a more serious
                    study of urban developments. Already a past chairman of the Social Science Research Council, he was
                    soon to become one of the youngest men to be president of the American Historical Association. An
                    unimposing and undemonstrative man, he was an optimist by nature and had an ability to provide his
                    students with sound advice without destroying their freedom to make their own decisions. He died in
                    1965.</p>
            <p>Schlesinger read the Pancoast letter calmly and said: "I think she is bluffing. Go ahead and
                    call her bluff." But, I expostulated, she will publish her biography before I can complete
                    a dissertation, thus endangering my degree, and certainly before I could convert a thesis into a
                    book. No, he said, if she has taken this long to finish, if she has not published even an article,
                    she is not likely to meet that schedule. Thus ended the conversation. If told to go ahead, ahead I
                    would go.</p>
            <p>In April, 1935, I learned that I had received the Social Science Research Council Field Fellowship.
                    By June I had completed examination of the printed sources in the Boston area and started for New
                    Harmony with a short stop in New York and even briefer exploratory visits to Philadelphia and
                    Washington. At the New York Historical Society I learned that someone, not identified, had recently
                    sought material on Owen. At the Smithsonian Institution the trail was even hotter; a person from New
                    York had been inquiring about sources on Owen. Perhaps Cuba had not stopped work after all. Rather
                    apprehensively I made my way by public transportation to New Harmony, as much of a feat in 1935 as
                    it is today. I took the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from Washington to Vincennes, a bus from
                    Vincennes to Evansville, and an Illinois Central local from Evansville to Stewartsville, never
                    knowing how I could complete the last lap. When I got off at Stewartsville in the late afternoon of
                    July 10, I found to my surprise an auto that would take me to the New Harmony Tavern on Church
                    Street, where an even greater surprise awaited me.</p>
            <p>At the tavern I was greeted by Cy Knight, the genial and friendly proprietor. He assigned me a room
                    and said that, since <pb n="7" id="VAA4025-074-1-011"/>

                    remark—that he was expecting me—but cheered by the second—that
                    dinner was available (I had not eaten since a skimpy breakfast in the B&amp;O
                    diner)—I was even more astonished when he said with a grin that a friend of mine had
                    already arrived. He then ushered me into the dining room and introduced me to a short, dark man with
                    a mustache—who turned out to be Maurice B. Cuba.</p>
            <p>I need hardly add that the smile of my host was not shared by either novice in research. The small
                    town of New Harmony was much too small to contain both of us. Happily, Cuba left the next day,
                    having spent just forty-eight hours here. He was able to finish quickly because he had someone to
                    microfilm pertinent manuscripts and rare books. He was the first person I had known to employ a
                    microfilm camera, a medium then in its formative stage. But that first evening I learned that he was
                    married and had two children, that he had graduated from the City College of New York in 1922
                    (making him at least eleven years my senior), that he had received a master's degree from
                    Columbia in 1923 and a law degree from New York University <pb n="8" id="VAA4025-074-1-012"/> in
                    1928, and that he taught in a New York high school. Cuba told me that after Fox had left Columbia,
                    Allan Nevins agreed to direct the dissertation, that he had completed all his research in
                    Indianapolis and Washington, and that he regarded the appearance of his name in the 1931 list of
                    dissertations in progress as reserving the subject for five years and thus obviating the necessity
                    of placing his name in succeeding issues.</p>
            <p>I reported this encounter to Professor Schlesinger at once. In his reply of July 16—the
                    mails were faster in those days—he expressed surprise and dismay that Cuba was still on
                    the job but encouraged me to continue. "Even if a book appears on the subject before your
                    degree is granted," he wrote, "the likelihood is that your own performance will be
                    sufficiently different and that we will not hesitate to give you the degree." That was some
                    consolation, but not much. Who would publish a second book on Owen? Two weeks later I heard from
                    Schlesinger again. Cuba had written him from New York on July 24, describing his past research and
                    concluding: "I shall very soon be in a position to begin actual writing. In view of the
                    foregoing, would it be fair to me to have Mr. Leopold continue on the same subject; especially since
                    there is probably no need of two biographies of Owen." What Cuba knew about Professor
                    Pan-coast, he did not say.</p>
            <p>Schlesinger answered Cuba on July 30. He summarized the precautions taken in checking the
                    dissertation list and quoted Krout's statement five months earlier that the topic was
                    "certainly open." He sought to soothe Cuba by saying: "You seem to have a
                    practical advantage inasmuch as you state that you will soon begin actual writing. Mr. Leopold has
                    several months of field research in America and, of course, will want to prosecute his researches
                    also in England, which you no doubt have already done." Actually, Cuba's letter
                    had said nothing about having been or going to England. In sending me this exchange, Schlesinger
                    wrote: "The allusion to carrying on research in England will, I hope, give him pause since
                    Columbia requires publication at the time of receiving the degree." Harvard did not. The
                    fact, Schlesinger continued, that "Cuba is so frightened leads me to think that he has done
                    little work on the thesis and fears that you will complete your job ahead of him." Here was
                    the same reasoning he had used with Miss Pancoast. He then concluded: "It is too bad that
                    three different people should suddenly develop a passion for finding out about Robert Dale
                    Owen." How much work Cuba had really done, I never discovered. As for myself, I could not
                    possibly contemplate <pb n="9" id="VAA4025-074-1-013"/> changing my topic after having received a
                    field fellowship to work on Owen and after having reached New Harmony with about seven months of
                    research behind me.</p>
            <p>For the next eight weeks I virtually lived in the Library of the Workingmen's Institute.
                    From Mrs. Fretageot, the librarian, and Miss Louise M. Husband, her assistant, I received constant
                    help and soaked up New Harmony lore. Both were natives. Mrs. Fretageot, born a Chadwick in 1858, was
                    the second wife of Achilles H. Fretageot, a grandson of a member of the Boatload of Knowledge.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> She became librarian in 1908 and remained in that post until her death in
                    1937. Miss Husband, nineteen years her junior, served from 1910 to 1944, the last seven years as
                    Mrs. Fretageot's successor. The two ladies made a wonderful team. Mrs. Fretageot was short,
                    serious, quick of mind, and always in motion. Although she had properly insisted that Harvard could
                    make a mistake, no one could have been kinder to me, both while I was in the library and after I had
                    left. Miss Louise was more ample of frame, relaxed, and optimistic, with a cheery greeting for
                    everyone on the street or in the library. What I remember most was their tolerance of a young
                    outsider who, like all novices in research, was eager to challenge some of the myths that had become
                    part of New Harmony lore and some of the exaggerated claims to uniqueness that had been advanced by
                    earlier writers.</p>
            <p>The research was exciting. Digging in the manuscripts was something of a treasure hunt. The material,
                    frankly, was badly organized. I was too early to benefit from the descriptions published later by
                    Roger Hurst, Arthur E. Bestor, and Josephine M. Elliott.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> There was no locked,
                    fireproof room. Ledgers and folders were scattered on shelves in no logical order. Miss
                    Pan-coast's list proved to be incomplete. The high moment each day came when I would
                    stumble upon documents and bear them as a prize to Mrs. Fretageot who would frankly admit that she
                    had not seen them for years and had almost forgotten they existed. <list type="footnotes">

                    paid the supreme compliment. I was given a key to the front door so that I could arrive at dawn and
                    work alone for a couple of hours, leave for breakfast, and return when the library officially
                    opened. I never knew whether this act of kindness meant that Mrs. Fretageot had come to trust a
                    Harvard trained man or whether it was to salve her conscience, which was very strong, for not coming
                    before her regular hour to open the library for my use.</p>
            <p>Lacking a car, I did not leave New Harmony once during those eight weeks that were marked by extreme
                    heat and by the absence of two aids to research deemed essential today—the air
                    conditioner and the Xerox machine. But life was not unpleasant, and the cost of living was perfect
                    for an indigent graduate student. I ate at the tavern for the entire period, <figure>

                    was not that of the Red Geranium or Shadblow's,<hi rend="sup">3</hi> and fried chicken for
                    lunch and dinner almost every day became tedious. For the first month I also lived at the tavern,
                    paying $5.00 a week. Thus for $11.00—less than half the cost of a
                    night's lodging at the New Harmony Inn today—I had room and board for an entire
                    week. In August, when the rodeo came to town, I beat a strategic retreat to a private house on
                    Granary Street, where I paid the princely sum of $2.75 a week for a quiet, private room.
                    I found the residents of the town uniformly friendly. I recall especially a wide eyed lad of about
                    twelve by the name of Bob Johnson, who came to the library every Saturday evening; and when he saw
                    me examining a large bound volume of the New Harmony <hi rend="i">Advertiser or Register</hi>, he
                    always asked: "Can't you find a bigger book?"</p>
            <p>During those eight weeks, I encountered only one obstacle and one danger. The obstacle was my
                    inability to gain access to private papers in family hands. Although I was allowed to read some, I
                    had to warn in my book that I had not seen all of the papers of Owen's younger brothers,
                    David Dale and Richard. The danger was getting caught in the rivalry that existed among descendants
                    of the original settlers. Each had her own version of the past; each gave primacy to her forbears. I
                    think I was able to tread warily in my pleasant talks with Mrs. Aline Owen Neal, granddaughter of
                    Richard Owen and then residing in the Laboratory,<hi rend="sup">4</hi> with Miss Eleanor R. Cooper,
                    stepdaughter of Owen's older son by his third marriage, and with Miss Mary E. Fauntleroy,
                    who was related to the husband of Owen's sister, Jane. Miss Fauntleroy later was a prime
                    mover in gaining permission to return to Maple Hill in 1937 the remains of Robert Dale Owen from the
                    original burial site at Lake George, New York. In a letter to me in January, 1938, she did not
                    understate her role in the affair and also vented her anger on Cuba who, apparently, had not called
                    on her while in town but later sent frequent written requests.</p>
            <p>I left New Harmony on September 3, more at ease than when I had arrived. I did not believe I could
                    complete my dissertation before Miss Pancoast and, perhaps, Cuba published, <list type="footnotes">

               </figure> but I knew I had examined sources they had not—mostly newspapers which alone
                    could reveal Owen's preoccupation with state and national politics in the years from 1836
                    to 1853. Hence, before proceeding to Indianapolis, I went to Evansville, driven by Mrs.
                    Fretageot's granddaughter, Mary, later Mrs. Joseph Hodge, who died in June, 1976. There I
                    spent five days in the Willard Library reading a broken file of the Evansville <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, a Whig paper violently hostile to Owen, and a sixth in Mount Vernon examining records
                    in the Posey County Courthouse. I then took a bus north to Princeton, the seat of Gibson County,
                    where for five days I perused the <hi rend="i">Democratic Clarion</hi>, a staunch Owen supporter
                    between 1846 and 1853. Five nights at the best hotel cost me $7.00. I suspect that I may
                    have been the first out of state scholar to spend that <pb n="14" id="VAA4025-074-1-018"/> much time
                    in the Princeton Public Library where I was courteously assisted by Miss Sadie L. Archer.</p>
            <p>I arrived in Indianapolis on September 16, 1935, and remained for ten fruitful weeks. I lived at 127
                    East Michigan Street, within easy walking distance of the Indiana State Library to the south and
                    Indianapolis Public Library to the north. I was able to make $6.00 a week cover room and
                    laundry and $1.00 take care of three meals a day. Working conditions were ideal. The
                    building housing the state archives and the Indiana Historical Society had opened only two years
                    earlier; the collections were logically arranged and well cataloged. On evenings and holidays, when
                    the building was closed, I went to the public library which had complete files of the Indianapolis
                    newspapers of the period. I left the capital only once—a bus ride to Crawfordsville in a
                    vain search for the papers of Lew Wallace.</p>
            <p>Again, two individuals provided extraordinary help to a novice in research. One was Miss Esther U.
                    McNitt, chief of the Indiana Division of the state library. A native of Logansport, she graduated
                    from Vassar in 1309, took a master's degree in history at the University of Wisconsin,
                    studied library science in Albany, New York, and began work in the state library in 1913. She became
                    chief of the Indiana Division ten years later and held that post until her death in 1941. A
                    knowledgeable, efficient, and gracious lady, she revealed the full warmth of her personality only to
                    those who had gained her trust. Her frequent letters to me over a six year period combined business
                    with a solicitude for my career. Miss McNitt was more of a professional than Mrs. Fretageot or Miss
                    Husband. In 1928, when the American Historical Association met in Indianapolis, she arranged the
                    joint session with the Mississippi Valley Historical Association; from 1929 to 1932 she sat on the
                    Executive Committee of that organization. My debt to her can never be repaid. She scoured the state
                    for manuscripts and located a small but useful collection of the papers of Elisha Embree, a devout
                    Methodist judge who ended Owen's congressional tenure in 1847. These papers were then owned
                    by a great-granddaughter, Louise, an author of children's books, whose letters to me showed
                    a less than reverential attitude toward her pious ancestors. Miss McNitt continued to help after I
                    left Indianapolis, strove to find a publisher, cheered when the book was favorably reviewed, and
                    took umbrage at any comment that was in the least critical.</p>
            <p>The second person was Christopher B. Coleman, for twenty years after 1924 secretary of the Indiana
                    Historical Society and <pb n="15" id="VAA4025-074-1-019"/> director of the Indiana Historical
                    Bureau. From 1936 to 1942 he was also director of the state library. Born in Springfield, Illinois,
                    in 1875, he earned a bachelor's degree from Yale in 1896, a divinity degree from the
                    University of Chicago in 1899, and a doctorate in history from Columbia in 1914. He taught at Butler
                    University from 1900 to 1919, serving also as vice president, and was departmental chairman at
                    Allegheny College [Meadville, Pennsylvania] from 1920 until his return to Indianapolis. An
                    unassuming, considerate, and widely read man, with a nice sense of humor, he too was a professional.
                    One of the first members of the Mississippi Valley Historical Association, he served on the Council
                    of the American Historical Association, became vice president of the American Association for State
                    and Local History, and was cited as the most useful member of the editorial board of the <hi rend="i">American Archivist</hi> during its first seven years. He, too, gave me sound advice on
                    research and publication. Others in Indianapolis who went beyond the <figure>

            <p>In Indianapolis I learned more about my competitors. Miss Pancoast, I was told, had not done a
                    thorough job and had relied on her sister to do some of the work. Cuba had made a good impression
                    and had arranged to have new accessions filmed and sent to him. He had not, however, responded to
                    Schlesinger's July letter, while Professor Nevins, in writing to Schlesinger, never
                    mentioned Cuba. While in the capital, I heard rumors that two older persons were collecting Owen
                    material, perhaps for publication or perhaps for sale. Actually, the deeper I dug, the less I
                    worried. I realized that the New Harmony community was only one of many episodes in Owen's
                    life and that the best records for his later career would be found in newspapers, state and
                    national, and in personal papers located outside of Indiana. Neither Pancoast nor Cuba had read the
                    Evansville and Princeton press, and their stays in Indianapolis were too brief to exhaust the rich
                    newspaper collections. Newspapers do not lend themselves to the hurried use of microfilm. Finally,
                    save for a brief time early in the Civil War, Owen ceased to be a major Indiana figure after 1853,
                    and the last twenty-four years of his life had to be told from non-Hoosier sources.</p>
            <p>Although the title of this address speaks only of New Harmony and Indianapolis in 1935, I shall
                    encapsulate my experiences during the five years after I bade an affectionate farewell to
                    Indianapolis on November 27, 1935. I went next to Chicago to read in the Newberry Library the best
                    file of one of the nation's two leading spiritualist weeklies [<hi rend="i">Religio-Philosophical Journal</hi>]. I continued to Madison, Wisconsin, to examine the only
                    known run of the New York <hi rend="i">Daily Sentinel</hi> which Owen had edited anonymously for
                    over a year after February, 1830. There was no evidence that my rivals had been to either place. On
                    December 30, 1935, I began a fourteen week stint in Washington, exploiting the Library of
                    Congress' unrivalled collections of manuscripts, pamphlets, periodicals, and newspapers. I
                    lived at 625 Maryland Avenue, N.E., within walking distance, paying $5.00 a week for a
                    room until a friend vacated a smaller cubicle which rented for $3.00. It was still
                    possible to keep the cost of three meals under $1.00 a day. I did not use the newly <list type="footnotes">

                    dispatches as minister in Naples were still in the old State, War, and Navy Building on Pennsylvania
                    Avenue and Seventeenth.</p>
            <p>My only adventure in Washington that might interest this group was my use of letters and documents in
                    the possession of Mrs. Grace Zaring Stone, Owen's great-granddaughter, who had won fame in
                    1930 for her novel <hi rend="i">The Bitter Tea of General Yen.</hi> Married to a naval officer and
                    living in Georgetown, Mrs. Stone had first refused to permit me to examine the papers, saying they
                    had become the bane of her existence because so many people wished to see them. Eventually she
                    relented but did not go out of her way to ease my task when I went to her home. I read the
                    manuscripts in an upstairs bedroom, not daring to take time for lunch and barely summoning courage
                    to request the facilities of the bathroom. I did not learn whether my rivals had preceded me, though
                    I guessed they had. Mrs. Stone put no restrictions on my use of the papers; for that I was most
                    grateful. Although I later sent her a copy of the book, I never saw or heard from her again.</p>
            <p>Early in April, 1936, I left Washington for Cambridge with stops for research in Philadelphia, New
                    York, and New Haven. I expected to use the late spring, summer, and next academic year to write in
                    Widener Library on the Harvard campus. To my initial dismay I was awarded by Harvard a traveling
                    fellowship and told to spend the next year or part of it abroad, examining the Robert Owen Papers in
                    England and such other materials as I could find. I was reluctant to go, for I knew that two weeks
                    were sufficient to deal with the father's papers in Manchester, and I feared that it would
                    be difficult to find a teaching job for 1937–1938 if I were in Europe. No one bothered to
                    tell me that the Department of History had already decided to appoint me an instructor at Harvard
                    for that year.</p>
            <p>So in September, 1936, with six chapters carrying Owen to 1833 written, I settled in London near the
                    British Museum. It was an exciting autumn because of the abdication crisis, but I was more concerned
                    with Elinor Pancoast and Maurice B. Cuba than I was with Wallis Warfield Simpson and Edward VIII.
                    Two experiences abroad deserve mention. One was a visit to Worthing on November 25 to see
                    Owen's ninety year old daughter, Rosamond. It was a futile errand. There were no
                    manuscripts; her mind was gone; she remembered nothing. She died the following June. The other was a
                    journey to Glasgow, where Owen was born; to Braxfield, where he grew to manhood; and to Newtown in
                    Wales, where his father was born and <pb n="18" id="VAA4025-074-1-022"/> buried. Save for checking
                    dates on tombstones in the Newtown cemetery, I gained only a feel for locale. The real find was the
                    Robert Owen Papers in Manchester, which none of my rivals had yet seen.</p>
            <p>Late in October, 1936, I received from Professor Schlesinger an unopened letter which, he thought,
                    was from Cuba. "Whatever may be in it," he wrote, "don't let him
                    get your goat." The letter was not from Cuba but from a Fordham University graduate
                    student, Leo P. Brophy, who asked what I thought of his doing a dissertation on Robert Dale Owen. My
                    reply, I told Schlesinger, "made me feel very much like Miss Pancoast must have felt two
                    years ago." I added: "Pancoast, Cuba, a couple of people in Indiana, Brophy and
                    myself now make a half dozen panting to become Owen's biographer. Would not …
                    William Maclure and other second rank figures contemporary with Owen be jealous?"</p>
            <p>Meanwhile my friends in Indianapolis had not forgotten me. A survey of federal records outside of
                    Washington, sponsored by the WPA and the National Archives, had unearthed in a United States
                    courthouse in Chicago some six thousand documents from the files of Indiana governors. In March,
                    1937, H. Reid Nation, assistant chief of archives in the state library, wrote me of the find and in
                    the next four months provided copies of Owen material relating to his Civil War work for Oliver P.
                    Morton. I was never able to thank Mr. Nation in person, but our correspondence was sufficient four
                    years later to persuade a dealer that some Owen letters he was then offering for sale to the Indiana
                    Historical Soceity were stolen goods. I had used them in 1937 before an employee in the state
                    library had absconded with them.</p>
            <p>In April, 1937, I returned to the United States, having written seventeen chapters and bringing with
                    me the original of the Donald Macdonald diary describing his trip to New Harmony in 1826 and which
                    the Indiana Historical Society planned to publish. Settling in Cambridge, I completed in the next
                    ten weeks a dissertation of 944 pages, 924 of which were the text. In September I cleared the last
                    hurdle, although the doctorate was not officially awarded until February, 1938. During those months
                    I heard that Professor Pancoast had again been to Indianapolis and New Harmony, but Cuba remained
                    shrouded in silence.</p>
            <p>Thanks to recommendations from Dr. Coleman and Miss McNitt, I was invited to read a paper at the
                    Indianapolis meeting of the Mississippi Valley Historical Association in April, 1938. Entitled
                    "Was Robert Dale Owen a Reformer?" it argued <pb n="19" id="VAA4025-074-1-023"/>
                    that he had three careers, not one. Responding to changing environment, he was, first, a radical
                    reformer, intent on eliminating injustice and irrationality in the world; second, an able
                    politician, eager to promote the interests of an expanding, self assertive West; and, third, a
                    cosmopolitan intellectual, dabbling as a free lance in the problems of the Civil War, relying upon
                    his pen for a livelihood, but concerned primarily with the propagation of spiritualism. While in
                    Indianapolis, I talked with people at Bobbs-Merrill, the local publisher. Understandably that firm,
                    as well as two others in the East, were not willing to gamble on a five hundred page biography of a
                    minor figure by an untested historian, though Dr. Coleman and Miss McNitt did everything they could
                    to help. Not until January, 1940, did the Harvard University Press agree to publish the shortened
                    and revised dissertation in its <hi rend="i">Historical Studies</hi> series.</p>
            <p>Despite a kind invitation from Professor William O. Lynch, editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Magazine of History</hi>, I never put in print the paper I read in April, 1938. Indeed, I may be
                    the only scholar who never published an article based on a dissertation before or after it appeared
                    as a book. Since my interpretation of Owen's career was not the accepted one, I did not
                    wish to tip my hand to my rivals. That feeling explained my response in the summer of 1938 when the
                    Harvard Library received a request from a Miss Anne E. Lincoln to read my dissertation. Harvard then
                    had a rule that unpublished theses could not be seen for five years after submission without the
                    permission of the author. That rule spared a young scholar the need to rush into print
                    prematurely—as often happened at universities that required publication on granting the
                    degree—and also protected him from having his findings expropriated by either mature
                    scholars or doctoral candidates.</p>
            <p>Under the circumstances, I refused permission. I offered to talk with Miss Lincoln and did so. She
                    said she was a free lance writer more interested in spiritualism than in Owen. I urged her to pursue
                    the subject, on which no reliable book existed, and discussed sources I had found helpful. I did not
                    divulge my conclusions on Owen's part in the movement. A slight, sad looking lady in her
                    thirties, Miss Lincoln did not impress me with her knowledge or with the strength to complete the
                    arduous research needed to write an authoritative history of spiritualism.</p>
            <p>Late in April, 1940, the task of converting my manuscript into galley proofs began. On May 13, as the
                    Nazi war machine overran the Low Countries, I suffered a setback of my own. I <pb n="20" id="VAA4025-074-1-024"/> received an announcement from the Principia Press of Bloomington
                    [Indiana] of a forthcoming book entitled <hi rend="i">The Incorrigible Idealist: Robert Dale Owen in
                        America.</hi> There were two authors—Elinor Pancoast and Anne E. Lincoln. While the
                    world agonized over the fall of France, I waited feverishly, while reading proof, to see what my
                    rivals had wrought. Since an appraisal by me would be in poor taste, I shall say simply that I was
                    relieved to discover in July that the volume had only 109 pages of text, lacked an index, and tried
                    to fit Owen's varied career into a single mold. My spirits were bolstered by the ever
                    faithful Miss McNitt who wrote on August 27: "Miss Pancoast's volume has arrived,
                    but I think I shall wait and read yours first." She had only two months to wait. On October
                    25, 1940, the Harvard University Press issued <hi rend="i">Robert Dale Owen: A Biography</hi>,
                    totalling 470 pages, of which 416 were text. Again, it would be in poor taste for me to describe its
                    reception; I leave that task to someone else.</p>
            <p>Thus ended the adventures of a novice in research. Thus ended, too, my work in Indiana history and,
                    soon thereafter, my contacts with cherished Hoosier friends. As early as May, 1938, an unexpected
                    opportunity to teach my own lecture course and graduate seminar at Harvard on American foreign
                    policy led me to shift my research from social history to diplomatic. Death also played a part. In
                    January, 1937, while I was still in London, Mrs. Fretageot died of a heart attack. Although in
                    declining health at seventy-eight, she remained active to the end. Only ten days earlier she had
                    answered a long list of questions I had sent her, and she spent her last night editing a manuscript
                    for the Federal Writers' Project. In October, 1941, I was shocked to learn of the death of
                    Miss McNitt. Her frequent letters had given no hint the end was near. Rather she kept me informed of
                    developments at the state library and the historical society and applauded every favorable review of
                    my book. Her last letter of July 17, 1941, which I delayed too long to answer, was full of details
                    about the stolen documents and of references to my meeting with her brother in June when her nephew,
                    whom I had known well, graduated from Harvard.</p>
            <p>In October, 1942, I left Cambridge for the duration of the war, most of which was spent as a naval
                    officer in Washington teaching myself to be an archivist and devising a system for annotating and
                    filing the operational records of the Pacific war. Correspondence with old friends unfortunately
                    lapsed. Thus I missed word of Miss Husband's death in January, 1944. She had suffered a
                    partial paralysis in 1942 but returned to work in the library until she broke her hip in November,
                    1943. <pb n="21" id="VAA4025-074-1-025"/> I also missed word of Dr. Coleman's fatal heart
                    attack in June, 1944, on his forty-third wedding anniversary. His last letter to me, in August,
                    1942, was characteristically kind—an acknowledgment of my small part in making possible
                    the publication of the Macdonald diary. The final paragraph of my last letter to him in my file,
                    dated March 10, 1941, reads: "Both you and Miss McNitt have been more than kind concerning
                    my book and I am very grateful. In fact I am quite sure that I shall never have more fun and more
                    cooperation in working on any future project than I had in doing research on Owen." That
                    statement has proved to be true to this day.</p>
            <p>For the next thirty-five years I had almost no contacts with New Harmony or Indianapolis. In
                    1967–1968 I exchanged letters with Kenneth Dale Owen and Caroline Dale-Owen S. Baldwin
                    about the reprint edition of my biography. In 1970 Professor Donald E. Pitzer invited me to
                    participate the next year in the Robert Owen Bicentennial Conference, but since I had not kept up
                    with recent writings in the field, I declined. During those decades I occasionally wondered about my
                    rivals. A recent check showed that Leo Brophy submitted in 1940 a dissertation entitled
                    "Horace Greeley: Whig or Socialist?" He later became historian of the Army
                    Chemical Corps and in 1965 joined the history faculty at Biscayne College in Florida. Elinor
                    Pancoast retired more than a decade ago from her professorship at Goucher College and now resides in
                    Denton, Texas. Maurice B. Cuba remains elusive, though he seems to have been alive in 1972. Every so
                    often, more out of curiosity than concern, I check the latest volume of the <hi rend="i">National
                        Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections</hi> to see whether any new Owen material has surfaced.
                    Last winter, in paging through the volume for 1972, I found the following entry: "Research
                    Papers on Robert Dale Owen, in Columbia University Libraries: about 1,500 items, in part photocopies
                    from libraries in Indiana, of correspondence, outlines, and drafts for … projected study
                    of Robert Dale Owen …. Gift of Maurice B. Cuba, 1972."</p>
            <p>In closing, I fear I may sound like the narrator on Thursday evenings at the end of "The
                    Waltons," as he looks back on the trials and tribulations, the successes and pleasures of
                    those distant days during the Depression when the young learned to cope with life. So, too, for that
                    novice in research, the distant year 1935 recalls the sacrifices and fears, the satisfactions and
                    friendships as he sought to master the craft of scholarship. Most of all, he remembers those who
                    helped him learn. For as Miss Husband wrote on November 3, 1940, regarding the labor that had gone
                    into the book: "I know you are happy and feel it <pb n="22" id="VAA4025-074-1-026"/> was
                    more than worth while, out of it has come travel and lasting friendships you might not otherwise
                    have had." How right she was. It is fitting, therefore, in this historic edifice and before
                    this knowledgeable audience to conclude with a final tribute to the sagacious and unflappable Arthur
                    Schlesinger, to the kind and energetic Nora Fretageot, to the cheerful and warm hearted Louise
                    Husband, to the loyal and selfless Esther McNitt, and to the wise and modest Christopher Coleman.

            <p>January, 1792, was not a good month for Secretary of War Henry Knox. At his desk in the War
                    Department in Philadelphia, the former Revolutionary War hero pondered a multitude of problems
                    besetting the new American republic. At sea, American commerce was victimized by the Barbary
                    pirates, while closer to home, the British still occupied posts on the western frontier. Moreover,
                    the Indian tribes in the Old Northwest remained hostile and refused to relinquish their claims to
                    lands north of the Ohio. Although American officials had attempted to purchase the lands from small
                    delegations of tribesmen, other Indians denounced the transactions and channeled their opposition
                    into raids against American commerce on the Ohio. Knox had authorized American military forces to
                    retaliate, but in October, 1790, the tribesmen had defeated an expedition commanded by General
                    Josiah Harmar, and one year later, during November, 1791, they had gained an overwhelming victory
                    over a larger expedition led by Arthur St. Clair, governor of the Northwest Territory. St.
                    Glair's defeat had been especially humiliating, for in the rout of his troops the Indians
                    had killed over six hundred Americans, including many members of the regular army. During December,
                    1791, Knox had defended his efforts in a communique to President George Washington, and one month
                    later he had issued another statement vindicating the government's actions. For all
                    practical purposes, however, by January, 1792, American Indian policy was in shambles.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>Knox was faced with the dilemma of choosing between launching another campaign with the remnants of
                    the western army or attempting to negotiate a peaceful settlement with the recently victorious
                    tribesmen. Neither alternative offered much hope of success. After St. Glair's loss to the
                    tribesmen, the American troops in Ohio were demoralized. To send such soldiers on another expedition
                    against the Indians was to invite one more defeat for the United States. But negotiations also
                    seemed fraught with disaster. Since the Indians had beaten two American armies soundly, there
                    appeared to be little chance that they would soften their opposition to white occupation of lands in
                    Ohio.</p>
            <p>Knox eventually decided that negotiation was the lesser of two evils. In the past the Indians had
                    refused to accept American claims to lands in eastern Ohio, but the secretary of war considered the
                    tribesmen to be unpredictable and hoped that they might change their minds. He believed that the
                    Indians had been "misled" about American land claims. If they could be brought
                    into extensive negotiations with American commissioners, Knox hoped that they could be bribed or
                    persuaded to accept the American position. Such negotiations would be relatively inexpensive, and
                    even if the talks did not succeed, at least the hostile Indians' attention temporarily
                    would be turned away from attacking the frontier.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the spring of 1792 Knox took measures to implement his decision. He instructed American
                    military commanders in the West to send speeches to the Indians urging them to make peace with the
                    government. The secretary of war also dispatched a series of messengers to the tribes in the hope
                    that such personal envoys might persuade the hostile tribesmen to at least meet with government
                    officials. In January, William Steedman and Peter Pond were ordered to travel to Detroit to convince
                    the western tribesmen of the government's good intentions. In March, Knox met with visiting
                    Iroquois leaders who also agreed to visit the hostile Indians, and one month later Captain Alexander
                    Trueman was instructed to journey to the Indian villages along the Maumee to persuade the Miamis

            <p>In addition to his efforts at negotiation, Knox also made plans to rebuild American military forces.
                    On April 12, 1792, he appointed Anthony Wayne as "Major General and of course commanding
                    Officer of the troops in the service of the United States," and during the next two months
                    he expended considerable effort in providing Wayne with adequate men and supplies for the nucleus of
                    a new western army. If the proposed negotiations failed, at least the United States would have the
                    military power needed to defend its claims to land north of the Ohio.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Knox's decision to strengthen American military power was a wise choice, for his efforts at
                    negotiation proved fruitless. Steedman and Pond, the first American emissaries, were intercepted by
                    the British at Lake Erie and prevented from going to Detroit. The Iroquois leaders, whom Knox had
                    entertained so lavishly in Philadelphia, made no attempt to contact the hostile tribesmen until the
                    following fall when the western Indians informed them that they now demanded that the United States
                    give up all claims to lands in eastern Ohio. Both Aupaumut and Brant received similar replies, but
                    the other American messengers, Trueman and Hardin, suffered a worse fate. Both were captured by the
                    Wyandots, who ignored their peaceful mission, tomahawked the prisoners, and threw their bodies into
                    the Maumee River.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>Unaware that his emissaries had failed, Knox continued his efforts at negotiation during early 1792.
                    The secretary of war knew that the hostiles planned to hold a great council on the Maumee River
                    during September, and he was anxious that American representatives be in attendance. Accordingly, in
                    May, 1792, he instructed Brigadier General Rufus Putnam to meet with the Indians again to present
                    the American position to the tribesmen. Putnam was ordered to assure the Indians that the United
                    States claimed no lands other than those already ceded by the tribes. He was also ordered to assert
                    that the government was still negotiating only because the United States desired peace, not because
                    the tribesmen had defeated Harmar and St. Clair. To aid Putnam in the proceedings Knox appointed
                    John Heckewelder, a Moravian missionary, as his assistant.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the early summer Putnam and Heckewelder journeyed down the Ohio toward Fort Washington at the
                    mouth of the Miami River. En route, Putnam sent a message to the Indians along the Maumee, informing
                    them that he would travel to Fort Jefferson, near modern Greenville, Ohio, to discuss preliminary
                    arrangements for the negotiations. But as Putnam and Heckewelder proceeded west, their ardor to meet
                    with the hostiles diminished. On July 2, when the two officials arrived in Cincinnati, General James
                    Wilkinson informed them that a large war party had recently attacked Fort Jefferson, inflicting
                    sixteen casualties upon the garrison. On the following day they learned of the death of Trueman and
                    Hardin. The frightened Putnam immediately concluded that the attack upon Fort Jefferson had been
                    aimed at him, and he cancelled all efforts to meet with the warriors of northern Ohio.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite their decision to avoid confrontation with the hostile tribes, both Putnam and Heckewelder
                    were unwilling to admit that their mission was a failure. Anxious to salvage some sort of
                    negotiations from their trip to Ohio, the commissioners surveyed other tribes, hoping to find
                    Indians more amenable to American diplomacy. Finally, their attention fixed upon the Indians of the
                    lower Wabash Valley. During March, <list type="footnotes">

                    made a preliminary peace with government officials, and Major John Hamtramck, the American commander
                    at Vincennes, had spent the next two months attempting to extend the agreement to the Piankashaws,
                    Illinois Confederacy, and part of the Potawatomis. These western tribesmen were isolated from the
                    hostiles and already were pro-American. Moreover, many of the Potawatomis and Indians in the
                    Illinois Confederacy were under the influence of French Creoles from Illinois who consistently
                    opposed the efforts of the pro-British Indians along the Maumee. Although these tribesmen were
                    already friendly to the United States, they offered the only opportunity for negotiation, and Putnam
                    rationalized that if a formal peace treaty could be signed with the Wabash tribes, some of the more
                    hostile Indians might follow their example. He also believed that after the treaty had been
                    concluded, the Wabash and Illinois chiefs could be lured to Philadelphia where their lands could be
                    purchased from them.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>Other western officials, including Wilkinson and Secretary of the Northwest Territory Winthrop

                    to meet with the Wabash tribes. By mid-August when Putnam received Knox's approval,
                    preparations for the treaty were well under way.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> At Vincennes, Hamtramck sent

                    military escort to assist in transporting the merchandise from Cincinnati to Vincennes. Putnam also
                    obtained the release of several Wea and Piankashaw prisoners who had been confined at Fort
                    Washington. He wished to return them to their relatives at Vincennes in the hope that such a gesture
                    of good will would establish a favorable atmosphere for the conference.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>On August 18 Putnam and Heckewelder left Cincinnati for the Wabash. The journey down the Ohio River
                    was uneventful until the party reached the falls near Louisville. While passing through the rapids,
                    one of the boats carrying the Indian prisoners capsized, forcing the Indians to take refuge on the
                    Kentucky shore. The bedraggled tribesmen soon attracted a mob of Kentuckians who threatened the
                    Indians' lives. Heckewelder interceded, protected the tribesmen, and transported them
                    across the river to Fort Steuben on the north bank of the Ohio about three quarters of a mile above
                    the rapids. The party then proceeded downstream to the mouth of the Wabash where they boarded
                    pirogues for the voyage to Vincennes. They reached their destination on September 12, 1792.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Putnam and Heckewelder arrived at the village on the Wabash, they encountered a growing
                    assemblage of Indians. In addition to the Weas, Piankashaws, and other Wabash Indians, important
                    delegations of tribesmen from the Illinois country were also present. Jean Baptiste Ducoigne, the
                    leading chief of the Illinois Confederacy, led a mixed party of Kaskaskias and Peorias. Kickapoos
                    and Mascoutens from the Vermillion River were in attendance, as were several Potawatomis from the
                    Lake Peoria region. The Potawatomis were led by La Gesse (the Quail), a chief long known for his
                    anti-British sentiments. During the American Revolution La Gesse had guided a Spanish expedition
                    against a British post on the St. Joseph River, and in the period after the war he had consistently
                    opposed the attempts of British traders to extend their efforts down the Illinois River Valley.
                    Accompanying La Gesse was Jean Maillet, a Creole trader from Peoria who exercised considerable
                    influence over the Potawatomis and Kickapoos.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>On September 13 Putnam released the Wea and Piankashaw prisoners to their families, and the resulting
                    jubilation gave a holiday atmosphere to the frontier village. Meanwhile, preparations for the treaty
                    continued, and on September 19 drovers from Kentucky arrived with a herd of cattle to be used as
                    food during the proceedings. In the next few days additional <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The treaty negotiations started on September 24. After distributing tobacco to the Indians, Putnam
                    addressed the tribesmen, telling them that he represented the "great Chief General
                    Washington" whose "Council-Fire was burning bright … for the benefit of
                    all Nations." Recently, however, he stated, a cloud had passed between the council fire and
                    the western tribes, causing a darkness in which the Americans and Indians "could not
                    distinguish one another, but stumbled against each other, and struck the Tomahock in each others
                    heads." Putnam then assured his audience that he had been sent to remove the cloud and to
                    rekindle the fires of friendship between the United States and her red brothers.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the following day the Indians gave their formal reply. After presenting Putnam with a pipe and
                    several strings of white wampum, Ducoigne spoke for the assembled tribesmen. He assured the
                    Americans that although the Indians wanted peace, they were concerned over the loss of their lands.
                    He pointed out that "in the days of the French … all the Country was clear and
                    open," but the land recently had been "stained with blood." Ducoigne
                    blamed the British, charging that both British and Spanish agents "by giving us goods
                    endeavour to keep us strangers to you." He also accused the British of starting the
                    warfare. "It was the English," he claimed, "that gave us the tomhock to
                    strike you."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although Putnam and Heckewelder had anticipated Ducoigne's charges against the British, they
                    were surprised at his comments concerning land claims. As the Kaskaskia chief continued his speech,
                    he startled the commissioners by stating: "It is best that the white People live in their
                    own Country and we in ours. Formerly our lands were extensive. Now they are small. Therefore we wish
                    to keep what we have. We desire of you to remain on the other side of the river Ohio. These are the
                    sentiments of all the Chiefs and Warriors."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Following
                    Ducoigne's oration other chiefs also spoke and echoed his opinions. To the bewildered

                    Maumee Confederacy and were demanding that all American settlement be withdrawn from Indiana,
                    Illinois, and Ohio.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On September 26, when the proceedings reconvened, La Gesse of the Potawatomis came to the
                    Americans' rescue. He chided the other tribesmen for complaining that their lands were
                    shrinking. "If your land was dear to you," he asked, "why did you give it
                    away?" He then scolded the Weas and Piankashaws for not showing more respect to the United
                    States, stating that if Putnam journeyed to his village, the commissioner would be treated with the
                    proper honor and ceremony. Taking his cue from La Gesse's speech, Putnam asked the tribes
                    if they really wanted the United States to withdraw to Kentucky and to cut off all trade with the
                    Indians. He then assured the tribesmen that the Americans did not want their hunting grounds and
                    offered to show them on a map just how small were the lands that the United States claimed.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After examining the maps the tribesmen again met with the treaty commissioners and capitulated to the
                    American point of view. Ducoigne informed the officials that he did not mean that the Americans
                    "settled on this side of the Ohio should move away. Our request is that no other settlement
                    be made." He further assured Putnam that the tribesmen wanted American trade goods, stating
                    "We do not wish you to be strangers to us. We wish to be your good Neighbors and you to
                    send Traders among us, to furnish us for our wants as the French, English and Spaniards have
                    done." Putnam was pleased with Ducoigne's speech and concluded the session by
                    replying that he had no doubt that the Great Spirit had interceded to bring "harmony and
                    contentment to all parties."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On September 27, 1792, a "Treaty of peace and friendship" was signed by Putnam and
                    thirty-one representatives of the Wabash and Illinois tribes. The agreement pledged perpetual peace
                    and friendship between the Indians and the United States, forgave all past grievances, and placed
                    the Indians under the protection of the American government. Perhaps the most controversial item in
                    the treaty and the one that would generate the most trouble was article four, which guaranteed to
                    the tribesmen "all the lands to which they have a just claim; and no part shall ever be
                    taken from them, but by fair purchase, and to their satisfaction." It also provided that

            </p>
            <p>Following the completion of the negotiations, Putnam provided the Indians with four oxen and large
                    quantities of bread and brandy. Although Putnam and Heckewelder both suffered from "bilous
                    fever," the tribesmen were anxious to celebrate, and the festivities lasted for several
                    days. Finally, after the food and brandy were gone and the presents had been distributed, most of
                    the Indians began to leave for their villages.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Putnam made plans to maximize the impact of the treaty upon all the western tribes. He
                    sent a messenger to the hostile warriors along the Maumee, informing them that their brothers had
                    made peace with the United States and inviting them to join in the agreement. He also made
                    preparations to send several of the Wabash and Illinois chiefs to Philadelphia. Putnam believed that
                    these Indians would be awed by their contact with eastern civilization and that they then could be
                    coerced into assisting the United States in negotiating with the hostiles.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When news of the treaty reached Philadelphia, Knox was elated. Convinced that the United States had
                    achieved a diplomatic coup on the Wabash, Knox wrote to Wayne, predicting that Putnam's
                    efforts would successfully detach eight hundred warriors from the hostile confederacy. The secretary
                    of war also instructed Wayne to arrange for the safe passage of the Wabash chiefs to the capital,
                    ordering the general to insure that the Indians' journey would progress "under
                    circumstances of convenience and perfect security against all insults and danger."<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On October 5 sixteen Indians who had signed the treaty set out for Philadelphia. Accompanying the
                    warriors were Heckewelder, two Indian women, several interpreters, including Mail-let, and a small
                    squad of soldiers commanded by Captain Abner Prior. The party journeyed east across Indiana to Fort

                    On their way up the river the Indians stopped at Fort Washington where Sargent and Wilkinson gave a

                    however, the party met with disaster. As the Indians passed across southern Pennsylvania, smallpox
                    broke out among their ranks, and by December 26, when they reached their destination, two of the
                    chiefs had already succumbed to the malady. Government officials in Philadelphia immediately
                    innoculated the remaining Indians, but the smallpox continued to spread. During January, 1793, seven
                    more warriors, including La Gesse, also fell victim to the disease.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On February 1 the surviving Indians met with Washington, and Ducoigne spoke for the tribesmen,
                    pledging their friendship to the United States but asking the government to safeguard their lands
                    from the frontiersmen. Three days later the Indians again visited with the president, delivered
                    similar pleas, and sought assistance for the relatives of the recent smallpox victims.
                    Washington's reply remains unknown, but the tribesmen evidently were satisfied, for
                    following the conference they dined with the president and several Cabinet members.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>Although Knox was encouraged by the growing ties between the Wabash tribes and the government, he was
                    less optimistic about the progress of the treaty in the Senate. On February 13, 1793, the agreement
                    was presented to the Senate for ratification. It immediately encountered opposition. Many senators
                    believed that the fourth article of the document was too broad and that Putnam and Knox had been far
                    too generous in guaranteeing Indian title to lands along the Wabash. Other senators wanted the

                    The proposals were discussed for three days; the Senate then referred the treaty to a committee led
                    by Aaron Burr, which studied the document for ten days and reported back to the full Senate on
                    February 26. The treaty was debated for two more days, but the Senate still could come to no
                    decision. On February 28, 1793, <hi rend="i">the senators resolved to postpone further</hi>
                    discussion of the measure until the next session of Congress. Meanwhile, Washington and Knox were
                    instructed to renegotiate the treaty, guaranteeing the United States preemptive rights to Indian
                    lands in the Wabash Valley.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Knox, however, was busy with other affairs. During February he learned that the warriors along the
                    Maumee planned to meet in council on the Sandusky River in June. Knox knew that these Indians
                    remained hostile, and he was not optimistic about negotiating with them. Nevertheless, since the
                    Wabash and Illinois tribes had signed the treaty at Vincennes, the secretary of war thought that the
                    Maumee tribesmen might, perhaps, follow their example and that a diplomatic victory could be
                    achieved. Moreover, the surviving Wabash and Illinois chiefs were still in Philadelphia, and he
                    hoped that they could be persuaded to travel to Ohio and to use their influence in the
                    government's behalf. Knox therefore spent March and April of 1793 attempting to persuade
                    the remaining Wabash and Illinois warriors to journey to the Sandusky.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He met with only limited success. Ducoigne and the Wabash chiefs feared that their lives would be
                    threatened by the hostile Indians and refused to take part in the venture. Only two Potawatomis,
                    Gomo from the Illinois River and Waweachsetoh from the Tippecanoe, agreed to Knox's
                    proposal. During May, 1793, all of the Indians left Philadelphia and proceeded to Pittsburgh where
                    Gomo and Waweachsetoh, accompanied by the interpreter Maillet, separated from the party and
                    continued on by horseback toward the Sandusky. The remaining tribesmen, still escorted by Prior,
                    boarded canoes and descended the Ohio to their homes in the West.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

                    denounced the Potawatomis as American spies and used all of his influence to keep them from meeting
                    with the other tribesmen. On McKee's orders the Shawnees seized both the Potawatomis and
                    their interpreter, holding them captive until September when some Chippewas interceded in their
                    behalf. Although they finally were released, Maillet and the two Indians did not arrive back in
                    Vincennes until October 21, 1793.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While Gomo and Waweachsetoh were held captive by the Shawnees, the United States again attempted to
                    negotiate with the hostile tribes. During July and August American officials met with delegates from
                    the Indians along the Maumee, but the negotiations proved fruitless. The tribesmen demanded that the
                    Ohio River serve as the boundary between Indian and American lands, and the United States continued
                    to assert its claims to areas north of the river. Finally, in mid-August, the talks ended, and the
                    Americans returned to the East. Both sides realized that all hope for a peaceful settlement was
                    over, and during the following winter Wayne made preparations for his fateful march to Fallen
                        Timbers.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ironically, while Wayne planned his expedition to the Maumee, the Senate continued to debate the
                    treaty signed at Vincennes. On January 9, 1794, the Senate refused to ratify the document because
                    the agreement did not specify that the United States had preemptive rights to Indian lands in the
                    Wabash Valley. The senators preferred to wait, hoping that Wayne and a rebuilt army could impose a
                    military solution to the conflicting land claims in the Old Northwest.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Vincennes treaty of 1792 reflects the bankruptcy of American Indian policy in the period
                    following St. Glair's defeat. Anxious for any sort of success, government officials
                    willingly turned to the Wabash Indians after the more hostile Maumee tribes had spurned all offers
                    of American negotiations. The Vincennes treaty, however, was hardly the diplomatic coup envisioned
                    by Secretary of War Knox. Neither the Wabash tribes nor the Indians from Illinois were part of the

                    chiefs as Ducoigne and La Gesse had always opposed the confederacy, and although both resented
                    whites settling on their lands, they had remained constant friends of the Americans. Knox's
                    boast that the treaty would detach eight hundred warriors from the ranks of the hostiles was
                    optimism carried to the extreme. Undoubtedly the chiefs who signed the treaty had more than eight
                    hundred warriors in their villages, but most of these tribesmen were already friendly to the United
                    States.</p>
            <p>The pilgrimage of the chiefs to Philadelphia only added to the fiasco. Even if they had escaped the
                    smallpox, the treaty signatories would have been useless as emissaries to the hostile tribes. The
                    Indian leaders along the Maumee despised Ducoigne and La Gesse, and Ducoigne was well aware of their
                    hatred when he refused Knox's request that he go to Sandusky. Only such young and
                    inexperienced chiefs as Gomo and Waweachsetoh were foolish enough to accept Knox's offer,
                    and they barely escaped with their lives.</p>
            <p>As the Senate's actions indicated, even the terms of the treaty were unrealistic. Anxious to
                    clear Indian title from the lands north of the Ohio, the senators refused to ratify any
                    "Treaty of peace and friendship" that did not facilitate the transfer of such
                    lands to the United States. Putnam's promises that the Indians had "a right to
                    sell, and a right to refuse to sell" may have won him the friendship of the tribesmen along
                    the Wabash, but such altruism only assured the defeat of the treaty in Philadelphia.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Vincennes treaty negotiations have been defended as part of Knox's delaying tactics,
                    designed to give Wayne time to rebuild the western army.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> But such a position
                    gives too much credit to American diplomacy. Unquestionably, Knox wanted to keep warriors away from
                    the frontier, but the Indians who attended the treaty negotiations were already friendly to the
                    government. The hostile tribesmen, those warriors along the Maumee, refused to take part in the
                    proceedings and repudiated the treaty signatories. Indeed, while the treaty negotiations were in
                    progress, the hostiles continued to raid American shipping on the Ohio. Perhaps a more accurate
                    assessment of the treaty and its aftermath can be found in a letter from Knox to the president. On
                    January 2, 1794, the secretary of war wrote to Washington, admitting that "the expectation
                    of the treaty having been frustrated, nothing has been effected."<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

            <p>David Demaree Banta was born in the western part of Johnson County, Indiana, on a farm which his
                    father had hewn from the woods a year earlier.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The day was May 23, 1833, and
                    his parents, Jacob and Sarah (Demaree) Banta, named him after Sarah's father, David
                    Demaree, a presiding judge of Shelby County, Kentucky. Jacob and Sarah, of Frisian and Huguenot
                    descent respectively, had been born in Kentucky—he in Henry County, she in
                    Shelby—where their forebears had migrated in 1780 from Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Jacob
                    died only two years after David was born, as did an infant younger brother, but Sarah decided to
                    stay on the farm and was soon joined by her widowed mother and unmarried sister.</p>
            <p>After completing studies at a local grammar school, David Banta taught a few terms in another nearby
                    school in 1850–1851. Then, feeling restless, he traveled, partly on foot, to Iowa with a
                    friend early in 1852, working at odd jobs to earn his way. He read Blackstone in a law office in
                    Fairfield, Iowa, where he clerked during the fall and winter of 1852–1853, an experience
                    which led him to decide on law as a career. Returning to Indiana the following spring, David Banta
                    attended Franklin College briefly, and in the fall of 1853 he entered Indiana University where he
                    earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1855 and a Bachelor of Law degree in 1857. From 1856 <list type="footnotes">

                    Seminary in Bloomington.</p>
            <p>On June 6, 1856, while still in law school, David Banta married a widow, Melissa Riddle Perrin
                    (1834–1907), daughter of James and Elizabeth (Jackson) Riddle. Their first child, George
                    Banta, was born on July 16, 1857, at her parents' home in Covington, Kentucky. In the fall
                    of that year the Bantas moved to Franklin, Indiana, where their two other children were born:
                    Charles Banta on October 16, 1859, and Mabel Banta (later Beeson) on November 19, 1864.</p>
            <p>David Banta opened a law office shortly after moving to Franklin, but since his practice grew slowly,
                    he served as a deputy in the office of the county recorder for two years to augment his income. Then
                    from 1862 to 1864 he was the district attorney, Common Pleas Court, and from 1865 to 1868 the
                    division revenue assessor. He was also a county school examiner and trustee of the city schools
                    during that period and contributed articles to newspapers on Johnson County history. His articles
                    consisted of old settlers' tales that he had gathered in personal interviews during his
                    spare hours.</p>
            <p>In the meantime his reputation was growing. There is a family story, never authenticated, that he
                    became a local hero when, during the Civil War, he stood on his front porch and talked down an angry
                    mob threatening to tar and feather him on suspicion of his being a copperhead. They suspected it
                    partly because he was a Democrat, partly because his wife had southern family connections, partly
                    because he stressed moderation and reason at a time when men were crying war. Whether or not the
                    story is true, the claim that he talked them down is illustrative of David Banta's
                    persuasive abilities amid hostility. He became noted for the number of convictions he secured as a
                    young prosecuting attorney, and one story he himself liked to tell was about a jury member who
                    encouraged him privately to "stand up to them old lawyers" because the jury was
                    standing up for him.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>In 1870 David Banta was elected unopposed as judge of the Twenty-eighth Judicial Circuit on the
                    Democratic ticket. Retiring from the bench in 1876, he formed a partnership with Thomas W. Woollen,

                    David Banta was a member of the Board of Trustees at Indiana University and president of the board
                    from 1882 to 1889. Franklin College conferred on him the degree of LL.D. in 1888. In 1889 Indiana
                    University revived its law school, having discontinued it in 1877, and Judge Banta was made
                    professor of law and dean of the newly revived school, a position he held until his death on April
                    9, 1896.</p>
            <p>The judge's best known work was <hi rend="i">A Historical Sketch of Johnson County</hi>
                    (1881), but he also wrote numerous articles and short stories, kept many journals, and carried on a
                    vigorous correspondence. After his wife died in 1907, his collected writings passed to their older
                    son, George, who retained them in his personal library through the years; then after
                    George's death in 1935, his older son, Mark (1883–1941), donated the collection
                    to the D. D. Banta Library at the Phi Delta Theta headquarters at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio.
                    Mark did so because his father, George, had endowed the library in perpetuity in his will. Finally,
                    in 1970, the fraternity presented Franklin College, Franklin, Indiana, with 196 items from the
                    collection, retaining only what concerned the fraternity itself.</p>
            <p>The following letter escaped the collection, for good reason. It was written by the judge to his
                    younger son, Charles, who died in 1897, only a year after the judge. The letter stayed with
                    Charles' widow, Martha Graham Banta (b. 1861), who died in 1902 leaving three little
                    daughters. The oldest daughter died later in 1902, and the remaining two little girls, of whom
                    Elizabeth Banta Tolle (1889–1975), mother of Katharine Kell, was the elder, were reared
                    by a maternal aunt who kept their parents' memorabilia, including the letter from the
                    judge. The letter, therefore, never became part of the collection that the judge's wife and
                    older son preserved and which his grandson donated to the D. D. Banta Library. Probably none of them
                    knew the letter existed; probably, also, Elizabeth Banta Tolle did not want to part with it by the
                    time it came into her possession. The letter was located several months after Mrs. <list type="footnotes">

                                            Its interior was redone in the seventeenth century and again in 1871 after a

                                            preserver of game. In 1585, so the story goes, Lucy prosecuted Shakespeare
                                            for deer poaching, an offense which Shakespeare had compounded by writing a
                                            satirical ballad on Lucy. Shakespeare fled to London to escape imprisonment.
                                            Later he caricatured Lucy in the form of Robert Shallow, a pompous country
                                            justice, who appeared first in <hi rend="i">2 Henry IV</hi> (1597), then in

                                            scholars generally discount the deer poaching story, though they agree that
                                            Lucy was Shakespeare's target in his invention of Justice Shallow.
                                            The story's initial appearance was in Shakespeare's first
                                            biography (by dramatist Nicholas Rowe in 1709). By the time Judge Banta was

                        <p>We were doubly entertained in Oxford. We attended a political meeting at a village
                                    close by and heard Lord Valentia, the union Parliamentary candidate and Prof Dicey,
                                        speak.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> It was a real political meeting, but English. There
                                    was much cheering of a very poor sort and much speaking of a style that would not
                                    have enthused a Hoosier audience. Their meeting too was more formal than are ours.
                                    They had their chairman which was familiar, who introduced Mi-lord, who in the
                                    awkwardest manner imaginable made a very plain talk. Then the Prof, was introduced
                                    who offered a resolution to the effect that Mi-lord ought and must be elected and
                                    then made his speech. Next a young fellow seconded the resolution and spoke a few

                                                academic positions at Oxford. A professorship, then as now considered a
                                                great honor, was awarded discriminately and seldom. It usually meant
                                                relief from all duties except research and writing. As Judge Banta said,
                                                in the entire twenty-one colleges and two halls in 1895, Oxford had only

                                        Although there have been as many as thirty Inns, there now are four, named
                                        traditionally in the following order based on time of origin: Lincoln's
                                        Inn, Inner Temple, Middle Temple, and Gray's Inn. The Old Hall of
                                        Lincoln's Inn, which may have been where Judge Banta went to watch the
                                        proceedings, was built around 1490. All the Inns of Court are located in the
                                        vicinity of The Strand, Fleet Street, and Chancery Lane just north of the
                                        Thames; and they consist of large sprawling buildings with many wings, each Inn
                                        having a hall, a library, a chapel, and numerous chambers. Originally, they
                                        constituted a university for law students; now, although collegiate life has
                                        disappeared, the Inns still are the only ones with the power to grant and take
                                        away the title of barrister in England and Wales. Each of the Inns is
                                        autonomous, but they have a combined Council of Legal Education which directs
                                        the training of students and examines them for the bar. They are all
                                        unincorporated, their domination of England's legal system relying upon
                                        tradition. Hundreds of works have been written about the Inns of Court. A good

                                        known as the Central Criminal Court. It is located near Holborn, a few blocks
                                        east of the Inns of Court, and formerly adjoined Newgate Prison. In fact, the
                                        history of Old Bailey and Newgate is not separable. A bailey in medieval times
                                        was the space enclosed by the outer walls of fortifications. It is thought,
                                        therefore, that Old Bailey was originally situated in one such spot. It dates
                                        from the twelfth century and has been the scene of many famous criminal trials.
                                        A readable history of Old Bailey is by Bernard O'Donnell, <hi rend="i">The Old Bailey and Its Trials</hi> (New York, 1951).</item>

            <p>In the late nineteenth century, historians—inspired by the scientific ideal as were
                    intellectuals throughout the western world—determined to apply scientific method to
                    learning about the past. With the confidence exemplified by John B. Bury's trenchant
                    insistence that "history is a science, no less and no more," they aspired to
                    describe history <hi rend="i">wie es eigentlich gewesen ist</hi>, as it actually was.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Both the first generation of "scientific historians" and the
                    "new historians" who followed them insisted that they would approach their
                    subjects without preconceived notions; their interpretations were to be compelled by the facts.
                    Optimistically some tried to collect and interpret "hard," objective data such as
                    census records and voting statistics that would not be distorted by the biases of the historical
                    observer as they feared would be the case with more conventional, literary sources.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    inferences with confidence. Perhaps more worrisome, the nature of historical data seemed to preclude
                    truly scientific approaches to evaluation. Historians could follow the first steps of scientific
                    procedure—observation and reflection upon relevant data and formulation of an hypothesis.
                    But testing that hypothesis through "objective methods, which … yield
                    independently verifiable results" seemed impossible.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Natural
                    scientists could create "test tube" conditions permitting reproducible experiments
                    that established with near certainty the probability that hypotheses were true. Scholars hoping to
                    find laws of human behavior tried to adopt similar procedures, psychologists proving particularly
                    adept in doing so. Researchers studying human political behavior—long the central concern
                    of historians—demonstrated that one could test survey results (including those of the
                    largest survey of all, actual elections) against the results one would expect if an hypothesis were
                    true or false. Still humanists in the sense that they studied man, these "social
                    scientists" had an inestimable advantage over their colleagues who continued to study the
                    past: they could create their own data. This historians could not do. They could only absorb
                    existing information, never absolutely certain that it was reliable; draw a conclusion from it; and
                    then explain to their readers as convincingly as possible why they drew it. The evidence they had to
                    use was the same as that which had led them to their insight in the first place, augmented by new
                    information collected in light of that hypothesis. Walter Prescott Webb presented an intensely
                    personal glimpse into this process in his 1958 presidential address to the American Historical
                    Association. His first original historical insight was "the greatest creative sensation I
                    have ever known," he said. "It took a year to gather the proof of what I knew that

                    For scientists the insight leads to the formation of an hypothesis that is then tested empirically
                    for the probability of truth. When historians research materials in light of an insight, they cannot
                    be certain of their objectivity, no matter how committed they are to abandoning their insight if
                    there is not evidence enough to support it. This dilemma is due to what scientists call
                    "the selection tendency," the human mind's tendency to screen out facts
                    that do not correspond to preconceived notions.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The procedure seems to be
                    circular, the "conclusion" merely an untested hypothesis born of the personal
                    reaction of the reseacher to his data. Despairing of "objective" history, where
                    facts would compel proper interpretation, most historians by the 1930s were
                    "relativists," agreeing with Carl L. Becker that "even if you could
                    present all the facts the miserable things wouldn't say anything, would say just nothing at
                    all." Thus, through the medium of the historian, who must interpret facts subjectively,
                    "the past … is the product of the present."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                    Generally, historians are still relativists, though no longer so gloomy about accurate portrayal of
                    the past as Becker. In fact, most historians have made a virtue of what scientists would perceive as
                    the weakness of the historical method. Like Lawrence Stone, they speak lovingly of "that
                    feedback process by which … hunches are tested by data, and the data in turn generate new
                        hunches."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Eschewing "scientific" history,
                    historians still seek objective accuracy through what has been called "critical"
                    history: the use of nonscientific procedures to evaluate the reliability of evidence; dependence
                    upon training to avoid bias, presentism, and historicism; and hostility to efforts to establish
                    historical "laws" or to import the notion of "predictability"
                    into the discipline.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>Technological developments and advances in statistical measurement techniques since the 1940s have
                    reawakened interest in scientific procedures among historians. Computers now enable scholars to
                    manipulate massive amounts of data. Powerful statistical tools permit precise analysis of
                    relationships between variables. Many historians now call at least for more exact measurement of
                    inherently quantifiable information; many urge the application of sophisticated statistical methods
                    as well. Most encourage colleagues to utilize concepts developed by social scientists where
                    applicable; a few—most persistently Lee Benson—even urge historians finally to
                    adopt all the procedures of science; and the establishment of the <hi rend="i">Journal of

                    presidential administrations in order to uncover underlying patterns and broader trends of political
                    behavior. Insofar as American political historians have used new tools to challenge
                    predecessors' interpretations, they have approached the methods of the sciences: they have
                    treated these earlier interpretations as hypotheses and have developed research designs for testing
                    them through assessment of quantifiable data by methods that can be reproduced by other

                    compare voting patterns and social characteristics of groups of people. For example, finding that
                    the Republican percentage of the vote in counties across a state decreased as the proportion of
                    Catholics increased, these historians have suggested that Catholics voted disproportionately
                    Democratic. However, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the evidence and is an
                    illustration of what is called the "ecological fallacy." All that the aggregate
                    data really show is that the proportion of Catholics and the Democratic vote in counties were
                    positively associated; in the absence of further evidence there is no compelling reason to exclude
                    the possibility that the presence of large numbers of Catholics impelled Protestants to vote more
                    unitedly Democratic, thus accounting for the Democratic increase. In fact, the proportion of blacks
                    in counties of the Deep South was for years associated positively with Democratic voting, despite
                    the fact that almost no blacks voted.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Several of the "new"
                    political historians have tried to correct for the ecological fallacy by studying voting units
                    populated almost entirely by people sharing a particular characteristic, but as critics have pointed
                    out, one cannot tell if these cases represented accurately the behavior of individuals in more
                    heterogeneous environments.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hammarberg avoids the ecological fallacy by relying heavily on data about individuals derived from
                    nine <hi rend="i">People's Guides</hi> to central Indiana counties that in effect
                    constitute rare political and religious surveys of nineteenth century populations. These counties
                    were typical of the Midwest, he argues, and he suggests that his findings are therefore likely to
                    apply to the whole region. Utilizing innovative sampling techniques to correct for biases in the
                    surveys, Hammarberg employs powerful statistical tools to assess the makeup of political parties. In
                    the process he challenges some of the basic components of the ethnocultural model of party structure
                    and competition. Most important, Hammarberg finds that the most salient cleavage in the Indiana
                    electorate separated urban voters—by that he means residents of small towns and even
                    hamlets—from rural voters. Urban voters of every social description were more likely to
                    identify themselves as Republicans than were their bucolic counterparts—almost 70 percent

                    uniformly partisan (as Republicans) whether in town or countryside. Within towns the foreign born
                    differed radically from natives in their political predilections. Among the native born the rate of
                    Republican identification of a few groups differed marginally from the rest, but these differences
                    had little impact upon the whole picture. Among the farmers and farm workers only Methodists stood
                    out as significantly more likely to affirm Republicanism, while farm laborers, Roman Catholics, and
                    Lutherans tended to be more solidly Democratic than the rest of the population. Again variations
                    among other groups added little to the basic pattern.</p>
            <p>Having attended to the underlying patterns of party allegience, Hammarberg turns to the dynamics of
                    the actual elections of the 1870s, assessing to what degree and why specific election results
                    differed from the underlying partisan division. To do this Hammarberg first estimates the underlying
                    partisan divisions by averaging the Republican and Democratic proportion of the vote in each Indiana
                    county over several elections preceding the ones to be studied. Checking these averages against the
                    proportion of Democrats and Republicans as identified in the nine counties covered by the <hi rend="i">People's Guides</hi>, Hammarberg is satisfied that this averaging procedure
                    provides an accurate estimate of the long term party identification of the electorate. Through
                    regression analysis he then assesses what proportion of each election result was associated with the
                    basic partisan division in the electorate and what proportion was associated with other variables
                    specific to the individual election. Ultimately, he finds that by far the largest amount of
                    variation in each election was explained by the underlying party division, with the differences
                    between that division and actual results attributable to small but critical changes in turnout,
                    third party (Greenback) appeal, and the association between different social groups and the parties.</p>
            <p>Hammarberg's analysis modifies the conclusions of the "new" political
                    historians in some important respects and challenges them in others. First, while he too finds
                    significant differences in the voting patterns of foreign and native born electors, he points out
                    that immigrants made up less than 10 percent of the voting population. Thus the Democrats, who got
                    the larger proportion of the immigrant vote, still had to rely upon native Americans for the largest
                    portion of their support, just as did the Republicans. Likewise, only half the people listed in the
                        <hi rend="i">People's Guides</hi> identified with any religious denomination, and half
                    of those who did listed themselves merely <pb n="55" id="VAA4025-074-1-059"/> as
                    "Protestant" and nothing more. Thus over 50 percent of the central Indiana
                    electorate could not fit into a political model based primarily on religious and ethnic
                    identification. Moreover, Hammarberg challenges the notion that one can order religious
                    denominations from the most pietistic to most liturgical, as do several of the
                    "new" political historians—especially Richard Jensen and Paul Kleppner,
                    who claim Republican support came from pietists while Democratic support came from liturgicals.
                    Ranking denominations as do Jensen and Kleppner, Hammarberg does find a relatively strong
                    correlation mirroring their findings. But when he simply correlates political preference with
                    denomination identification without ordering the denominations, the procedure he insists is more
                    appropriate, the resulting correlation is very weak.</p>
            <p>Hammarberg also assesses the correlation between occupational status (a more easily defined variable
                    than the abstraction "class") and partisan identification. Here he finds a
                    significant correlation between partisanship and agricultural versus nonagricultural pursuits, a
                    correlation higher than the one he found between partisanship and religious identification using the
                    test he believes appropriate. This suggests that the "new" political historians
                    may have been too quick to reject older notions that economic issues dividing farmers from
                    townsmen—the Greenback issue in particular—were central to Indiana political
                    alignments in the 1870s.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Finally, Hammarberg suggests the degree to which
                    partisan identification seems to have been independent of all social variables, noting that such
                    variables explained only about 20 percent of the variation in the Republican vote.</p>
            <p>The importance of economic issues looms even larger when Hammarberg discusses the dynamics of
                    individual elections in the 1870s. The results of presidential elections paralleled very closely the
                    underlying partisan division, but the 1878 contest for state offices and the congressional
                    elections—especially those of 1874 and 1878—differed significantly from that
                    pattern, and the difference was associated largely with the Greenback <list type="footnotes">

                    1870s, from Republican dominance to significant Democratic victories, was apparently due to the
                    appearance of a party born out of economic grievances.</p>
            <p>Hammarberg is unwilling, however, to explain the shifts in Indiana's voting behavior in
                    terms of economics alone. Such a conclusion would imply that voters made rational choices, in this
                    case based on economic interest, an idea deprecated by modern social scientists.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Instead, he turns to voting models posited by the eminent political scientist Philip E.
                        Converse.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Hammarberg suggests that before the 1870s farmers and farm
                    workers were less politically involved than were townspeople and that rural residents had weaker
                    partisan attachments than did city dwellers. These differences occurred, he asserts, because farm
                    folk had less contact with the institutions—churches, schools, cultural
                    organizations—that provided links between social and political identification. According
                    to Converse, such politically uninvolved independents and weak partisans vote in disproportionate
                    numbers for winning presidential candidates but are less likely to vote in nonpresidential
                    elections. Usually this pattern of voting behavior leads to stronger correlations between underlying
                    partisan divisions and the actual vote in off year elections. It also explains why the party that
                    loses a presidential election usually receives a higher percentage of the vote in the following
                    congressional election. But, Hammarberg echoes Converse, this pattern may be reversed when some new
                    issue brings a wave of new information to the electorate. Strong partisans and uninformed
                    independents are the least likely to change their votes, while informed weak partisans and
                    independents are the most likely to do so in such a time of ferment. In nonpresidential elections
                    the <hi rend="i">uninformed, uninvolved</hi> independents, who would be unlikely to change their
                    previous votes, tend to stay home in disproportionate numbers, thus magnifying the effect of the

                    presidential elections in Indiana in the 1870s reflected the basic partisan divisions more
                    accurately than other elections, he suggests that the more unusual pattern that Converse describes
                    explains voting behavior in Indiana during the 1870s. The spread of the Grange and the depression
                    that began in 1873 led to a surge of political information and activity among rural weak partisans,
                    Hammarberg concludes, and it was this increased political and economic interest that led to the
                    electoral convulsions of the 1870s. In a further analysis, for some reason placed in an appendix
                    rather than in the body of the book itself, Hammarberg employs the technique of ecological
                    regression to estimate the number of voters who switched from one party to another between key
                    elections. He finds that the Greenback candidates drew more votes from Republicans than Democrats,
                    enabling Democrats to carry the state after 1874.</p>
            <p>In sum, Hammarberg has presented a model that he feels explains Indiana voting behavior in the 1870s:
                    presidential elections corresponded closely to an underlying partisan division in which Republican
                    support was associated with Quakerism, residence in small towns and hamlets, nonagricultural
                    occupations, and general Protestantism among small town and hamlet residents, while Democratic
                    support was associated with foreign nativity among townspeople and lower occupational status and
                    Catholicism or Lutheranism among those living in the open countryside (<hi rend="i">but</hi> in
                    which by far the greatest variation in political preference was unexplained by social
                    characteristics). Moreover, partisanship was stronger among townsmen and hamlet dwellers than among
                    more rural folk. In nonpresidential, and especially in congressional, elections in the 1870s the
                    least informed and politically involved voters—who tended to stabilize electoral voting
                    patterns—voted in fewer numbers, while better informed weak
                    partisans—concentrated primarily in the countryside, hit by depression, and suddenly
                    subject to new flows of information through recently established Grange
                    organizations—defected in large numbers from former allegiences and swung
                    disproportionately to the Greenbackers and the Democrats.</p>
            <p>Hammarberg's book may well provide the model for future studies of past voting behavior. His
                    decision to separate election results into a "normal vote" component (that is, the
                    component based on underlying partisan divisions) and a component specific to the individual
                    elections is certain to be followed, although other scholars may choose to define the
                    "normal vote" differently. His use of ecological regression parallels <pb n="58" id="VAA4025-074-1-062"/> Morgan Kousser's procedure in his study of southern
                    disfranchisement at the turn of the century and will help establish it as a staple tool of the
                    quantitatively oriented political historian.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Hammarberg has few peers among
                    historians in his knowledge of sampling methodology, and his procedure of adjusting for sample bias
                    should have a major impact. Finally, he is probably the first scholar to harness John A. Sonquist
                    and James N. Morgan's Automatic Interaction Detector (AID) program for historical
                    investigation; the form of the output is so appealing and so congruent with what historians want to
                    know that Hammarberg's colleagues are sure to want to experiment with it further.</p>
            <p>Despite his innovative statistical method, his reliance upon "hard," quantified
                    data, and his definition of a model to explain mass political behavior over a span of years,
                    Hammarberg's work illustrates the point made several years ago by a group of scientifically
                    oriented historians: "If there is a method to the historical craft it is that of the
                    detective—the careful collection of clues, the matching of one piece of evidence with
                    another, and ultimately the formation of an answer to what really happened. For all their radical
                    use of new methods, most historians interested in quantification have remained within this
                    tradition. Indeed most quantifiers claim that they simply possess a superior way of gathering
                    objective clues."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    use data to test his hypotheses about short term voter behavior (pp. 148–50), he never
                    really seems to do so. Although he does not explain his research design (itself an indication that
                    he is not following traditional scientific procedure), it seems that he applied his <list type="footnotes">

                    results, drew conclusions from them, then proceeded to explain to his readers why he drew those
                    conclusions—the same process historians using more traditional methods follow.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Thus Ham-marberg's model of Indiana voting dynamics in the 1870s is
                    more like an hypothesis, developed through an imaginative assessment of the data, but not certainly
                    tested after its formulation. Of course, his conclusions are congruent with the data he presents,
                    but one is not compelled by his method to concur in them. For example, although Hammarberg indicates
                    that he will test the application of Converse's understanding of the role of weak partisans
                    and independents in electoral shifts, he never does so. Demonstrating that the voting patterns of
                    the 1874 and 1878 congressional elections did indeed depart dramatically from the normal partisan
                    division reflected in the presidential year elections of 1876 and 1880, Hammarberg simply deduces
                    from that fact the role that weak partisans played in the changes and the link between weak
                    partisanship and rural voters (pp. 148–53, 168–76).</p>
            <p>The "hard" evidence he adduces to link volatile weak partisanship to rural voters
                    seems particularly questionable. To sustain this proposition, Hammarberg points primarily to the
                    nearly even Democratic-Republican division among countryside electors in his <hi rend="i">People's Guide</hi> counties. But such a group statistic cannot tell one how strongly
                    individuals felt about their allegiences. One may as well argue that voters were more strongly
                    committed to their parties in one party states like Vermont than in hotly contested ones like
                    Indiana. Hammarberg's confidence in this conclusion is bolstered by the fact that he found
                    almost no correlation between political preference and social characteristics among rural voters. He
                    suggests that few of the institutions that reinforce religious, ethnic, or economic identification
                    extended to the open countryside; thus, the most important determinants of political affiliation
                    were absent. But this is not additional evidence. It may explain <hi rend="i">why</hi> rural
                    Hoosiers were weak partisans <hi rend="i">if</hi> they were, but it cannot prove the original
                    proposition.</p>
            <p>Several tests seem appropriate. First, if Hammarberg is right, then there should have been a
                    substantially higher proportion <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">21</hi> That Hammarberg followed such a procedure seems obvious not only
                            because Hammarberg does not make a different procedure explicit (description of the research
                            design is one of the requirements of scientific procedure) but because the evidence he
                            offers to sustain his conclusions is not as persuasive as evidence specifically designed to
                            test an hypothesis would have been. Some tests are suggested below.</item>

                    town and village residents. But the data Hammarberg himself gives do not seem to sustain the
                    hypothesis. Hammarberg's sample indicates that 82.0 percent of the voters living in the
                    open countryside identified with one of the major parties while 87.3 percent of the townspeople did
                    the same. While the sample almost certainly reflects a real difference in the two groups (less than
                    twenty-five chances out of one thousand that it does not), the difference itself is not very big. In
                    fact the <hi rend="i">phi</hi> correlation between the two groups is a high .824, where complete
                    difference would be -l.0.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Second, if it is true that those who do not vote in off year elections are more likely to be
                    independents and weak partisans than those who do vote—an assumption critical to
                    Hammarberg's explanation of electoral dynamics in Indiana in the 1870s—and if
                    rural Hoosiers were less apathetic after the depression of 1873 excited their interest in politics,
                    there should have been a more strongly positive association between voter turnout and the degree of
                    a voting unit's "ruralness" after 1873 than before. For the same reason,
                    before 1873 there should have been a stronger relationship between the degree of a county's
                    "ruralness" and the decline in its number of voters in off year elections.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> In this case analysis bears out Hammarberg's hypothesis: there was
                    no significant association between "ruralness" and voter turnout in the elections
                    of 1868, 1870, or 1872, but there was such an association in the elections of 1874, 1876, and 1878.
                    In fact, the realtionship may have been stronger than Hammarberg indicates.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

                            In his text Hammarberg evaluates differences in overall partisan alignment—that
                            is, the different proportions of Democrats, Republicans, and independents—between
                            rural and nonrural voters (p. 131). But he does not test for differences in the proportions
                            of independents and the adherents of either major party—a test more directly
                            relevant to his thesis. Moreover, while he uses a <hi rend="i">chi</hi>-square test to show
                            the statistical significance of the differences, he does not use a measure of association,
                            such as Goodman and Kruskel's <hi rend="i">tau</hi> to describe the magnitude of
                            those differences. For appropriate measures of association for categorical data such as

                            1870s (p. 167). This leads him to suggest that rural weak partisans were the most active
                            agents in electoral change. But he does not test the pre-1873 and post-1873 relationships
                            separately, as he should do to see whether rural activity was the new phenomenon he insists

            <p>According to Hammarberg, the increased political activity among rural Indiana residents explains the
                    electoral shifts of 1874 and 1878, as rural weak partisans voted in disproportionate numbers against
                    Republican candidates, while nonrural weak partisans remained apathetic. Again, it seems that there
                    are several ways to test Hammarberg's proposition. For example, if it is true that
                    Democratic and Greenbacker gains in 1874 and 1878 were due to a shift in their direction by weak
                    partisans and independents, then the increase in the Democratic and Greenback vote should parallel
                    the increase in the number of independents Hammarberg found in the <hi rend="i">People's
                        Guide</hi> counties. In rural areas the independents would swing heavily to the Greenbackers and
                    Democrats, while in nonrural areas they would be more likely not to vote at all. Since Hammarberg
                    posits that independents would have been influenced more than strong partisans by the Republican
                    partisan drifts of 1872 and 1876, the independents' absence from the polls in nonrural
                    areas would deprive Republicans of support in off year elections even if they did not actively back
                    the Democrats. However, there was no such association.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand there was a fairly strong correlation between the number of independents Hammarberg
                    found in the <hi rend="i">People's Guide</hi> counties and the substantial Democratic gains
                    of 1874 over 1870 (<hi rend="i">r</hi>=.526). This suggests that Hammarberg may have at least
                    misconstrued the process by which turnout affected results. Rather than rural independents shifting
                    disproportionately <list type="footnotes">

                                are significant at the .03 level or better (three chances in a hundred that the
                                correlation actually was zero) but are not very high, explaining only about 5 percent of
                                the variation in voter turnout. Pearson's <hi rend="i">r</hi> ranges from 1.0,
                                a perfect positive correlation, to -1.0, a perfect negative correlation. An <hi rend="i">r</hi> of 0.0 describes no association at all. For a simple explanation, see <hi rend="i">ibid.</hi>, 103–24.</p>
                            <p>Since the 1870 and 1880 censuses did not provide rural-small town population breakdowns
                                at the county level, the ratios between each county's farm and manufacturing
                                production, number of farm and manufacturing business establishments, and number of
                                farms and population were used as surrogate statistics to test Hammarberg's
                                hypothesis. According to his tables Hammarberg was able to determine the proportion of
                                rural population in each county, but it is unclear how he derived the information.
                                Naturally, a more exact statistic might lead to still different results.</p>

                    to the Democrats in larger numbers than other voters as early as 1872 and stayed firm in their new
                    allegience. This political shift in 1872 might have been masked by the powerful appeal Republicans
                    made to their weak partisans on Reconstruction issues and by a lower than usual turnout among
                    Democratic weak partisans who were demoralized by the failure to nominate a straight Democratic

            <p>The tenuousness of Hammarberg's reliance on differences in weak partisan voter turnout in on
                    year and off year elections to explain election shifts is apparent when one compares voter turnout
                    and Democratic and Greenbacker gains in 1874 and 1878. If Hammarberg's model is accurate,
                    one would expect that the greater the voter turnout in 1874 compared to 1872 and in 1878 compared to
                    1876, the greater the increase would be in the Democratic and Greenbacker proportion of the vote.
                    This relationship holds true for the election of 1874 but not for that of 1878.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                  <hi rend="sup">29</hi> Ecological regression is based upon multiple regression analysis, which
                        solves an equation in which a dependent variable (for example, the Republican percentage of the
                        vote in 1874) is predicted from a series of independent variables (in this case, the Republican
                        percentage of the vote in 1872, the Democratic percentage, and the percentage not voting). Since
                        one knows the value of the independent variables (in this example, the voting percentages of
                        1872) and the dependent variable (the Republican percentage of the vote in 1874), one can find
                        how the independent variables must be weighted so that when they are added together they come as
                        close as possible to equalling the dependent variable in every case (in this example, in every
                        county). These weights (called betas) indicate how much the dependent variable will change for
                        each unit's change in the independent variable. Ecological regression translates the
                        formula into actual numbers for the situation in which the pattern is uniform over all units (in
                        this case, this means that the same proportion of 1872 Republicans are presumed to have voted
                        Republican in 1874 in every county, the same proportion of Republicans to have switched to the
                        Democrats, and so on). The wider the actual pattern diverges from this ideal, the less accurate
                        the prediction will be. In the election described by Table II, for example, the real pattern
                        diverged from the ideal by the estimate</item>

            <p>Table I complements nicely the small but statistically significant correlation between increased
                    turnout and Democratic gains in 1874 over 1872. It indicates that Republican losses (and the
                    corresponding gains in the Democratic percentage of the vote) were due to the failure to vote of
                    about one quarter of the voters who sustained the party in 1872. However, Hammarberg's
                    model does not very well explain the voting behavior estimated in the table. According to his
                    hypothesis, newly active rural weak partisans should have been more likely to vote in 1874 than
                    their small town and urban cousins and should have moved with what Hammarberg believed to be a
                    Democratic partisan tide. But the table suggests that hardly any of the defecting Republicans voted
                    Democratic in 1874 and draws into question the relationship Hammarberg posits between failure to
                    vote, weak partisanship, and partisan tides. If anything, Table I suggests a Republican partisan
                    tide because the regression equation estimates that Republicans gained votes in 1874 from electors
                    who supported the candidates of the Democratic-Liberal Republican coalition of 1872 and also carried
                    most of the 1874 voters who had not gone to the polls in 1872. Yet, in apparent contrast to this
                    success, over three times as many Republicans as Democrats are estimated to have stayed away from
                    the polls in 1874. This indicates that something beyond the mere tendency of weak partisans not to
                    vote in off year elections was involved in the Republican defection of 1874.</p>
            <p>Tables II and III suggest an equally complex story. It is apparent from Table II that there was no
                    real partisan drift toward the Republicans in 1876. Thus Hammarberg's suggestion that
                    Democratic and Greenbacker gains in 1878 were due in part to the failure to vote of weak partisans
                    who had been <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>that over 100 percent of the independent voters of 1874 voted for the Republican
                            congressional candidates in 1876. A negative proportion indicates the same thing.
                            Nonetheless, the vote predicted by the formulas is close enough to the actual vote to
                            suggest the general reliability of the figures. (Since the predicted vote is based upon the
                            population of two years earlier, it underestimates the total number of voters, explaining
                            part of the shortfall in actual numbers.) The only serious exception to this general
                            reliability is the proportions associated with the "Other" vote in Tables
                            II and III. For an explanation of regression analysis, the interested reader should consult

                    of 1876 cannot be completely accurate. While it is not impossible that Table III simply reflects the
                    shift of 27,500 primarily rural weak partisans from the Republicans to the Greenbackers and the
                    apathy of another 34,500 primarily non-rural Republicans and Democrats who did not vote in 1878,
                    such a conclusion is unlikely in light of the absence of a correlation between increased turnout and
                    Democratic and Greenbacker gains. Moreover, if Hammarberg's model were correct, one would
                    expect a positive association between Greenbacker gains and "ruralness," but there
                    is none.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Finally, Hammarberg's model does not explain why Democratic
                    weak partisans were not drawn to the Greenbackers as strongly as Republican weak partisans in 1878.</p>
            <p>In sum, the mechanistic elements of Hammarberg's model, based upon the propensities of weak
                    partisans not to vote in off year elections and linking weak partisanship to rural Hoosiers do not
                    seem to hold up. Hammarberg himself finds that turnout and "social
                    characteristics," among which "ruralness" was only one, explained only a
                    small proportion of the variation in the two party voting pattern in the 1870s (p. 171); they played
                    an even smaller part in the variation in patterns of Democratic and Greenbacker gains in 1874 and
                        1878.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> In fact, one familiar with the politics of the 1870s might suggest
                    different hypotheses, ones that endorse Hammarberg's position that voters were stimulated
                    by the issues of the 1870s but that minimize the importance of mere voter apathy, as it should be in
                    an age when 90 percent voter turnouts were common. One could hypothesize, for example, that
                    disgusted Republicans sat out the election of 1874 to protest the Salary Grab, the Credit Mobilier
                    fraud, and the other scandals that rocked their party in 1873 and 1874 and/or that Republicans who
                    favored measures to inflate the currency abandoned their increasingly hard money oriented party for
                    the Greenbackers in 1878 while Democrats, whose state organization already pressed for inflation,
                    felt no need to follow suit. These hypotheses are congruent <list type="footnotes">

                    and the assessments of contemporary political observers. Hammarberg has written a valuable and
                    instructive book—valuable and instructive both in its successes and in its shortcomings.
                    The imaginative use of statistical methods—which in this review have even been used to
                    challenge some of Hammarberg's conclusions—and the description they permit of
                    the basic partisan divisions in Indiana in the 1870s will be of lasting significance. But the
                    shortcomings are no less instructive. Most graduate training in history puts slight emphasis on the
                    role of hypothesis development and testing in research. It is a procedure as essential for those
                    using conventional sources as for those utilizing quantitative methods, but its importance is more
                    obvious where data can be easily reproduced and harnessed to test researchers' conclusions.
                    Clear formulation of hypotheses and a carefully constructed and articulated research design to test
                    them would have demonstrated the weakness of Hammarberg's model in explaining short term
                    changes in voting results (or, if the conclusions in this review are in error, would have made a
                    more convincing case based on more appropriate tests than are offered in the book or in this
                    critique). As Alfred North Whitehead explained forty years ago, the formulation of "an
                    hypothesis directs observation, and decides upon the mutual relevance of various types of evidence.
                    In short, it prescribes method."<hi rend="sup">32</hi> In <hi rend="i">The Indiana
                    Voter</hi> it appears that Hammarberg did not approach his data with methods prescribed by his
                    hypothesis. Such procedure, or lack of it, suggests that instead of quantification subverting the
                    traditional historical craft, as many conventional historians have worried that it would, the
                    shortcomings of the traditional historical method are subverting the scientific orientation of the
                    quantification movement.</p>

            <head>Awards of Merit and Certificates of Commendation from American Association for State and Local
                    History</head>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Certificate of Commendation</hi> is given for outstanding achievement by an
                    individual or an organization in the field of state, provincial, and local history, but with that
                    achievement judged in the light of local limiting circumstances rather than on a basis of overall
                    excellence in the United States and Canada as a whole. The certificate is a pat on the back and says
                    to the individual or organization that receives it: "We think you are doing a wonderful job
                    in your area, and we want to recognize you for it." Such recognition was made in Indiana in
                    1977 to the Fulton County Historical Society for promoting the preservation and understanding of
                    Fulton County History, to Thelma Confer for her historical and architectural paintings of
                    Indiana's history, and to the Noblesville <hi rend="i">Daily Ledger</hi> for its
                    bicentennial exhibit, "Indiana's History through the Printer's
                    Art."</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Award of Merit</hi> was the original award of the American Association for State and
                    Local History and is still the backbone of its competition. It is given for excellence of
                    accomplishment or program in the field of state, provincial, and local history and is in no way
                    judged relative to local limiting circumstances. The giving of the Award of Merit is the same as
                    saying to everyone: "This is public acknowledgment by the American Association for State
                    and Local History that this accomplishment or this program, in comparison with all similar
                    accomplishments and programs in North America, deserves the adjective excellent." The
                    Indiana awards for 1977 were made to Donald F. Carmony for contributions to the scholarly study and
                    public understanding of the history of the state of Indiana and to Thomas S. Emison for his
                    leadership and contributions in preserving the heritage of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Nomination forms are available from Gayle Thornbrough, executive secretary, Indiana Historical
                    Society, 315 West Ohio Street, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202. Miss Thornbrough is chairman for
                    nominations from Indiana for 1978. All nominations must be made on the "Awards Nomination
                    Form" and <hi rend="i">postmarked by not later than May 21, 1978.</hi> Each nominator must
                    include a supporting letter which is explicit in indicating why the award or certificate seems
                    merited. Each nominator is also responsible for making certain that at least two or three other
                    persons send similar statements <hi rend="i">directly to the state chairman.</hi> Finally, each
                    nominator should send relevant supporting material such as pamphlets, newspaper clippings, programs,
                    scripts, and books.</p>

            <p>Viewed from the last quarter of the twentieth century, the life of Calvin Fletcher as conveyed
                    through his diary seems far removed from conditions in Indiana in the 1970s. Travel in the
                    midnineteenth century, for example, lacked the speed and comfort to which Hoosiers today are
                    accustomed. In February, 1853, it took Fletcher from noon on Tuesday until noon on Thursday to make
                    the trip by railroad from Cincinnati to Indianapolis (p. 18). Nevertheless, Fletcher traveled more
                    than usual during the years from 1853 to 1856, and his accounts speak of "cold
                    dissagreable" railroad travel (p. 358) and "dark &amp; gloomy"
                    lodgings with "No furnature or conveniences" (p. 450). The distance between now
                    and then appears greatest where advances in technology intervene. A generation reared on the marvels
                    of modern medicine must be shocked at how little beyond prescribing camphor, mustard poltices, and
                    morphine the doctors of the time could do for Sarah Fletcher in her final illness. Considering the
                    great number of material changes which have occurred between 1856 and 1978, the wonder is how much
                    of Fletcher's life appears "modern" in other respects.</p>
            <p>Fletcher's relations with his sons, for example, illustrate the contemporary quality of the
                    diary. Like many fathers today he wanted his children to succeed and to profit from his experience
                    and wisdom. Fletcher found it particularly hard to communicate with his son Billy who quit school,
                    chose questionable friends, disgraced himself and his family, and left home without a word to his
                    father. More than one father today can sympathize with Fletcher's anguish in desiring to
                    deal rightly with his son. "At first thought I would punish him &amp; start him
                    immediately on his trip. This on reviewing my relation, &amp; my duties I decided wrong that I
                    had [as] a father to subject him &amp; send him into the world right—not a bad
                    rebellious boy but an upright young man. I have prayed God to give me wisdom to instruct &amp;
                    rescue him from the evil views he has" (p. 391).</p>
            <p>Nor did Fletcher escape the anxieties of living that current generations tend to consider peculiarly
                    modern. Though a success by conventional standards, he was haunted by gloom and <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-074-1-076"/> depression. In early 1853 he wrote: "I often feel gloomy yet I
                    should not" (p. 8). The death of his wife increased his depression and may explain the
                    relative haste he displayed in selecting a new wife in the face of his children's
                    objections. His melancholy may have arisen, in part, from dissatisfaction with the direction his
                    life had taken. Increasingly he confided to his diary a longing to withdraw from his many
                    responsibilities and retire to his farm. In explaining his yearning for the pastoral life he
                    declared: "I never had doubts but that what was dependent on physical force I could do but
                    what depends on the mental exertion I have doubted" (p. 206). This is a strange admission
                    from one whose career had centered on law, business, and banking, but one perhaps understandable to
                    his twentieth century counterparts.</p>
            <p>The value of the diary for scholars lies not so much in how well it relates to twentieth century
                    experience as in what it reveals about midnineteenth century conditions in Indianapolis and in the
                    state. The diary continues the informative business and political commentary of the earlier volumes.
                    Students of business history will benefit from Fletcher's observations about free banks and
                    the Bank of the State of Indiana. The former he viewed with apprehension, the latter with suspicion.
                    They will also benefit from his intimate knowledge of railroad development in the state,
                    particularly the Indianapolis and Bellefontaine Railroad, which he served for a time as president.
                    Political scholars of the period will view with interest his characterizations of public men and his
                    charges of corruption in politics.</p>
            <p>Similarly the diary continues to reflect Fletcher's interest in education and reform. Of all
                    his activities Fletcher seemed to find the most satisfaction from his service as trustee of the
                    Indianapolis common schools, which position he assumed in January, 1853. His duties included hiring
                    and dismissing teachers, school discipline, visitations, arranging examinations, inspecting and
                    making recommendations on school facilities, and reporting quarterly to the Indianapolis City
                    Council, and very little escaped his attention. From these experiences he confided to his diary his
                    candid impressions of education in Indianapolis. Fletcher's considerable interest in reform
                    centered on the temperance and Free Soil movements. Temperance suffered a near fatal blow in Indiana
                    when the state supreme court in 1855 declared a Maine type prohibition law unconstitutional.
                    Following this, Fletcher directed his talents to the Free Soil movement on which he pinned his hope
                    for a "better future" (p. 595).</p>
            <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-074-1-077"/>
            <p>From the beginning of the publication of this multivolume diary the editors sought a "median
                    ground between pedantic fidelity and readability" (vol. I, p. xxv). Each volume has lived
                    up to that standard. Such editorial aids as a survey introduction, a chronology of events, and an
                    extensive index all contribute to the diary's readability. Careful editing of the
                    manuscript and wide ranging notes drawn from both primary and secondary sources provide the scholar
                    with the fidelity needed for research. The diary, in sum, provides a readable and reliable source of
                    valuable information for both the general reader and the scholar.</p>

                        Record of Opinion.</hi> By Wesley Norton. (Athens: Ohio University Press, 1977. Pp. xi, 196.
                    Notes, bibliography of religious newspapers, index. $12.50.)</head>
            <p>If all the religious newspapers published in the Old Northwest to 1861 could be put in a pile, they
                    would make a very large mound indeed. All who read this book will know that Wesley Norton has worked
                    in the scattered remnants of that mound with diligence and unusual comprehension. He offers the
                    reader a vicarious trip through many an acid flecked file.</p>
            <p>His "Bibliography of Religious Newspapers with Library Holdings" (p.
                    159–78) gives an indication of the bulk of the research material. There are 176 entries
                    in this helpful list, but newspapers which were absorbed by others (e.g., the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Religious Intelligencer</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Western Luminary</hi> by the Cincinnati <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>) are not cross-indexed. As a consequence the number of papers searched far
                    exceeds the 176 bibliographical entries.</p>
            <p>Norton argues that the Old Northwest is an appropriate place to study religious newspapers. It is a
                    frontier which combines many elements of the American population and of the American experience. The
                    assortment of newspapers demonstrates the individualism and diversity of the region. But how can the
                    author generalize about such an amorphous mass of newspapers on the basis of so many scattered
                    readings and soundings? He does so with difficulty and with 464 footnotes, many of them compound, to
                    validate his opinions. One comes to have confidence in the procedure. Norton will advance a
                    generalization, give some annotated examples from the newspapers to support it, and perhaps cite an
                    exception or two. There is the <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-074-1-078"/> impression that he has sufficient
                    instances to support his judgments. The positions usually fit well with the conclusions of other
                    research on the period, which he gives evidence of knowing. However, Norton is by no means limited
                    to redocumenting the findings of other historians.</p>
            <p>The book does let some of the life and vigor of the newspapers come through. There is the idealistic
                    drive of the denominational leaders to establish newspapers, sadly tempered by discovery of what it
                    takes to make a newspaper run. Proprietors could hardly get subscribers, could hardly get
                    subscribers to pay, and could hardly bring themselves to drop subscribers when they did not pay.
                    Editors were usually clergymen not trained for newspaper work. They received little or no pay, and
                    often enough they lost their own money in the enterprise. But they felt this work of publication
                    must be done. Four chapters of the book offer a subject approach to the editorial content of the
                    newspapers. These chapters reflect the denominational invective which is stout and the moral advice
                    which is heavy. Commentary on public policy and especially on slavery, or abolitionists, is
                    considered godly journalistic duty.</p>
            <p>Norton says that the "uniqueness of the <hi rend="i">antebellum</hi> religious newspaper was
                    in its blend of secular and religious purposes" (p. 2). He demonstrates the blend of the
                    secular and religious. The uniqueness of such a blend, however, is not demonstrated and may well be
                    unprovable. But this assertion is in no way essential to the book. Norton's research in
                    this group of religious newspapers has its own value. His report of that research is both
                    stimulating and useful.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Frontier: Comparative Studies.</hi> Edited and with an introduction by David
                    Harry Miller and Jerome O. Steffen. (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1977. Pp. viii, 327.
                    Notes, figures, maps, tables, index. $14.95.)</head>
            <p>This book, a product of the University of Oklahoma program in comparative and interdisciplinary
                    frontier studies, is a diverse collection of articles which have little in common other than a
                    frontier theme. The authors are from a variety of disciplines, and the essays vary widely in setting
                    (Roman Empire to outer space), purpose, method, and terminology.</p>
            <p>John Hudson, a geographer, examines social science methodologies applicable to frontier studies. He
                    combines theories of land use competition and innovation diffusion to <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-074-1-079"/> suggest four possible models for understanding frontier dynamics.
                    Anthropologist H. Leedom Lefferts, Jr., analyzes frontier demography and offers an explanation for
                    frontier fertility patterns. He proposes the study of frontier populations from the vantage of
                    biological ecology.</p>
            <p>In one of three articles on Roman frontiers, historian John Eadie shows that the basis of Roman
                    frontier policy was control of native peoples through acculturation. David Miller and William
                    Savage, historians, document the stereotyping of native peoples on Roman and American frontiers.
                    Germans and Indians, they assert, were stereotyped as subhumans for political and expansionist
                    purposes. Another historian, William Cooter, proposes that relations between Romans and native
                    peoples be viewed in terms of "interaction spheres," regions of trade and culture
                    linkages.</p>
            <p>Archaeologist Kenneth Lewis studies early Virginia to show how archaeological data and methods can be
                    used to recognize and interpret the process of cultural change in frontier areas. Geographer David
                    Wishart takes a well known subject, the fur trade of the American West, and gives it a new
                    perspective through analysis as an ecosystem. The Canadian Shield is the setting for two articles by
                    geographers. Brian Osborne describes nineteenth century assessments of environments in two eastern
                    Ontario counties and shows how changes in technology, economics, and vested interests served to
                    alter land use perceptions. Similarly, Geoffry Wall chronicles the failure, as a result of
                    inaccurate resource evaluation, of efforts to develop the Muskoka region. Sociologists David Bailey
                    and Bruce Haulman investigate and compare, through sociological analysis of manuscript census data,
                    ethnic makeups of San Antonio and Santa Fe in 1860.</p>
            <p>Anthropologist Emilio Willems explores in Latin America the "anonymous frontier" of
                    the "little man" who, rather than finding economic success, attains a standard of
                    living only somewhat better than he knew before. Willems considers shantytowns in cities as
                    comparable to rural frontiers. Martin Katzman, a regional planner, reviews several neoclassical
                    theories on the social relations of production and makes an abbreviated attempt to test the validity
                    of these theories on two Brazilian frontier regions. The Amazon Basin is the setting for an article
                    in which anthropologist Stephen Thompson uses a cultural ecology approach to assess the prospects
                    and problems of colonization programs.</p>
            <p>The editors, both historians, take historians to task for the noncomparative nature of traditional
                    historiography. They <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-074-1-080"/> maintain that historical generalizations
                    need to be analyzed and tested through the interdisciplinary approach of comparative studies. This
                    may be so, but comparative study, at least at this point of development, appears of limited utility.
                    It is not truly comparative. There is too little common ground. This volume indicates that each
                    discipline remains largely isolated, enmeshed within the structure of its own perspectives,
                    methodology, and terminology.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Jefferson's Nephews: A Frontier Tragedy.</hi> By Boynton Merrill, Jr.
                    (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1976. Pp. xv, 462. Maps, illustrations, appendixes, notes,
                    bibliography, index. $16.50.)</head>
            <p>The story of the Lewis family is indeed tragic, but the tale is more gothic than classical. The
                    connection with Thomas Jefferson was real enough, but it is of doubtful significance because
                    Jefferson avoided his Lewis relatives as much as possible. Both families lived in Albemarle County,
                    Virginia, and in the familiar pattern of southern gentry intermarried through several generations.
                    Charles Lilburne Lewis married his first cousin, Lucy Jefferson, while two of his sons married
                    second cousins and a daughter married a double first cousin known as Thomas Jefferson, Jr., a nephew
                    of the Sage of Monticello.</p>
            <p>This widely praised book is the work of a Kentucky attorney who currently owns part of the Lewis
                    lands. His richly detailed story is the account of the rise and tragic fall of a family who
                    possessed pride, land, slaves, and great dreams which were always exceeded by their debts. Jefferson
                    struggled for a lifetime to make a living from the red soil of the piedmont, but the Lewises
                    admitted their failure and moved to Kentucky in 1808, a journey taken by many fellow Virginians.
                    They purchased several thousand acres along the Ohio River in Livingston County, land enough for
                    speculation as well as for farming. Merrill describes Virginia and Kentucky society in sometimes
                    excessive detail, largely from secondary works, but his account of the Lewises is drawn from an
                    exceptionally close study of family papers and legal records. His story advances at a leisurely
                    pace, and the fateful crime does not come until chapter twenty-five.</p>
            <p>The doomed protagonist is Lilburne Lewis. Widowed and newly remarried, he was troubled by the death
                    of his beloved <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-074-1-081"/> mother, imminent financial ruin, and poor health
                    throughout the family. The year 1811 was one of strange omens, from heavy flights of passenger
                    pigeons to Halley's Comet, and the troubled Lilburne began to show a strain of madness that
                    led to heavy drinking and frequent abuse of his slaves. He turned on a seventeen year old slave
                    named George and, with the help of his ne'er do well younger brother Isham, tied him on the
                    floor and attacked him with an ax while his horrified slaves were forced to watch. The corpse was
                    dismembered and the pieces thrown into the fire when suddenly the first shock of the great New
                    Madrid earthquake brought down the chimney on the terrible scene. The slave's remains were
                    hidden in the rebuilt chimney. Later shocks tumbled it again, however, and a neighbor discovered the
                    head.</p>
            <p>Lilburne and Isham Lewis were indicted for murder, and Lilburne's new wife abandoned him.
                    Faced with total ruin and utter disgrace, Lilburne talked Isham into a suicide pact. They went to
                    the family graveyard, and Lilburne dropped his unwitnessed will and some last words on the ground
                    near the grave of his beloved first wife, describing himself as "a victim to my beloved but
                    cruel Letitia. I die in the hope of being united to my other wife in Heaven" (p. 295). The
                    brothers prepared to shoot one another, but Lilburne paused to show how a survivor could dispatch
                    himself in the event of a misfire. While demonstrating how to fire a rifle with a stick, Lilburne
                    shot himself through the heart, and Isham ran from the scene. He was arrested and jailed, but he
                    somehow made his escape and vanished without a trace.</p>
            <p>The Lewis tragedy is a fascinating counterpoint to the more familiar story of frontier success.
                    Indeed, this contrast between success and failure provides a subtle moral for this gruesome tale, an
                    essential reminder that frontier hardship did not inevitably lead to the democratic prosperity
                    imagined by uncritical readers of Frederick Jackson Turner and John D. Barnhart.</p>

                    States government into the region between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. The expedition in
                    1838 began at Fort Snelling and penetrated the Coteau des Prairies in eastern South Dakota. The one
                    of 1839 moved from St. Louis up the Missouri River to Fort Pierre, crossed over to Devil's
                    Lake in North Dakota, and moved down into the Minnesota River Valley. Federal officials published
                    Nicollet's map and report dealing with the geography of the region, but his personal papers
                    remained unprinted and, after his death in 1843, scattered in many repositories. This volume
                    contains notes and journals kept by Nicollet that supplement the observations of Meriwether Lewis
                    and William Clark, Stephen H. Long, George Catlin, and other earlier travelers about flora, fauna,
                    geography, geology, and climatic conditions in the same area, and about aboriginal Dakota Indian
                    politics, language, and sociology.</p>
            <p>Editors Edmund C. Bray and Martha Coleman Bray have written a substantial introduction to describe
                    circumstances surrounding the initiation and completion of Nicollet's two expeditions. They
                    have explained the contents of his journals with chapter introductions and explanatory footnotes.
                    They have included three appendixes, which contain some of Nicollet's correspondence,
                    expeditionary lists, and ethnographic writings on the Dakota Indians. And they have prepared an
                    eleven page index, which makes their book valuable as a source for researchers as well as for
                    general readers with interest in the problems of nineteenth century exploration, in historic places
                    between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, in the work of missionaries along the Minnesota River
                    Valley during the 1830s, and in other subjects.</p>
            <p>Prospective readers should be aware that Nicollet's appraisal of Sioux Indian culture is
                    neither as accurate nor as complete as those written by others later on—those published
                    by James William Lynd, Stephen Return Riggs, John P. Williamson, James Owen Dorsey, and Alice
                    Cunningham Fletcher, to name a few. But that is not the fault of the editors. They have done an
                    excellent job assembling and editing a valuable collection of material on topography, ecology,
                    native American society, and exploration in the north central United States during the second
                    quarter of the nineteenth century.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Joseph Smith: The First Mormon.</hi> By Donna Hill. (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday
                    &amp; Company, Inc., 1977. Pp. xviii, 527. End maps, illustrations, appendix, notes,
                    bibliography, index. $12.50.)</head>
            <p>Nearly a century and a half ago Joseph Smith crisscrossed the state of Indiana several times en route
                    from Kirtland, Ohio, the site of his templed headquarters, to Missouri. There, utopian Mormon
                    settlements were engulfed in an open war with their neighbors who resented the peculiar doctrines
                    and the sudden encroachment of the Mormon communes. Smith's impact on Indiana was virtually
                    nil even though contemporary records note his presence in Richmond, Indianapolis, and Terre Haute.
                    Smith appeared inconsequential and fleeting, then, as only one of a myriad of religious mavericks on
                    the frontier. Today there are substantial congregations of Latter-Day Saints in the major
                    communities of Indiana and the nation. It is increasingly impossible to dismiss this man whose
                    mission created America's tenth largest religion, yet publications about him have been
                    largely partisan, often not trustworthy. Donna Hill has now presented an independent study, free of
                    any sanctions or sponsorship, that demands attention, certainly the most important work since Fawn
                    McKay Brodie's biography in 1945.</p>
            <p>Written for the general reader, the book lacks sophisticated interpretation that might fascinate
                    professionals, but it digests the voluminous research that continues to emerge since the
                    controversial Brodie study. It is a work that will shock some of the faithful because it suppresses
                    nothing, neither peepstones, nor gold digging, nor polygamy, nor Danites (vigilantes), nor poverty,
                    nor financial mismanagement, nor vengeance. Secular readers will be perplexed because Hill presents
                    Smith just as he claimed to be—a prophet. Several interchanges with angels and diety are
                    described unapologetically as real. In this narrative the fabled gold plates which served as a basis
                    for the <hi rend="i">Book of Mormon</hi> are treated as fact, not fancy. The visionary appearances
                    at the Kirtland Temple dedication are presented as actual, and other divine interventions are
                    detailed without any psychohistorical explanations. The book, therefore, is an unusual mixture of
                    historical candor and religious feeling.</p>
            <p>Striking elements about Smith's paternal home in western New York emerge from the book: the
                    tradition of visions for two generations, the intense interest in religion, and the financial crises
                    that plagued the farming family. Hill includes numerous laudatory and defamatory eyewitness
                    statements, <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-074-1-084"/> often in their original crude English, about the
                    Smiths. The readers are continually enticed, like detectives, to weigh the evidence from these
                    conflicting testimonies and draw their own conclusions. In this manner the author avoids being an
                    apologist or a vilifier.</p>
            <p>Once the initial heavenly experiences are examined—the first vision, the golden plates,
                    and the priesthood restoration—the narrative turns its focus to the tortured hegira of
                    the American prophet and his people who built short lived sacred cities in Kirtland, Ohio; Jackson
                    and Caldwell counties in Missouri; and finally in Nauvoo, Illinois. The experiments in each place
                    were opposed by neighbors who could not countenance the Mormon claim of exclusive salvation and
                    their practice of economic cooperation. The resulting confrontations brought out the ugliest
                    dimensions of the Missouri and Illinois frontiersmen and their weak governments.</p>
            <p>The author also describes the "Saints'" internal difficulties and excesses
                    which fanned the flames of violence. Secret polygamy, freemasonry, a private army, bloc voting,
                    Smith's presidential candidacy, and finally the destruction of an opposition press in
                    Nauvoo are cited as provocations that increased polarization and finally led to the mob
                    assassination of Smith and his brother in 1844. Joseph Smith's life appears so hectic in
                    the face of persecutions and arrests that the reader wonders when any sublime moments were left for
                    religious reflection. There is unfortunately little analysis of his thought, leaving the book short
                    in that important dimension. Hill presents detail well, but all the parts never quite make a whole.</p>
            <p>In some ways this study is a joint effort. Though Hill is the sole author and a skilled writer, the
                    manuscript enjoys the benefit of the lifetime research by her brother, Dr. Marvin S. Hill. Thus the
                    work includes voluminous notes and the most current bibliography. Nonetheless, the author succeeds
                    in her goal of "presenting] the dramatic and human elements of his story, …
                    show[ing] the warmth, spirituality and joyousness for which his people loved him, but also his
                    foibles, his implacable will and something of his complexity" (p. x). The book is not the
                    definitive book on Joseph Smith. Like the study of Napoleon, there will be a cycle of significant
                    books on him for decades to come. The Hill book is clearly the one for the 1970s.</p>

                        1861–1868.</hi> By Mary Frances Berry. (Port Washington, N.Y.: Kennikat Press, 1977.
                    Pp. x, 132. Notes, bibliographical essay, index. $8.95.)</head>
            <p>"The right of the Negro is the true solution of our national troubles," Frederick
                    Douglass declared hopefully in the <hi rend="i">Atlantic Monthly</hi> in December, 1866.
                    "The stern logic of events, which goes directly to the point, disdaining all concern for
                    the color or features of men, has determined the interests of the country as identical with and
                    inseparable from those of the Negro." Mary Frances Berry's essay on civil rights
                    policy during the Civil War and Reconstruction is an exploration of Douglass' theme.
                    Although reductionist and necessarily limited in its capacity to explain complex historical changes,
                    Berry's argument has the virtues of simplicity and objectivity.</p>
            <p>Berry contends that the nation's military needs lay at the foundation of what Douglass
                    described as the stern logic of events. In a struggle for national survival, assumptions of white
                    supremacy lost some of their potency, and improvements in the legal status of blacks became
                    possible. Berry finds evidence for this thesis in the Revolutionary War and (particularly in New
                    Orleans, with its free black militia) during the War of 1812. But the relationship between military
                    necessity and black citizenship emerged most clearly and significantly during the Civil War. As
                    Berry explains, every step in the process toward emancipation and enfranchisement was justified by
                    arguments of military necessity and public safety.</p>
            <p>Berry sees similar forces at work in contemporary America. When "the resolution of a
                    military or other crisis should dictate egalitarian racial policy solutions, the law will be
                    interpreted to permit such solutions, or the Constitution will be amended" (p. 107). White
                    America, generally unmoved by lofty arguments of morality and human rights, responds promptly and
                    positively when military victory requires black participation.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, rights granted for reasons of military necessity are not necessarily respected once
                    the immediate crisis has passed. As Douglass lamented in 1866, "prophets indeed, were
                    abundant before the war; but who cares for prophets while their predictions remain unfulfilled, and
                    the calamities of which they tell are masked behind the blinding blaze of national
                    prosperity?" With little faith in America's capacity to listen to her prophets,
                    Berry concludes simply: "When military expediency receded, theories of the inferior legal
                    status of blacks became again dominant" (p. x).</p>

               <hi rend="i">When Farmers Voted Red: The Gospel of Socialism in the Oklahoma Countryside,
                        1910–1924.</hi> By Garin Burbank. (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1976. Pp. xvi,
                    224. Tables, notes, appendixes, maps, essay on sources, index. $13.95.)</head>
            <p>When Oklahoma became a state in 1907, many of its citizens were already trying to cope with the same
                    types of problems that faced people in other, older, parts of the country. Like their neighbors to
                    the south, a large number of these individuals were white tenant farmers locked into a system which
                    made it nearly impossible to work their way up the agricultural ladder to land ownership. In common
                    with their neighbors to the north, they faced the problems of low prices for the goods they produced
                    and strong controls on their activities exercised by businesses and railroads. Thus, many of the
                    struggling farmers in the young state became interested in the speeches and writings of a small
                    group of men determined to show that socialism was the answer to such problems.</p>
            <p>According to Garin Burbank, one of the defining elements of the socialist movement in Oklahoma was
                    that there were two different views of what socialism was or should be. Editors and writers who were
                    at least to some degree attuned to the larger socialist effort tried to make clear the appeal of
                    socialism as an international philosophy that had meaning for both farmers and factory workers all
                    over the world. The Oklahoma farmer, says Burbank, took a more pragmatic view. He was looking for a
                    system that would help him achieve the two things he wanted most: higher prices for his produce and
                    the chance to own the land he worked. Restricted by the divergence of these two views, socialist
                    leaders appealed to the farmer by linking socialist philosophy to aspects of Oklahoma farm life in
                    the early twentieth century. Ministers preached the benefits of socialism from the pulpit and
                    likened its teachings to "the Protestant doctrine of equality in the sight of God"
                    (p. 22). Socialist advocates assured the farmer that the movement would not strive for social
                    equality for the Negro. Political leaders emphasized what could be accomplished by elected officials
                    who represented the needs of the rural populace instead of the desires of city folk who clung fast
                    to the two traditional parties.</p>
            <p>The activities of the socialists reached a peak in Oklahoma during the early 1910s, then declined
                    during World War I because farmers hesitated to support a movement that their peers considered
                    disloyal to the government. The war also <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-074-1-087"/> brought higher prices
                    for their produce, solving one of their most immediate problems. By the time the war ended, many of
                    the farmers had gone back to their previous political loyalties, and the Ku Klux Klan units
                    organized by hostile townsmen further encouraged them to reconsider their support of the socialist
                    movement.</p>
            <p>Burbank relied very heavily on newspapers, both pro- and anti-socialist, for his study of the period.
                    He notes that few documents left by early socialist leaders were available to him. Because of this,
                    the treatment of the subject on the whole is somewhat localized, and one wonders about the
                    relationship between socialists in Oklahoma and those in other parts of the country at the same
                    time. The appendixes contain a good selection of maps and tables showing voting patterns in the
                    state during the period 1910–1924, but very little reference to this material is made in
                    the text. Indeed, one feels that Bur-bank could have done a good deal more with voting statistics,
                    surely a more objective source than many of the newspapers. Finally, Burbank has done little to make
                    clear how socialism in Oklahoma fit into the larger picture of the farmer's attempt to
                    adjust himself and his goals to rapidly changing economic conditions in the early twentieth century.
                    Surely the socialists were not the only group to suggest farmers' cooperatives, for
                    example, but one learns almost nothing about how possible competition or conflicts of interests with
                    other farmers' organizations affected the success of the socialists.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Lucy Parsons: American Revolutionary.</hi> By Carolyn Ashbaugh. (Chicago: Charles H.
                    Kerr Publishing Company, for Illinois Labor History Society, 1976. Pp. 288. Illustrations, notes,
                    index. Clothbound, $10.00; paperbound, $3.95.)</head>
            <p>Lucy Parsons, widow of the Haymarket martyr Albert Parsons, was a radical activist who championed the
                    cause of the poor, worked toward raising working class consciousness, and fought for the free speech
                    movement. Her public career continued after her husband's death in 1887, and she worked
                    long and hard in print and on the platform for most left wing causes in the United States until her
                    death in 1942.</p>
            <p>While Ashbaugh's study is a useful contribution to the history of American radicalism, it is
                    not satisfying biography. <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-074-1-088"/> The author's enthusiastic
                    partisanship for Lucy Parsons results in uncritical acclaim, and hagiography is a disservice to
                    Parsons. Passion is best left to the victims of injustice whom Ashbaugh extensively quotes. The
                    reader expects more development of character than simple repetitions of the description of the
                    subject's mellifluous voice or her "piercing black eyes." Glimpses of the
                    harsh personal cost paid by Parsons in her efforts are only suggested: the violence and disorder in
                    her private life, her commital of her son to Illinois Northern Hospital for the Insane upon his
                    enlistment in the Spanish American War, and the death of her young daughter. The author does not
                    discuss what these tragedies reveal about her character nor how they affected her struggles with her
                    adversaries.</p>
            <p>Despite the handicap of the FBI's destruction of Parsons' papers and books after
                    her death, the author has mined the collateral sources extensively. One half the book carries
                    Lucy's life through her husband's execution in 1887. The second half narrates her
                    efforts in the divided radical movements thereafter, including the tensions among and within the
                    ranks of socialists, anarchists, syndicalists, the Industrial Workers of the World, and communists.
                    The strongest sections of the book are those that focus on the intermingling of radical activists
                    and causes. Ashbaugh uncritically takes Parsons' side in all the contests.</p>
            <p>Although Parsons, unlike her antagonist Emma Goldman, was inconsistent in some of her positions, she
                    offered a number of innovative ideas to the working class movement, including the
                    "sit-down" so successfully used by a later generation of strikers in the mass
                    production industries. Critics accused Parsons of joining any group with a revolutionary banner, but
                    Ashbaugh shows that she always kept the goal of the working class struggle in sharp focus at the
                    expense of ideological purity or party label.</p>
            <p>The book raises questions that either Ashbaugh at some later date or another biographer should
                    answer. How, for example, did Parsons survive in all those years of destitute poverty? Her wages as
                    a seamstress were surely inadequate to cover her expenses in travel and publicity for her causes.
                    And how was Lucy Parsons, a black woman, successful in rallying white male laborers at a time of
                    racist division among reformers and hoi polloi alike?</p>
            <p>The publisher is accountable for the careless proofing; for the sloppy printing job with double
                    images in the paperbound edition; and for the thoughtless titling of chapters in the table <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-074-1-089"/> of contents and the book when end notes are grouped by number
                    only. Despite her book's flaws, however, Ashbaugh has made a beginning toward examining the
                    life of this fighter for social justice.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Presidency of Warren G. Harding.</hi> By Eugene P. Trani and David L. Wilson.
                    (Lawrence: The Regents Press of Kansas, 1977. Pp. ix, 232. Frontispiece, notes, bibliographical
                    essay, index. $12.00.)</head>
            <p>The aim of the <hi rend="i">American Presidency Series</hi>, according to its editors, is to bring
                    together, synthesize, and draw conclusions from the best of the secondary literature on each
                    presidential administration. In the case of the Warren G. Harding presidency the number of secondary
                    accounts has grown enormously in recent years, reflecting both an increased availability of archival
                    materials and new perceptions of the period's significance. The need for a synthesis has
                    been great, and in this volume Eugene P. Trani and David L. Wilson go far toward providing one.
                    Their command of the literature is impressive, their synthesis of it thoughtful and effectively
                    presented, and their portrait of Harding's administration a balanced and generally
                    convincing one.</p>
            <p>On numerous matters Trani and Wilson accept the revisionism associated with Robert Murray, Andrew
                    Sinclair, and Randolph Downes. They conclude, for example, that the famous "smoke-filled
                    room" was more myth than reality, that Harding was a shrewd and effective politician, that
                    he was not personally involved in the scandals perpetrated during his term in office, and that he
                    did bring some highly capable men into his administration. They still conclude, however, that he and
                    his administration were failures. He was, so it is argued, a weak leader of questionable morals at a
                    time when the nation needed moral leadership. He had little understanding of the forces at work
                    during the period or of how government could be used for constructive purposes. And the Harding
                    administration's major achievements, depicted more as the work of Herbert Hoover, Charles
                    G. Dawes, and Henry C. Wallace than of the president himself, were essentially stop gap actions.
                    Despite the revisionism, the authors feel, Harding still deserves to rank near the bottom of
                    presidential polls.</p>
            <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-074-1-090"/>
            <p>Trani and Wilson also incorporate substantial elements of the revisionism associated with such
                    historians as Joan Hoff Wilson, Carl Parrini, Melvyn Leffler, Donald Winters, and Robert Zieger.
                    They note in particular the rise of a "corporate liberalism" and the way in which
                    this affected diplomatic developments, economic policy, and the organization building of the
                    departments of commerce and agriculture. What they make of this, however, is not entirely
                    satisfying, chiefly perhaps because they miss or have chosen to ignore much that these revisionists
                    have considered especially significant. There is little recognition, for example, of the divisions
                    or changes within business or of the administrative conflicts over what constituted desirable forms
                    of economic organization. Nor is there a recognition of the larger frameworks involved or the kinds
                    of historical continuities that the revisionists have stressed. On the contrary the images of
                    progressivism and the New Deal are essentially those found in the liberal history of the 1950s.</p>
            <p>The authors have not, in this reviewer's estimation, jettisoned enough of the old
                    progressive framework. But this disagreement aside, there is much to admire about the way that Trani
                    and Wilson have pulled together and synthesized recent scholarship. They have also provided an
                    excellent bibliographical essay, one that should be the starting point for those who would become
                    serious scholars of the Harding presidency.</p>

               <hi rend="i">A Valley Renewed: The History of the Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District.</hi>
                    By Hal Jenkins. (Kent, Ohio: The Kent State University Press, 1976. Pp. xii, 206. Illustrations,
                    appendixes, index. Clothbound, $11.00; paperbounhead, $5.75.)</head>
            <p>This book deals with the planning, financing, and implementation of solutions for the recurrent
                    problems of flooding and drought in the Muskingum River Valley of eastern Ohio. During the 1920s,
                    while memories of the devastating flood of 1913 were still fresh, business leaders of the region
                    formulated tentative plans for a water conservancy district. Their program for flood control and
                    water conservation through a series of dams and reservoirs drew heavily on the example of the Miami
                    Conservancy District, which had been planned by Arthur E. Morgan after the 1913 flood.</p>
            <p>Although reconciliation of conflicting interests within the Muskingum watershed proved difficult,
                    acquisition of funds <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-074-1-091"/> emerged as the major obstacle. Only after
                    the election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 could the Muskingum Valley business leaders
                    find the money to carry out their plans. During the early New Deal years the Muskingum Watershed
                    Conservancy District (MWCD) became a reality.</p>
            <p>With federal support came some hard lessons for the gentlemen from the Muskingum Valley. While the
                    government promised and ultimately delivered sufficient money for establishment of MWCD, federal
                    funds brought the government into planning and supervision of MWCD projects. Plans were altered, and
                    autonomy was compromised as the flood control program was turned over to the Army Corps of
                    Engineers. Conceived and planned as a local effort, MWCD thus became largely a federal undertaking.</p>
            <p>Acting more as editor than as author, Hal Jenkins has drastically condensed the late Dr. Roscoe
                    Eckelberry's annotated 1,500 page manuscript into "a manageable narrative for a
                    wider audience" (p. ix). With this larger readership in mind, Jenkins has deleted
                    "most of such academic trappings as footnotes and citations that are of little interest to
                    the general reader" (p. ix). The result is a straightforward narrative of the development
                    of MWCD, marred by numerous lengthy quotations from plans and reports and the lack of an analysis of
                    the importance of MWCD in the development of water resource legislation and programs. The general
                    reader's interest remains to be determined. For the historian the inclusion of the notes or
                    a bibliographic essay, coupled with some assessment of the significance of the MWCD enterprise,
                    would have increased the value of this volume. Readers interested in a more analytical approach
                    should consult Lyle E. Craine, "The Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District: A Study of
                    Local Control," <hi rend="i">Law &amp; Contemporary Problems</hi>, XXII (Summer, 1957).</p>

               <hi rend="i">Tomatoes Were Cheaper: Tales from the Thirties.</hi> By Charles A. Jellison. (New
                    York: Syracuse University Press, 1977. Pp. ix, 240. Note on sources. $10.95.)</head>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Tomatoes Were Cheaper</hi>, a treatment of America in the 1930s, is not a scholarly
                    monograph but rather an attempt "simply to recapture something of the flavor of American
                    life as it was during those years" (p. vii). The usual scholarly apparatus <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-074-1-092"/> is lacking. There is no documentation aside from a suggestive but
                    imprecise "Note on Sources." The choice of subjects is unusual. Only five of the
                    eleven chapters contain material one might expect in a standard survey of the decade: the impact of
                    the depression, the Bonus March, rejection of American membership in the World Court, Franklin D.
                    Roosevelt's reelection in 1936, and the Dies Committee's investigation of the
                    Federal Theatre Project. The other topics are unexpected: the disappearance of New York Judge Joseph
                    Crater, a lynching in California, Dizzy Dean and the gashouse gang, the notorious Brady gang, and
                    the rescue of a boy lost on a mountain in Maine.</p>
            <p>It would be easy to dismiss this book simply because it is not a standard historical survey.
                    Occasionally there are problems. It is not always easy to distinguish the author's views
                    from contemporary opinion. Does Jellison believe that communist subversion resulted from American
                    recognition of the Soviet Union (p. 161)? The absence of footnotes is keenly felt. The author seems
                    to accord Herbert Hoover greater prescience about the Depression than is justifiable (p. 6). At
                    times the emphasis seems misplaced. Jellison focuses on negative opinion of Roosevelt (pp.
                    153–68), and while this is ably done, it was Roosevelt's enormous popularity
                    which was more characteristic of the era. The subtitle is ambiguous; "tales"
                    connotes fiction. The value of even so informal a book could have been enhanced by an index.</p>
            <p>But these criticisms are minor. Jellison has indeed succeeded in recapturing "something of
                    the flavor" of American life during the 1930s. The result vindicates the method. The author
                    describes the astonishing diversity of the decade and the travail of ordinary Americans who, in
                    addition to pinching pennies and looking for work, also went to baseball games, read about
                    gangsters, cheered the recovery of a lost boy—and sometimes lynched kidnappers. Jellison
                    is an excellent writer who skillfully selected episodes capable of illuminating various aspects of
                    the 1930s. <hi rend="i">Tomatoes Were Cheaper</hi> is a memorable book resulting from literary
                    artistry successfully working on historical material. The book should make excellent supplementary
                    reading in American history courses and will be read with pleasure and profit by students and
                    general readers alike.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Fifties: The Way We Really Were.</hi> By Douglas T. Miller and Marion Nowak.
                    (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., 1977. Pp. 444. Notes, illustrations, selected
                    bibliography, index. $10.95.)</head>
            <p>In the wake of Vietnam, Watergate, and other disruptions of the late 1960s and early 1970s, a
                    nostalgic view of the 1950s has emerged. The prevailing notion is of an era of innocence and
                    simplicity untarnished by the fear and violence of the ensuing years. Miller and Nowak, in a
                    thorough and evocative social history of the decade, take issue with this perception. They argue
                    persuasively that the pleasant image of the 1950s can better be described as tired, dull, cautious,
                    and anxious. In their opinion the search for security through conformity was the essence of the
                    decade.</p>
            <p>A number of factors contributed to this conclusion. Of these, none was more important than the Cold
                    War and its accompanying anticommunism, which the authors see as only the latest manifestation of
                    the nation's deep rooted antiradicalism. Thus, Senator Joseph McCarthy did not create the
                    hysterical fear of a red menace; rather, he capitalized on it. What is most significant, however, is
                    that the impact of anticommunism, far from disappearing with the demise of McCarthy, was felt
                    throughout the decade in a number of ways. Anticommunism caused or affected the search for security,
                    the return to religion, the celebration of family, the absence of an effective left, the disunity of
                    labor unions, the quietness of college students, the widespread political apathy, the arms race, and
                    the reliance on nuclear superiority.</p>
            <p>Later chapters expand on these and other important characteristics of the decade, including the use
                    of massive advertising, credit buying, and planned obsolescence to stimulate high levels of
                    consumption, the growth of suburbia (the natural habitat of organization men and their ideal
                    helpmates), the impact of the automobile, the intimidation of women (especially those with
                    aspirations toward education or work), the failure to face realistically the problems of
                    America's minorities, the unwillingness of most intellectuals to criticize the world in
                    which they lived, and the attack on progressive education. While these themes and many others are
                    presented with skill and grace, Miller and Nowak are at their best in dealing with the music,
                    movies, and television of the 1950s. From Johnny Ray, through Alan Freed, to Bill Haley and the
                    Comets and Elvis ("Had Sam Phillips not discovered Elvis Presley in Memphis, it would have
                    been necessary to invent him." [p. 300]), the <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-074-1-094"/> authors
                    trace the evolution of rock and roll from a suspect genre favored by black artists to its
                    domestication as symbolized by the success of American Bandstand. In a similar fashion Miller and
                    Nowak describe the development of the television industry and its programming during the decade.
                    They conclude sadly that the quality of the latter, at least in terms of originality and creativity,
                    declined during the 1950s in part because the real point of the medium became not entertainment but
                    the commercial pitch. Thus, television's vast potential disappeared as Milton Berle was
                    replaced as Mr. Television by a corporation executive.</p>
            <p>Miller and Nowak have written a fascinating and thought provoking book. Their research, which ranges
                    from scholarly journals to comic books and from intellectual treatises to the late show, is
                    impressive, and they use anecdotal material well. They do not hesitate to take advantage of their
                    own personal experiences with the decade, which adds an additional degree of legitimacy to the
                    result. At times they try to force events or facts to conform to those characteristics of the decade
                    already identified as significant. But this is a minor concern. <hi rend="i">The Fifties</hi> is
                    intellectually sound, well written, and a most pleasant guide through ten years of American history
                    which well deserve the skeptical and serious treatment that this book provides.</p>

            <p>It appears that the intention of the promoters of the bicentennial meeting at the National
                    Agricultural Library in Beltsville, Maryland, was to focus "upon the historical as well as
                    the continual importance of American agricultural literature" (p. 1), but few of the
                    twenty-seven participants had much to say on the subject; some never even mentioned it. Only one
                    paper, "Agriculture with Hoof and Horn: An Analysis of the Historical Literature of the
                    Cattle Industry," by Walter Run-dell, Jr., and Anne M. Butler, is thoroughly satisfactory,
                    and it is restricted to developments on the Great Plains. Another <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-074-1-095"/> useful paper, "Horticultural Heritage," by Elisabeth Woodburn, describes in
                    detail the publications of early nurserymen. Some of the other papers relate in a limited way to the
                    announced theme, including those on agricultural libraries, historical research in agricultural
                    colleges, and the editors of some leading farm magazines. A few of the contributors reveal in the
                    footnotes to their papers that they are conversant with the leading publications in their fields of
                    interest and make suggestions as to future research. Scattered throughout the papers and
                    commentaries are other ideas which might prove useful. But the coverage of the entire subject is
                    patchy in the extreme. Thus there is no significant mention of any writings on the agriculture of
                    Indiana, or Ohio, or Kentucky, or Illinois, or indeed of the Corn Belt.</p>
            <p>The published proceedings of the symposium will be very disappointing to any student who expects
                    evaluations of at least the major writings in the field—general works like Percy W.

                    and animal breeding and weed and pest control; the history of the work of the agricultural colleges
                    and the experimental stations; and the development of farm organizations. The student might also
                    anticipate that there would be some analysis of the sources, not only travel accounts and farm
                    journals, but the publications of the federal government from the days of the Patent Office reports
                    to the yearbooks of the Department of Agriculture and the tremendous collective output of the state
                    boards of agriculture or departments of agriculture. There would be a legitimate place for farm life
                    and the problems of farming as seen by novelists. There might reasonably be some consideration of
                    what areas are most in need of study, what sources have as yet been underexploited, and what new
                    techniques might be used.</p>
            <p>One reason for the failure of the symposium to emphasize the literature of American agriculture was
                    that the participants were a miscellaneous aggregation of "book dealers, <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-074-1-096"/> editors, folklorists, geographers, historians, librarians, scientists,
                    and others" (p. 2). Some of these had little knowledge of the development of American
                    farming and of course were without any research experience in the announced subject. It is also
                    obvious that no effort whatever was made to enforce a rule of relevance. One paper incorporates the
                    observations of a recent visitor to Communist China on farming there; another describes the rural
                    medical program of the Rockefeller Foundation in West Africa and Mexico; and another paper and its
                    accompanying commentary deal with the problem of famine in India and China.</p>
            <p>The conference on the whole exemplified the characteristic weaknesses of such efforts. While some of
                    the papers might be classified as specialized articles which could find a place in a journal like
                        <hi rend="i">Agricultural History</hi>, others were really occasional pieces which could never
                    achieve publication except as part of the proceedings of a program. Of the symposia sponsored by the
                    Agricultural History Society in the last half dozen years, that of September, 1975, will be the one
                    least noted and remembered.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Traditions of American Education.</hi> By Lawrence A. Cremin. (New York: Basic Books,
                    Inc., 1977. Pp. ix, 172. Notes, index. $8.95.)</head>
            <p>This book, consisting of lectures given by Cremin at the University of Wisconsin to inaugurate the
                    Merle Curti Lectures, highlights aspects of his three volume study of the history of American
                    education. The themes of the addresses are the successful transformation and modification of
                    European educational institutions during the colonial period (1607–1783), the
                    "development of an authentic American vernacular in education" during the national
                    period (1783–1876), and the "transformation and proliferation of American
                    educational agencies" during the metropolitan period (1876–1976) (p. viii).
                    Defining education broadly as "the deliberate, systematic, and sustained effort to
                    transmit, evoke or acquire knowledge, attitudes, values, skills or sensibilities, as well as any
                    outcomes of that effort" (p. viii), Cremin proceeds to examine diverse educational
                    influences, although he does not always make clear in what ways these influences were and were not
                    "deliberate, systematic and sustained" efforts to education. Nevertheless, his
                    scope is significant as he looks at such diverse educational influences <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-074-1-097"/> as the family and peer group, plantation and factory, school and army,
                    church and social settlement, library and newspaper, chautauqua and mass media, museum and prison,
                    cinema and circus.</p>
            <p>In this work Cremin makes a plea for understanding the complexity of historical events. Although his
                    conclusions parallel his earlier work, i.e., that schools and education promoted freedom, equality,
                    and social mobility, he arrives at them through a more complex analysis that takes more factors into
                    account. Cremin demonstrates that he has benefited from the clash between liberal educational
                    historians, Cremin being a par excellence representative, and radical revisionist historians. In
                    part, the complexity of Cremin's account is attributable to revisionist criticism; at the
                    same time he poses new challenges for those revisionists.</p>
            <p>The core of much of the revisionist attack has been that education, and schooling in particular, has
                    played an important role in legitimating the social order, in promoting social control. While Cremin
                    does not examine the historical materials that support the revisionist interpretation (and thus some
                    revisionists may view his efforts as an attempt to quiet or appease them), nevertheless he does
                    enter the dialogue on the question of social control. In discussing literacy, for example, he notes
                    that literacy simultaneously systematizes and individualizes experience. He observes that to
                    "the extent literacy rationalizes experience, it can and often does strengthen the power of
                    extant educative institutions" (p. 34). At the same time he notes that the outcomes of
                    schooling are contradictory. For schooling "never liberates without at the same time
                    limiting …. It never frees without at the same time socializing. The question is not
                    whether one or the other is occurring in isolation but what the balance is, and to what end, and in
                    light of what alternatives" (p. 37). On balance, Cremin views schooling and education as
                    liberating, although he essentially asserts rather than demonstrates his position. He thus
                    unmistakably challenges revisionists to expand their scope and examine diverse educational
                    influences to determine if they did liberate, did indeed provide genuine options and possibilities.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Collection, Use, and Care of Historical Photographs.</hi> By Robert A. Weinstein and
                    Larry Booth. (Nashville: American Association for State and Local History, 1977. Pp. 222.
                    Illustrations, appendixes, suggested reading, index. $16.00.)</head>
            <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-074-1-098"/>
            <p>Observing the difference in treatment accorded a hundred year old painting and a photograph of the
                    same vintage, Weinstein and Booth begin their volume with an overview of the history of photography,
                    including many definitions necessary for distinguishing among the various photographic techniques
                    and products. The authors, a printing executive and a photographic collection curator, stress the
                    importance of historical photographs by touching upon historical, educational, and commercial use of
                    them. They further suggest methods of making photograph collections available to researchers through
                    responsible cataloging.</p>
            <p>In the field of collecting, Weinstein and Booth provide a case study to which staff members of any
                    size library or museum can relate concerning considerations to make before, during, and after the
                    collecting process has been set into motion. Their example includes questions of legality in
                    transferring, and reproducing photographs from, a newly acquired collection, initial sorting and
                    cataloging, and suggestions for pursuing new acquisitions.</p>
            <p>The arrangement of this book complies with one of the messages preached in the text: the need for
                    caution against rushing into conservation methods without having some impression of the chemistry of
                    photography and more than a little appreciation for the photograph as historical record. Thus, Part
                    Two, containing a technical view of photograph conservation, follows eighty-six pages of remarks
                    approaching the status of a full blown philosophy, the bulk of Part One's 119 pages. The
                    authors present their views as to why historical photographs are an essential historical record and
                    why, therefore, they should be preserved and made available to researchers. The text is spiced with
                    many narratives of the authors' own experiences and observations regarding practices at
                    several depositories that they visited.</p>
            <p>The reader is then introduced to the mission and the method of photograph conservation, being led
                    into a succeedingly more detailed explanation of the techniques and procedures for caring for the
                    collection. Part Two begins with a discussion of the essential considerations in the protection of a
                    collection: temperature, humidity and other atmospheric conditions of the storage area, separation
                    of nitrate base film from all other items, care of negatives, care of original prints,
                    identification of items in need of special care and consideration, and storage furniture and
                    supplies. The next chapter, begun with the caveat that most restoration must be done by a trained
                    conservator, treats in forty-three pages suggestions for <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-074-1-099"/> the
                    restoration of photographic materials. These suggestions are arranged by type of photograph, thereby
                    expanding upon the capsule history of photography given earlier. Modern photography is not forgotten
                    and is dealt with briefly, particularly those aspects of production which differ from historical
                    methods and products.</p>
            <p>The final section of the book contains useful though brief appendixes giving information about
                    authorities and publications deemed necessary to the awareness of the librarian/ curator, sources of
                    supplies for conservation, a columnar identification guide to photographic materials and techniques,
                    five pages of suggested readings, and an adequate index. The book should include a glossary of
                    elementary photographic terms in order to make it the complete first book for the person charged
                    with responsibility for a photograph collection in a library or museum which has no conservator on
                    the staff. Parts of the book may also serve as required reading for those who have occasion to
                    handle historical photographs. Overall, the message of appreciation and care for the
                    photographers' art over the 137 year old history of the craft proceeds without serious
                    obstacles to ease of reading and comprehension. As one can rightfully expect, the book is well
                    illustrated with fine examples of photography that are presented for instructional use as well as
                    for visual appreciation. In summary, Weinstein and Booth have compiled an important book for
                    librarians or museum curators who are newcomers to the gamut—or any single
                    aspect—of collecting, utilizing, and preserving historical photographs.</p>

                    David Rohrer Leeper. (South Bend, Ind., 1894; reprinted, South Bend: Northern Indiana Historical
                    Society, 1977. Pp. 146, xvi. Illustrations, notes, appendix. $10.40.) Like so many others
                    in 1849, David R. Leeper was excited by the news of gold in California. His adventures as a
                    forty-niner remained vivid many decades later; yet, the greatest appeal of his memoirs lies in
                    Leeper's account of the real West, so different from the Hollywood version. He saw only a
                    dozen buffalo while crossing the plains and wandered away from the wagon train entirely unarmed.
                    Dust and thirst were greater worries than Indians. After eight months Leeper reached Sacramento,
                    tired and dead broke. He found little gold and soon learned a new refrain: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    from Cincinnati to present day Toledo figured prominently in General Anthony Wayne's Indian
                    campaigns of the early 1790s. This publication summarizes the location, construction, history, and
                    features of each fort. Contemporary plans and drawings illustrate the wide variety of construction
                    techniques that Wayne utilized. Indiana residents will be most interested in Fort Wayne, the only

                    36. Illustrations, notes, appendixes. Booklet, $.75.) This pamphlet summarizes available
                    evidence on the lives of women, white and Indian, at Fort Wayne or in its vicinity prior to the War
                    of 1812. While some women worked as nurses or laundresses, most were on the frontier with their
                    husbands. The publication is enhanced because much of the primary documentation is quoted
                    extensively in the text and appendixes. It is marred by several modern drawings of dubious quality
                    which add nothing to the story. <hi rend="i">Roger G. Miller, Indiana University, Bloomington.</hi>

                    Robert R. Madden and T. Russell Jones. (Washington: National Park Service, U.S. Department of the
                    Interior, 1977. Pp. vii, 55. Illustrations, figures. Paperbound, $1.90.) Old traditional
                    ways of life persist into the post-industrial era in a variety of ways. In the case of the Walker
                    family a combination of geographical isolation and personal preference was responsible for
                    perpetuating a remarkable complex of early patterns until after World War II. Six Walker sisters who
                    never married lived in the isolated family homestead, clinging to the ways of their parents, even
                    though their home and land was engulfed by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The last sister
                    died in 1964, and now the Walker farm is to function eventually as a museum. As such, it will be
                    remarkably well documented. The authors of this booklet and others have been able to assemble
                    detailed information of many kinds about the sisters, their home, and their farm. Through family
                    photographs, interviews with the sisters and their relatives, and other sources, the authors are
                    able to present a detailed and multifaceted picture of a largely self sufficient way of life. This
                    is a unique and valuable document. The authors are to be congratulated and the National Park Service
                    to be thanked for making it available. <hi rend="i">Warren E. Roberts, Indiana University,

                    Edited by Herbert Weaver; associate editor, Wayne Cutler. (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press,
                    1977. Pp. xxxvi, 692. End maps, frontispiece, notes, index. $25.00.) Anyone who has read
                    parts of the usually dreary Polk diary (as this reviewer did in more halcyon days) would approach
                    this volume with some trepidation. While the 667 pages of correspondence represent two eventful
                    years in Folk's life—including the Panic of <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-074-1-102"/>
                    1837, a second term as House speaker, one brother's expulsion from Yale, and
                    another's murder of a man—less than one sixth of the letters are from the future
                    president. The Tennessean still only occasionally comes alive to historians (chiefly in
                    correspondence with brother Samuel), and the reader's lasting impression is Folk's
                    strong faith in the people: "they are sound to the core" (p. 129). If the man
                    remains still in shadows, that is due to the scarcity of letters, for the editors have done an
                    excellent job. The quality of Wayne Cutler's work makes it evident that retiring editor
                    Herbert Weaver has left Polk in very capable hands. <hi rend="i">James C. Klotter, Kentucky

                        Practices.</hi> Compiled by Rosemary S. Reese. Edited by Frederick L. Rath, Jr., and Merrilyn
                    Rogers O'Connell. (Nashville: American Association for State and Local History, 1977. Pp.
                    viii, 107. Appendix, index. Clothbound, $10.00; paperbound, $7.50.) This book
                    should appeal to a wide range of people interested in conservation and preservation. It is a well
                    organized, very complete bibliography that includes both general and very technical materials. There
                    are also special sections on conservation organizations, training, and ethics that ought to be very
                    useful to anyone trying to develop a new conservation program. Although bibliographies in this field
                    do become dated quickly, this one contains so much of the current literature that it should be
                    useful for many years. The book belongs on the reference shelf of anyone concerned with the care of
                    historical collections. <hi rend="i">Pamela M. Najar, Indiana Historical Society, Indianapolis.</hi>

                    Elliott. (New Harmony, Ind.: Raintree Books, 1976. Pp. 39. Illustrations. Booklet,
                    $2.50.) "The New Harmony Fourth of July tradition extends from 1815 to the
                    present. The tradition was begun by the Harmonist founders of the town, was continued by the
                    Owenites after 1825, and, with but few lapses, has been perpetuated to the present. The record of
                    the events has been preserved in an almost unbroken sequence of newspapers from the New-Harmony <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> to the New Harmony <hi rend="i">Times</hi>" (p. 5). From these
                    newspapers Donald E. Pitzer and Josephine M. Elliott have chosen for verbatim reproduction three
                    representative addresses which were delivered at New <pb n="99" id="VAA4025-074-1-103"/> Harmony in
                    1826, 1827, and 1828. Brief introductions describe both the orators and the content of the speeches.
                    Also included in the booklet are a series of most interesting illustrations, drawn by Charles
                    Alexandre Lesueur about 1832, which depict the typical New Harmony barbecue, picnic, and
                    parade—events which were frequently part of the fourth of July festivities. This
                    publication can be purchased from Raintree Books, Box 175, New Harmony, Indiana. <hi rend="i">Lorna

               <hi rend="i">Sidelights of Early Evansville History.</hi> By Daniel W. Snepp. Revised edition.
                    (Evansville, Ind.: the author, 1976. Pp. 77. Illustrations, table, map. Booklet, $3.50.)
                    Included in this booklet are eight stories—each one a unit and independent of the
                    others—describing various aspects of the early history of Evansville, Indiana. Four of
                    the chapters are economic in nature and contain material on steamboating, the railroad builders, and
                    the Wabash and Erie Canal; three stories relate to the Civil War period; and one details information
                    about Evansville's founding fathers. The product of many years of research on local
                    history, this work will be of interest to libraries, schools, and individuals interested in the
                    history of early Evansville. Copies can be obtained from Daniel W. Snepp, 2323 East Mulberry Street,

               <hi rend="i">Indiana Covered Bridges thru the Years.</hi> By George E. Gould. (Indianapolis: Indiana
                    Covered Bridge Society, Inc., 1977. Pp. 64. Illustrations, appendix, selected bibliography, map.
                    Booklet, $4.50.) During the period from 1820 to 1922 approximately six hundred covered
                    bridges were built throughout Indiana; in 1977 only 102 were still standing. In this study George E.
                    Gould attempts "to bring together all the information now available" on covered
                    bridges in the Hoosier state (p. 3). Particularly interesting are the brief biographies of a few of
                    the more than eighty people who are credited with building covered bridges in Indiana. A chapter
                    explaining the terminology and science of bridge building is most helpful. Also included is a
                    section which describes in some detail the distribution of covered bridges by counties. In an
                    appendix a summary chart lists the name, stream spanned, location, type of truss, builder, length,
                    and years in existence of each of Indiana's covered bridges. This publication can be
                    purchased from the Indiana Covered Bridge Society, Inc., 825 Sanders Street, Indianapolis, Indiana

               <hi rend="i">The Iron Brigade: A Military History.</hi> By Alan T. Nolan. Second Edition. (Madison:
                    The State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1975. Pp. xii, 412. Maps, illustrations, appendixes,
                    notes, selected bibliography, index. $12.00.) <hi rend="i">The Iron Brigade</hi> is the
                    story of the only all western brigade in the Union Army of the Potomac. Initially composed of the
                    Second, Sixth, and Seventh Wisconsin and the Nineteenth Indiana volunteers, it was later, because of
                    depleted numbers, reinforced by the Twenty-Fourth Michigan. Nolan follows the brigade through Second
                    Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville to Gettysburg, where the unit suffered so
                    many casualties that eastern reinforcements caused it to lose its regional identity. In 1961, when
                    the book was originally published, T. Harry Williams described it as "unit history writing
                    at its best" (<hi rend="i">Military History</hi>, XXV, 106). In the foreward to the present
                    edition he writes: the Iron Brigade was "probably the best fighting brigade in the
                    army" (p. viii). The combination of these two facts makes the reissue of this volume a most
                    praiseworthy contribution to the military history of the Civil War. <hi rend="i">Lorna Lutes

            <p>The Indiana Historical Society has instituted sessions at its November annual meeting for the
                    presentation of scholarly papers in Indiana or midwestern history. In 1977 there were sessions in
                    economic and political history with six papers being presented. In order to begin planning for next
                    year's program, the historical society is inviting interested historians, including
                    students, to submit proposals for papers to be presented at the 1978 annual meeting. The deadline
                    for submission is June 15, 1978.</p>

                    now considering the publication of a companion volume that would examine the lives and careers of
                    other Indiana political figures, including elected and appointed officials and party functionaries.
                    Persons who have undertaken research concerned with such individuals (or who might be interested in
                    doing so) are encouraged to write the Director, Indiana Historical Bureau, 140 North Senate,
