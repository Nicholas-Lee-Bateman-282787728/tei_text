            <head>Indiana's Reaction to the Submarine Controversy of 1915</head>
            <byline>CEDRIC C. CUMMINS</byline>
            <p>The year 1915 was crucial in American relations with the World War belligerents. Under the hard
                    impact of that year's unescapable developments, the nation formulated its policy toward
                    English and German violations of American sea rights-a policy which was to constitute one of the
                    major causes of war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>. It is the purpose of this study to trace the evolution of that policy in a fairly
                    typical state.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The year opened with a debate on the propriety of American munition sales to the fighting nations,
                    centering upon the embargo resolution which the German-American member, Richard Bartholdt, had
                    introduced in Congress. In Indiana, German sympathizers took the lead in the campaign, and
                    throughout the early months of 1915 they pushed the drive with vigor and near-desperation. If they
                    had known that they must succeed or fail before the "Lusitania" had made a few more crossings, they
                    would have worked even more frantically.</p>
            <p>Indiana congressmen were showered with letters, telegrams, and resolutions threatening political
                    retaliation for adverse votes, while the general public was pursued by means of editorials,
                    "Letters to the Editor," pamphlets, and public meetings.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                    Irish and German efforts were pooled, and under the name of the American Neutrality League they held

                    prominently bedecked with the American flag, speakers at these gatherings argued for a stoppage of
                    the arms traffic on the grounds of "real neutrality" and Christianity and predicted that such action
                    would bring a cessation of war "in 90 days." Responsibility for the unholy sales was placed
                    on the triumvirate of munition makers, "shylocks of high finance," and "Tory
                    newspapers." Sarcastic references were made to "kind Uncle Sam" who talked of neutrality
                    but handed a blackjack to one set of belligerents, and who dispatched nurses and medicine to bind up
                    the wounds of Europe and at the same time sent guns to inflict more wounds. The audience cheered
                    proposals for the establishment of a "higher and better international law" and hissed references to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, J. P. Morgan, the DuPonts, and Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan-strange
                    company for "The Commoner"! At the close of the session, a previously prepared resolution was read,
                    unanimously adopted, and forwarded to the local editors and congressmen.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    </placeName> and Mennonite, the Socialists, and other positive pacifists gave added support to the
                    crusade, and from the evangelistic rural and small town sections came a scattering of passive
                        approval.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Unmistakably, however, the greater part of the public was opposed
                    to an arms embargo, for whether they came out squarely against it with ringing declarations or
                    simply stood aside from all pro-embargo activity, the result was a vote against a change in existing
                    policy. For one thing, the dominant role played by the pro-Germans caused the embargo movement to be
                    associated, not with neutrality, but its opposite. The public knew that if stopping munition <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>. That, most of them did not want. Furthermore, it was pointed out that the right of
                    private citizens of a neutral country to sell munitions to belligerents was a long-accepted
                    principle of international law-subject only to rules governing blockade and contraband-and a
                    principle for which the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> had many times contended.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> An abrupt change of that rule in the
                    midst of war would be an unneutral act that would withhold from the Allied powers rights belonging
                    to them under international law.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> "It is the business of a belligerent operating
                    on the high seas, not the duty of a neutral, to prevent contraband from reaching an enemy,"
                    and it would be "an act of partiality on the part of this government" to "equalize the difference
                    due to the relative naval strength of the belligerents," ran a much-quoted expression of
                        opinion.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> It was further contended that instead of promoting peace, an
                    embargo would place a premium on militarism by necessitating the accumulation in time of peace of
                    great stores of fighting equipment. Since the <placeName>

                    prevent it from buying needed war stocks abroad when at war was labeled "highly
                        unpatriotic."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> In addition, and with emphasis, opposition to the
                    embargo was placed on the basis that its adoption would "shut down many of our largest factories"

            <p>Meanwhile, American commerce on the Atlantic was being buffeted by Allied efforts to blockade the

                    spectacular incidents caused public opinion to crystalize slowly and irregularly. Under those
                    circumstances, perhaps the most fruitful method of tracing the reactions of the Hoosiers through the

            <p>The next development to catch the editorial eye was the controversy over the "Dacia," a

                    threat to seize the "Dacia" as an argument against the pending ship-purchase bill. For, he reasoned,
                    if the government bought interned German ships and the Allies confiscated them when they appeared on
                    the ocean, it would create a "grave risk of becoming involved in the European war."<hi rend="sup">14</hi> The following day he took up a discussion of the "Dacia" case on its own

                    will determine its status. He did not appear to be excessively concerned as to which way the
                    decision would go, for like most of the public, he regarded the issue primarily as one between <placeName>

            <p>March 1 was greeted with a new British Order in Council which further tightened the Allied blockade

                    </placeName> and by placing food on the contraband list. "We should speak to the Allies in terms as

                    "what recourse we shall have if our protests are ignored rests in the future. For the

                    that the British order went into effect news came of another event which overshadowed and nullified
                    it as far as public opinion was concerned. For on March 11 the German cruiser, "Prinz Eitel

            <p>Having come to the eve of the "Lusitania" sinking, one is inclined to look back over the road with
                    some puzzlement and to inquire as to just what was the attitude of this editor and the public during
                    those months. Inattention and indecision seemed almost to outweigh the more positive reactions, and
                    practically all of the newspapers displayed more interest in Mexico, the ship-purchase bill, and
                    politics than in the great war. There were week-long stretches when the smaller dailies made only
                    the most cursory references to the war. Yet, one thing was clear enough. As long as no irremediable
                    injury was done, <hi rend="i">i.e.,</hi> loss of life, or national animosities aroused, there would
                    be but little excitement over a "matter such as the stoppage of ships." This applied to
                    German action as well as English, for so clear cut a violation of law and comity as the destruction
                    of the "William P. Frye" raised no war sentiments. The public did not even object very strenuously
                    to <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>'s submarine order-as long as it was not enforced in a manner detrimental to

            <p>This possibility became a reality when on May 7, 1915, the "Lusitania," pride of the English
                    Cunard Line, was torpedoed and sunk without warning near the Irish coast with nearly 2,000
                    passengers and crew aboard. On that initial day, however, the Indiana public found but little
                    positive information in their newspapers. They read (usually for the first time) of the warning that

                    in the casualty list caught the public eye: author Elbert Hubbard, wealthy Alfred G. Vanderbilt who
                    perished after surrendering his life preserver to a woman, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName> producer Charles Frohman whose half-smiling acquiescence in death as the "most
                    beautiful adventure of life" constituted the perfect exit.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Piteous stories
                    were recounted. Two children "were brought ashore clasped in each other's arms." A
                    mother, half crazed by her experiences, who was pulled from the sea with a dead infant in her arms,
                    "looked for a moment at the child's face and then said, 'Let me bury my baby' at

                    sprang up, grew, and multiplied like endlessly dividing cells. Sunday night and throughout Monday

                        agent.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Clearly this sinking was not to be as casually regarded as had
                    those that had preceded it. The fact that 124 of the dead who lay along the Irish shore or remained
                    undiscovered in the nearby Atlantic were citizens of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> had made the tragedy an American one, bringing the "European War" home to the American
                    public. The subjects of politics and Mexico were shoved aside, and the weekly newspapers took up a

                    obligation of providing for the relative safety of the crew and passengers. But in this case
                    American citizens had gone to their death because the latter had been ignored, and upon that ground

                    better reflection of the various facets of the public mood at this stage could be found in the
                    events of May 18, which earlier had been designated National Peace Day. The sincere prayers that the <placeName>

                    of peace.<hi rend="sup">71</hi> The excessive emphasis which the newspapers of that same day gave to
                    the President's grand review of the American war fleet denoted the heightened nationalism

                    this blow constituted the awaited answer. On May 29, 1915, however, such speculation was brought to
                    an end by receipt of the official German reply. Because it ignored most of the points of American
                    protest, it was regarded as "evasive"; and because it argued German justification on the ground that
                    the "Lusitania" was an armed British auxilliary warship, it was characterized as an
                    "insult." No proof of this was given and American port officials, the State Department, and
                    survivors swore to the contrary. "Worth <list type="footnotes">

                    Circumstances, past and present, conspired to make him almost championless. Sensitive of the fact
                    that only Republican disunity in 1912 had enabled them to elect their second President since the
                    Civil War, the Democrats felt that Bryan had let them down by inviting disharmony in their own
                    ranks. To the Republicans, the three-times candidate for President had become the symbol of their
                    partisan enemy, and their journals which had lashed him for years with charges of Populism, cheap
                    money, free trade, and lack of "red-blooded" patriotism hastened to cite this new deed as crowning
                    proof of his rascality. Patriots compared him to Judas Iscariot, Benedict Arnold, and Clement L.
                    Vallandigham. Conservatives reviewed his economic heresies. Practically all expressed the fear that

            <p>Such support as the battered Bryan received came chiefly from three sources. Quakers and other

                    protector of the party in those long, lean years when it wandered in the wilderness of defeat and
                    was therefore to be regarded as more than just another of the many recent unsuccessful Democratic

            <p>Amidst the sound and fury of the assaults on the ex-Secretary of State, the people of Indiana gave
                    little attention to his proposals that (1) the President should warn Americans against traveling on
                    belligerent ships, (2) prevent American vessels from carrying munitions, and (3) arbitrate the
                    dispute with <placeName>

                    </placeName> after the fashion provided in the cooling off treaties. Undoubtedly much of the
                    previous sentiment favorable to these ideas remained in the Middle West. But due to the growing
                    impatience toward <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, the unwillingness to strengthen the impression of national disunity, the compulsion
                    felt by the Democrats to hold up the hands of Wilson, and the congenital inability of the
                    Republicans to agree with Bryan, little attention was paid to them at this point. Moreover, there
                    was to be in some quarters a future tendency to associate such proposals with "peace-at-any-price"
                    and pro-German doctrines.</p>
            <p>Under the circumstances, Flag Day, June 14, and Independence Day took on special importance this
                    year. On the former occasion patriotic paraders, with "Old Glory" to front and rear, trudged through
                    the streets of a number of cities under the sponsorship of the local Elks Lodge.92 Sunday, July 4,
                    was designated Americanization Day and dedicated to a "rebaptism of patriotism" for "Americans by
                    birth and Americans by choice." Special services were held in the churches, at which war
                    veterans occupied reserved seats, patriotic songs were lustily rendered, and the clergy thanked God
                    for America.<hi rend="sup">93</hi> Of the holiday motorists who thronged the roads, "it was

                            from the beginning of the war that a German victory would endanger America. Instinctively,
                            many of the less vocal Hoosiers seem to have felt likewise–how many, it is
                            impossible to say. As far as this group was concerned, American foreign policy of 1915 was
                            not so much a cause of eventual war as it was an immediate entry into the conflict.</item>

                    martial conflict with the more popular Allies over property losses suffered by American exporting

                    case against the Allies in 1915 without compensation.<hi rend="sup">103</hi> Perhaps it did. But it
                    is clear that their government was doing all that the public wanted done with regard to Allied sea
                    action. Public and President, apparently, traveled the same road to the same conclusions.</p>
            <p>In any event, the headline news of August 20, 1915, "Liner Arabic Finds Grave Alongside

                    the background as State Department and public wearily took up again the threads of submarine
                    diplomacy. The situation was all the more acute because this time there could be no excuse on the
                    ground that the Americans were on a munition-laden ship, for as editor after editor pointed out the
                    "Arabic" was westward bound and its American passengers on their way home.<hi rend="sup">105</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the whole, however, the tragedy seems to have been received with more regret than anger-regret
                    that the diplomatic calm had been broken and another wrangle was at hand. It was characteristic of
                    those days that, though they were far less emotionally moved than they had been by the "Lusitania"
                    tragedy, the people would have been more willing for their government to have severed diplomatic

                    the part of public and government by the dispatch with which they hastened to apply diplomatic

                    for the loss of life, and more important, announced that the sinking was contrary to the intentions
                    of the German government. Foreign Minister von Jagow matched this with a conciliatory pronouncement
                    from Berlin, and a few days later, September 1, von Bernstorff put in writing the solemn pledge that

                    the "Persia" were torpedoed and sunk with loss of American lives in the closing months of the year.
                    Though not one of these developments was considered of primary importance, together they provided
                    enough friction to keep alive a sense of irritation among the public. One citizen fumed after the

                    And though the year ended in comparative calm, irretraceable steps had been taken in public opinion.
                    The people would never quite cease to view the European strife through the portholes of the
                    "Lusitania" and "Arabic," particularly the former. The humanitarian antipathy toward <placeName>

                    </placeName> previously held by a majority of the citizens had been deepened. Of far greater
                    significance, a nationalistic antagonism had been added. Preparedness sentiment had arisen sharply.
                    The victory had strengthened the public's belief in the rightness of the American position
                    and had set their feet on a road from which they could turn back with only the greatest difficulty,
                    for having won through on these issues once, it would prove almost impossible to back down when the
                    same or similar disputes arose in the future. The number of those who were pro-Ally probably had not
                    been appreciably increased, for the pro-Germans and Anglophobes remained unconvinced. <list type="footnotes">

                    the administration's handling of the submarine issue had reflected the sentiments of the
                    people with singular accuracy.</p>
            <p>The next spring, 1916, a new diplomatic crisis arose when the Germans torpedoed the Allied
                    merchantman "Sussex" in violation of the promise of September 1, seriously injuring several
                    Americans. The German pledge of May 4 to abide by the rules of cruiser warfare ended the impasse and
                    marked the beginning of a several months' period of improved relations with the <placeName>

                    government began a desperate attempt to cut the Allied life lines by unrestricted submarine warfare,
                    sinking neutral as well as belligerent vessels. When in March a number of unarmed American ships
                    were destroyed without warning, the country was confronted with the alternatives of withdrawing its
                    shipping from the north Atlantic for the duration of the conflict or going to war to defend it. For

                    obscurity. He wrote that his early desire to become a painter was strongly opposed by his parents,
                    who, as a compromise, had apprenticed him in 1843 to a wood engraver. This apprenticeship lasted
                    until 1852.</p>
            <p>During the last two or three years of the apprenticeship, he studied painting and crayon portraiture
                    and spent some time as a student at the National Academy of Design. In 1852 he went to <placeName>

                            falling at the start and continued day in and day out until the roads were so muddy that it
                            was almost impossible to travel. Many of the men left their shoes sticking in the mud, and
                            often they themselves had to be hauled out of the mud by their comrades. The artillery stuck
                            fast, and so did the pontoon trains, which had finally to be pulled out of the mud by the
                            infantry. The army was, in fact, stuck in the mud, and could not budge one way or the other.
                            Finally, on the 25th, the men managed to get back to the camp at White Oak Church,

                    mind. A desire to see his close relatives, however, led him on his first journey west in 1867 for a
                    brief visit.</p>
            <p>At the conclusion of his war service in 1863, he turned eagerly to his painting. In June he left <placeName>

                    was to fraternize with many of the landscape painters who have since been referred to as the Hudson
                    River School.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Among them were Asher B. Durand, one of the two "fathers" of the
                    school; Homer D. Martin; Sandford R. Gifford; Thomas Hicks; R. M. Hubbard; Jervis McEntee; and other
                    painters occupying important places in the history of American painting. He was especially close to
                    Durand, who took an almost fatherly interest in him, and to W. T. Richards, who accompanied him on
                    his trip abroad in 1855 and with whom he shared a studio for some time on their return to <placeName>

            <p>In April, 1864, Lawrie resolved to spend the summer at Elizabethtown, <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the fall. October found him established in his new location, where he remained until

                    </placeName> to make oil and crayon portraits. The winters were spent in the studio in town; the
                    summers, in the Adirondacks and the Hudson Highlands. This period marked the zenith of his career.
                    From 1866 to 1877 inclusive, except in 1867 and 1874, his paintings were represented in the annual

            <p>In the period of his greatest successes, Lawrie was elected to membership in the Athenaeum Club, the

            <p>When asked about Lawrie's paintings, Wilbur Peat, director of the John Herron Art Institute,
                    wrote, "I have not seen the portraits in the Old Soldiers' Home painted by Lawrie, but
                    judging from some of the reproductions I would say that they were very well painted."<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alexander Lawrie was never married. His earliest diary records a brief romance in the summer of 1863
                    and the following winter. Its collapse is evident only in the sudden and unexplained cessation of
                    all reference to the girl involved. A newspaper story of 1909 gives the information that no one at
                    the Home knew whether he was ever married, that he avoided women and had no confidence in them, and
                    that "it is said that during his youth he was deceived by a girl of whom he was very fond. He will
                    not speak of such a subject."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> A more likely explanation is that
                    Lawrie himself was at fault, as his diaries indicate that, to his own remorse, he often drank too
                    heavily and that he had an unhappy faculty of antagonizing people. Statements in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> papers that he was modest, unassuming, bright, and cheery35 are to be questioned, for
                    too much evidence exists that, in his old age at any rate, he was quarrelsome and irascible.</p>
            <p>In defense of his shortness of temper in his later years, it is necessary only to point out that his
                    kidney disease, contracted in 1863, was acute and that he was bothered by other ailments common to
                    advanced age. That he succeeded in painting nearly 150 portraits from his entrance to the Home in
                    1902 to his death in 1917 despite his poor health and that the portraits are as good as they are
                    testify to a talent far above average. Though their artistic value may not be exceptional, their
                    historical value, as their painter prophesied, has increased with a new generation; and to the
                    hundreds of visitors who yearly view the paintings at the Soldiers' Home, his labors have made the
                    history of the state a little more vivid.</p>

                    </placeName>, Thomas Jefferson held enough high offices to give him a place of distinction in
                    American history. That he lives in the minds and hearts of men the world over is not due to the
                    imposing list of important posts that he filled. There were qualities in the man that left an
                    indelible impression. In regard to the high stations that he occupied, it is rather that he exalted
                    them than that they added to his stature. Born in 1743, on April 13, the great <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> liberal died on July 4, 1826, at the age of eighty-three. A landholder who married into
                    one of the first families of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, conditions invited him to become a conservative. A reader and thinker as well as an
                    actor, he did not follow the most natural pathway but early became and remained a liberal to the end
                    of his long career.</p>
            <p>It has never been easy to say definitely just what greatness consists of, but the verdicts of history
                    relative to characters classified as great are seldom successfully challenged. Of all the great
                    American contemporaries of Jefferson, perhaps <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> presents the most difficult question when an attempt is made to analyze his greatness.
                    The best answer seems to be that he was possessed of a balanced judgment-that he had the poise which
                    enabled him to command the respect and attention of others no matter how keen, able, educated, or
                    philosophical they might be. With Jefferson, it was undoubtedly his power to understand men and
                    events and to evaluate them, not only at the moment, but in larger perspective. He did not float
                    with the current nor reach conclusions on the basis of his own interests or those of his class.
                    Looking backward, forward, and under the surface as he lived through his period, he interpreted
                    historic currents with rare insight.</p>

                    </placeName> had been in the making for more than a century and a half when Jefferson came to
                    manhood. Eighteenth-century <placeName>

                    of good fortune for Thomas Jefferson as it was for a number of his able contemporaries. The spell
                    that <placeName>

                    </placeName> cast over her sons and daughters in her flowering time was not lost on Jefferson, but
                    it did not dominate him. He saw the defective as well as the sound elements in the institutional
                    structure of his native province and early became a leader in the crusade to make a better and
                    greater <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. He became a reader and a thinker who was attracted by the criticisms and constructive
                    proposals of daring minds of Europe as well as of America. While yet a young man, he developed
                    strong liberal tendencies and found pleasure in exposing what he believed to be the fallacies in the
                    views of reactionaries. Not only during his young manhood and middle life did he delight in
                    puncturing the smugness of Tory minds, but he also liked to stir them up in his sunset years. It is
                    such a common observation that men who acquire property and established position as they live out
                    their days become more and more conservative with advancing years that it is not much noticed. It
                    is, however, something worthy of consideration when a man does not fit the regular formula.
                    Especially is this true when attending circumstances would naturally make the man a conservative
                    from the beginning of his public career.</p>
            <p>Jefferson lived through the age of the American and French revolutions at the time when the
                    commercial revolution reached a climax and when the industrial revolution was passing through its
                    first stages. The changing scene profoundly influenced him, but while many able men became thorough
                    reactionaries in opposition to the currents of revolution, he was not frightened by the demands or
                    doings of radicals at home or abroad. With their desires and activities, he had much sympathy, but
                    he did not advocate or plan rash or sweeping changes, much as he was hated for his liberalism by the
                    Bourbon-minded "saviors of society."</p>
            <p>When the Revolutionary War was on, many American conservatives became engrossed in the movement. In
                    the days that "tried men's souls," General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Thomas Paine felt a kinship of spirit; but when, some years later, the latter sent
                    from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> to his one-time fellow rebel fifty copies of his pamphlet, <hi rend="i">The Rights of
                        Man,</hi> conservative President Washington was much embarrassed. In <pb n="43" id="VAA4025-040-1-047"/> 1802, Paine, again in America, attended one of Jefferson's
                    receptions to which had been invited a small number of senators and representatives of both parties,
                    such a group as was frequently entertained at the President's home. An astonished and
                    disgusted Federalist guest reported that, while he was present, "Thomas Paine entered,
                    seated himself beside the President and conversed and behaved toward him with the familiarity of an
                    intimate and an equal!…"</p>
            <p>When <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> decided that he could no longer acquiesce in the activities of Genet, Jefferson joined
                    with the President and the other department heads in asking the recall of the French representative.
                    At the same time, he alone among the President's cabinet opposed the policy of ordering a
                    battery to be erected on Mud Island for the purpose of firing on the "Little Sarah," a
                    vessel of the French Republic, should it attempt to depart pending a decision of President
                    Washington. Jefferson gave as one of his reasons for this opposition that he "would not gratify the
                    combination of kings with the spectacle of the only two republics on earth destroying each other for
                    two cannon…."</p>
            <p>In 1798 when the war fever against <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> ran high, nothing would have been more natural than for Jefferson, then serving as
                    vice-president, to swim with the current. By so doing, he could have won great popularity with the
                    temporarily all-powerful war party, but he did not take this easy road. Instead, when the majority
                    embraced an antialien policy and undertook to suppress criticism of government policies and leaders,
                    he became the director of a quiet crusade which for a time looked like a forlorn undertaking. For
                    months his influence remained at low-water mark. It required great courage, patience, and faith to
                    stand by his principles in this crisis of 1798. As he said in his own way, "all the firmness of the
                    human mind" must be "in a state of requisition." As he saw his followers flock to the war
                    party in great numbers, Jefferson found himself shunned because he steadfastly stood by his
                    convictions. He wrote in this time of gloom: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Party passions are indeed high. Nobody has more reason to know it than myself. I receive
                            daily proof of it from people who never saw me, nor know anything of me but through
                            Porcupine and Fenno. At this moment all the passions are boiling over, and one who keeps
                            himself cool and clear of the contagion, is so far below the point of <pb n="44" id="VAA4025-040-1-048"/> ordinary conversation, that he finds himself insulated in every
                            society. However the fever will not last.</p>

            <p>In his letters to steadfast friends, the last note expressed in the above-quoted passage often
                    appeared. Admitting that the immediate outlook was dark, the founder of the Republican party, which
                    now seemed about to vanish, declared an opportunity would come for lost principles to be regained.
                    It was not long until his prophecies were proved to be correct. <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> made peace overtures to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> which John Adams immediately welcomed. Federalists and Republicans were almost equal in
                    strength in 1796-1797, but in 1798 the Federalists gained an overwhelming ascendancy. The sudden
                    shift to a peace policy by President Adams produced dissension among Federalist leaders, which
                    permitted a rapid return of Republican strength. In January, 1799, Jefferson referred to the war
                    hysteria as the "XYZ inflammation." The return tide was so strong in the latter part of
                    1799 and 1800 that the powerful Federalist party was slightly defeated and the Republicans took over
                    the government in 1801.</p>
            <p>Understanding the ineptitude of Federalist leaders to organize and guide the rank and file of their
                    party, Jefferson sought to detach and win over to the support of his administration large portions
                    of the Federalist following. That is why he said in his first inaugural: "We are all
                    Federalists; we are all Republicans." He did not mean that he accepted Federalist policies
                    or that the Hamiltonians would cease to hate him. By dealing kindly with them, he believed, or at
                    least hoped, that he could turn the less pretentious elements included in the Federalist ranks into
                    Republicans. Especially did he count on the return of all citizens with Republican sympathies who
                    had drifted into the war party in 1798. The Republican showing of 1804, as compared with that of
                    1800, indicates that the drift from the defeated party to the party of Jefferson was quite marked
                    from 1801 to 1804. The Federalist system was not overthrown by the new administration and the
                    so-called "revolution of 1800" meant a change of attitude and outlook rather than the overthrow of
                    established institutions or the rejection of policies.</p>
            <p>The purchase of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> was made possible because a shifting world situation forced Napoleon to adopt a change
                    of program. Prior to the acquisition, however, Jefferson had <pb n="45" id="VAA4025-040-1-049"/>
                    persistently opposed an attack on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> or West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>. Holding such a position, he ran the risk of losing the support of his western
                    followers. The situation was aggravated by the fact that Federalist Senators Gouverneur Morris and
                    James Ross cleverly championed the cause of dissatisfied and belligerent westerners. Relative to the
                    activities of Morris and Ross in the Senate, Jefferson wrote after the consummation of the purchase
                    of the vast region of <placeName>

                            did not force a premature rupture, until that event. I believed the event not very distant
                            but acknolege [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] it came sooner than I expected.</p>
                    </quote> It was fortunate for Jefferson that his hold on his supporters beyond the mountains was
                    strong enough that they were not stampeded. Their loyalty to him enabled him to succeed. His ability
                    to face the situation intelligently and relinquish his enmity to a broad construction of the
                    Constitution was another vital factor in the acquisition of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>. Consistency is a splendid quality, but it has often prevented men from taking
                    statesmanlike courses. At this important moment in his career, Jefferson dared to base his decision
                    on the welfare of his country whatever advantage might be given to hostile critics. It may be added
                    that those Federalists who condemned the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> Purchase had to face about and adopt the doctrine of strict construction.</p>
            <p>In the trying years from 1805 to 1809 when Great Britain and Napoleon tried to fight their battle
                    through the issuance of anti-neutral decrees and orders, Jefferson sought to avoid war. Believing in
                    the efficacy of employing the economic weapon, he clung stubbornly to his embargo policy through
                    1808. The policy was abandoned by the Republican party under <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but Jefferson never surrendered his belief in his embargo. The wisdom of the policy is
                    debatable, but charges that it was unsound have never been substantiated. The lack of statesmanship
                    on the part of Napoleon and the British Tory leaders in attempting to ruin each other by wrecking
                    American commerce is much more easily demonstrated.</p>
            <p>While Jefferson was President, he was supported by a majority in Congress. He was, therefore, able to
                    perform <pb n="46" id="VAA4025-040-1-050"/> like a responsible prime minster. He led his party, and
                    his party controlled both the House and Senate. Federalists had "retired into the
                    judiciary," which gave Jefferson an opportunity to reveal that he was no friend of the
                    doctrine of separation of powers. The writer is bold enough to say that this is much to his credit
                    and laments to add that American citizens have been exceedingly slow to see the foolishness and
                    danger of a system which makes frequent deadlocks possible and easy. There is reason behind
                    responsible leadership and cooperation between executive, legislative, and judicial agents of the
                    people; but government by deadlocks is well-nigh impossible. Moreover, the outmoded doctrine of
                    separation of powers is a great menace to the future of the American government. It has been amply
                    tested and found wanting and should be junked before it does irreparable harm in some crisis.</p>
            <p>The larger things in the life of Jefferson have been extensively written about. In this brief
                    treatment of the liberal leader, the fact that he often refused to follow the natural course has
                    been noted. The belief is that thus one finds the clue to his greatness. His deep interest in
                    agriculture, science, and invention, as well as in political, economic, and social problems, helped
                    to make the man what he became. His sincere concern for the welfare of people generally set him
                    apart from leaders, however able, who labored for the interests of a class and raised up enemies
                    against him. It is understandable that he should be hated, but as one studies his life from the
                    sources, it is impossible not to develop a feeling of pity for his contemporaries, especially for
                    those among them who were educated, cultured, and successful, who indulged in the luxury of
                    despising a leader who was possessed of so many interests and who was a confirmed liberal. What does
                    it profit one to hate a great man?</p>
            <p>What stand would Jefferson take on this or that policy, were he living today? This
                    question is always coming up. No one can answer it definitely in regard to any specific policy, but
                    certain statements can be made without much fear of successful contradiction. If Jefferson were to
                    live again, he would not be Jefferson unless he were a liberal. This being true, he could not defend
                    as sacred every established institution, nor could he consider the work of men who lived in an
                    earlier period under different social and <pb n="47" id="VAA4025-040-1-051"/> economic conditions as
                    final. To be himself, he would have to rejoice in the replacement of worn-out institutions, or laws,
                    or customs by others designed to promote human welfare. He would often have to reject the views of
                    reactionaries and laugh at their dire predictions of calamity should proposed innovations be tried
                    out. He could not live in our time without being hated by those who cannot abide liberalism and
                    being supported and revered by those who believe that the lot of the masses of mankind can still be
                    and should be improved.</p>
            <p>If Jefferson were privileged to come back, he would make some mistakes in regard to current problems
                    as he did when he lived. Not prone to venerate too deeply what was done by the fathers, he would
                    reject many things in the established order and criticize some of the sayings of the fathers,
                    including some of his own. Being himself, he could not accept in a new age all that seemed sound to
                    him in his own time. His opinions relative to the problems presented by American industrialism in
                    its present stage would be interesting, for these problems would seem of vast importance to him.
                    Having lived during the early stages of the industrial revolution, about which he thought and said
                    too little, he would undoubtedly find it an absorbing interest about which he would reflect and
                    write and work out some kind of program of action. A thinking contemporary of Napoleon Bonaparte, in
                    whom he lost faith when the revolution made him Emperor, Jefferson, who thought so much about the
                    problems of Europe and the world during his period of maturity, would be profoundly stirred by the
                    global conflict that is on in 1943, two hundred years after his birth. He would surely not fail to
                    comprehend the deep need for world cooperation nor to discern the reasons why favored America should
                    prove a great asset to the peoples of the rest of the world in the period of reconstruction that
                    lies ahead.</p>

            </byline>
            <p>A perusal of historical publications and of reviews of publications leaves one with the impression
                    that historical work on the whole has been haphazard. A study of sources of information about the
                    past which are available also give one the impression that the foundations upon which history is
                    constructed are equally spotty. A mind capable of grasping all written history and all records which
                    have been preserved would certainly find many gaps; it would also find many instances of
                    overelaboration, of duplication, and overemphasis which obscure understanding.</p>
            <p>Against the background of such observations demands arise for some such systematization and extension
                    of historical work as would result in a historically complete coverage of perfect proportion. These
                    demands have found expression both in individuals and in mass movements. The late Clarence W. Alvord
                    many years ago proposed that historical agencies should discontinue the publication of miscellaneous
                    source materials and should begin the systematic publication of all important records in
                    chronological order. The goal would be the complete coverage of the field of historical operations,
                    generation by generation, so that the future writer would find the data he required for a complete
                    understanding of all phases of progress and decay. Confronting such a task, any individual could
                    only throw up his hands in helplessness and despair.</p>
            <p>The Works Progress Administration took up the task as a mass movement, marshaling hundreds of workers
                    and millions of dollars in historical record surveys, writers' projects, union catalogues, and
                    various library and bibliographical projects. Individuals failed through lack of resources and
                    limitations of mind and body. The mass movement fell far short of promises held forth for it by its
                    protagonists, by the defects of its workers, and the unreliability and meaninglessness of much of
                    its product.</p>
            <p>What might be called old-line historical organizations have ploughed ahead for the most part in a
                    haphazard way, with only aspirations toward more comprehensive and systematic achievement. The list
                    of publications of many historical societies discloses a great variety of subjects dealt <pb n="49" id="VAA4025-040-1-053"/> with and an indefinite number not even touched. The societies have been
                    opportunist rather than systematic in their policy, publishing what material of requisite quality
                    (often not very high) has happened to be available. College and university departments of history
                    both in their instruction and in their publications show the same tendency. Instruction and
                    production (aside from standard, routine requirements) are determined by personal interests of
                    instructors and students, which, traced to their sources, will be found to be mostly accidental.</p>
            <p>If one could put together all the historical work of the thousands of institutions and the hundreds
                    of thousands of individuals engaged in historical study, it would make a mosaic so fragmentary, so
                    full of holes and overlappings, that it would be of little more help to a general understanding than
                    are conventional standardized textbooks.</p>
            <p>This policy of opportunism, however, has some advantages over a systematic centralized control which
                    would assign to each writer his field of study and piece the results together into a complete
                    picture. Work done along the line of one's own interest has a quality which distinguishes
                    it from work done as an assignment. Perhaps it ought not to be so, but the outcome of a task usually
                    lacks the vitality of a pursuit. The contagion of enthusiasm can never be completely harnessed to a
                    system. The personal satisfaction of working out something in which one is interested, while it will
                    not serve the interest of complete coverage and may not bring about the best use of our resources,
                    imparts an interest of priceless value.</p>
            <p>Effective historical organizations cannot sacrifice this element of personal initiative, individual
                    enthusiasms, and historical adventure. One object of the historical society must continue to be the
                    furnishing of an outlet for the products of adventures in historical research. Even, more, the
                    historical society should reveal to an increasing number of educated persons fields of interest in
                    which they would find pleasure in working; it should stimulate spontaneous historical research.</p>
            <p>The constitution of the Indiana Historical Society presented at its organization meeting 113 years
                    ago is still a good guide: "Article II. The objects of the Society shall be the collection
                    and preservation of all materials calculated <pb n="50" id="VAA4025-040-1-054"/> to shed light on
                    the natural, civil, and political history of Indiana; the publication and circulation of historical
                    documents; the promotion of useful knowledge; and the friendly and profitable intercourse of such
                    citizens as are disposed to promote these ends."</p>

            </byline>
            <p>The year 1850 introduced to the people of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> a decade of extravagant prosperity-a prosperity led by the rapid expansion in
                    transportation facilities. This decade was to witness the glory of the steamships on the
                        <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>, the grace and speed of the American clipper ships on the
                    oceans, the splendid adventure of the stagecoaches and the Pony Express on the western plains, but
                    was finally to concede the superiority of the railroads as a transportation system.</p>
            <p>At the same time the attention of the people began to be centered on one overwhelming national issue,
                    as the dark cloud known as the slavery question suddenly reappeared on the horizon and slowly but
                    terribly spread over the country. The territorial problem, raised by the cession of vast lands to
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> by its defeated neighbor, Mexico, seemed to have been settled by the Compromise of
                    1850. Men with vision, men who glimpsed the destiny of a nation united by iron rails from coast to
                    coast, began to look for the best route for such a railway. In December, 1853, the Gadsen purchase
                    was made, and the stage seemed set for Congress to authorize the shorter southern route from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> to San Diego. However, a month later, in January, 1854, not only the play, but also the
                    stage and scenery were junked, as Senator Stephen A. Douglas of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> introduced his bill to organize the Territory of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>. Out of this bill there came the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>-<region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
               </placeName> Act. From that
                    act came violence, bloodshed, and "Bleeding <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>" where no law and order prevailed, fanatics were given a crusade, radicals
                    were engendered from conservatives, and new political parties with new leaders were created.</p>
            <p>Eighteen hundred fifty-four was an eventful year! The <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>-<region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
               </placeName> Act was
                    passed, land offices were opened in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, and the fight for control of that territory was on. The negro, Anthony Burns, caused a
                    riot in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Two new political parties, the Republicans and the "Know Nothing," caught and
                    held the attention of politicians and people. <pb n="52" id="VAA4025-040-1-056"/> In the meantime,
                    the Whig- party ceased to exist and the Democrat party began to disintegrate.</p>
            <p>The Whig party-conceived in opposition to Andrew Jackson, born with more fathers than it could
                    recognize and existing in spite of them, compromising whenever possible, and even allowing soldiers
                    in the house to sit at the head of the table instead of the old fathers-finally was brought to an
                    early grave, choked to death, it has been said, attempting to swallow the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>-<region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
               </placeName> Act. Taking little time to mourn, its followers looked about for a
                    new party. A few joined the Democrats, others united with the Free Soilers, some found their way
                    into the new Republican party, but a larger number were absorbed into the more popular "Know
                    Nothing" party.</p>
            <p>This party owed its genesis to a secret society, the Order of the Star Spangled Banner, founded on
                    native American principles and especially pledged to an opposition to Roman Catholics, Irish
                    immigrants, and German radicals. As a secret society, it lured thousands into its ranks and obtained
                    its name from the answer of members to all questions about the order: "I know
                    nothing." Practical politicians recognized its value, old Whig leaders were soon high in
                    its councils, and by May, 1854, the party in a half dozen states astonished the nation by electing
                    unknown candidates. Its greatest victory was obtained in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, where it swept the state elections.</p>
            <p>The next year the party was important enough to call a national convention, which met in June at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There the Southerners gained control of the American party, as it was then called, and
                    pro-slavery resolutions were adopted. This split the party, so its destruction was swift and
                    certain. The Council of Indiana and other states separated from the national order and denounced
                    slavery and secrecy. Members soon made haste to publish their withdrawal from the party. Although it
                    finally nominated a presidential candidate for the elections of 1856, only one state, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>, supported the nominee, ex-President Millard Fillmore. It had failed, as had the other
                    fusion parties, to organize a national party. The field was left to the Republicans, and the men of
                    these various parties found in that party the answer to their demands.</p>
            <p>Orth was an anti-slavery Whig, who realized the impotence of the Whig party, and was eager to have it
                    fuse <pb n="53" id="VAA4025-040-1-057"/> with other parties opposed to the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>-<region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
               </placeName> Act. THen, as the Know Nothing movement gained momentum, he was one
                    of those who joined its ranks, and soon rose to the high position of president of the Council in
                    Indiana for 1854-1855. After its downfall he joined the Peoples party and then helped organize the
                    Republican party in Indiana.</p>
            <p>His letters are filled with references to the order. In a letter dated February 5, 1855, he remarked
                    that the Whig party could not then be revitalized. As may be seen there are very noticeable gaps in
                    these letters to Colfax-one from 1849 to 1854, and one from 1855 to 1860. It is difficult to believe
                    that Orth discontinued his correspondence with Colfax during these times, especially during the
                    latter period, when both were engaged in the very interesting task of organizing the Republican
                    party in Indiana. It is possible that not all the Orth letters to Colfax are with the Orth
                    Collection at the Indiana State Library, but some still may be with Colfax collections in other
                    depositories. A third group of Orth letters will be published in a subsequent issue. See the
                    December, 1942, issue of this publication for the first group of Orth letters.</p>

                                    is second to none in the Union and our desire is to establish an Institution that
                                    will be a credit to our State as well as profitable to the Stockholders.</p>

                        <p>I was glad to learn thro, our mutual friend George, that Mrs C. contemplates a visit

                                    </placeName> and would spend some time at our house. I need not assure that Mrs O
                                    &amp; myself will be very happy to have her come and make OakDale her home until
                                    after the Campaign, when her liege lord will be relieved from the toils of the
                                    contest, and return crowned with the laurels of Victory!<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>An hour ago however I met Dr. Derning who says he wrote you yesterday that it would
                                    not be advisable for Mrs C. to visit La <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Fayette</region>
                                    </placeName> at present on account of the Cholera &amp;c. When I told the Dr.
                                    that the calculation was for Mrs C. to spend most, if not all, of her time! with us
                                    in the Country, he said "Write Brother Colfax and say to him, in my opinion it would
                                    be perfectly safe for his Lady to come &amp; stay at OakDale." My
                                    object therefore in writing now, is to add the last opinion of the Dr. and to say
                                    that we trust Mrs C. will not fail to come as contemplated….</p>

                        <salute>My dear Colfax:-</salute>
                        <p>I received your letter of the 16th this afternoon and to a friend so candid as
                                    yourself I cannot speak save in the language of unreserved frankness- That my name
                                    should be associated with so exalted a position as that of U. S. S. is to me
                                    certainly a matter of sincere gratification, and I trust that (whether success or
                                    defeat be my lot) I shall ever retain a warm &amp; lasting rememberance of the
                                    efforts of those, who are now enlisted in my behalf- Let this suffice.</p>
                        <p>Since the 13th July I have been frequently approached on the Senator question-by
                                    personal friends in several parts of the State, but thus far have studiously avoided
                                    a discussion of the matter except with one or two confidential friends- The election
                                    resulting as it has, I do not consider it improper to talk about it at least when
                                    spoken to-</p>
                        <p>In the first place, the Senate from present appearances will be a tie, if we count
                                    the hold-overs at 15 dem. &amp; 10 Whig- But of the 15-I feel pretty well
                                    assured that Cutshaw<hi rend="sup">8</hi> of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> &amp; perhaps Hooks<hi rend="sup">9</hi> of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Ripley</settlement>
                                    </placeName> will go with the People- This was understood to be their position
                                    during the Campaign-</p>
                        <p>But suppose it be a <hi rend="i">tie</hi> will they take the responsibility of a
                                    postponement? You may reply "they did so once before" True but the
                                    Legislature met annually and besides they had the excuse (lame one I grant it.) of
                                    having the popular vote on their side- But it's useless to conjecture- If
                                    they have the power and will exercise it-we shall, two years hence, beat them worse
                                    than now.</p>
                        <p>The next Legislature will have to elect a Senator-a State Printer-a <hi rend="i">State Agent</hi>–and may (if they see proper) erect a special Bank
                                    Department, and thus make a good office for some one-</p>
                        <p>I agree with you as to the fusion-and if we have those four officers to elect (and
                                    the Speaker) makes 5.) it will be well (if necessary.) to give the Anti N.
                                    [Nebraskan] Democrats 2, the Freesoilers one or two &amp; the Whigs one or two-
                                        Riley<hi rend="sup">10</hi> I regret to say is defeated by that mass of moral
                                    putridity Walpole-or he would do well for Speaker. Sol: Meredith<hi rend="sup">11</hi> will want the place-and if he does we <hi rend="i">must use</hi> him.
                                    Parker is the only man I have to fear-(at least so I think now.) Marshall is not
                                    formidable &amp; Dick Thorn[p]son- is rather too much of a National Whig to have
                                    strength among Fusionists. If Sol's heart is on the Speakership his
                                    election will hurt Parker, besides Sol's influence could be had for Senator
                                    in exchange <list type="footnotes">

                                    themselves in bringing about such a result. 19-21-16-19 [Test] says that he is
                                    warmly disposed toward me, and told me, that his County man, being out of the way,
                                    he will be for me- He ought to be, in consideration of old chores- He took special

                                    he would use his influence for me. This, to me, is very unexpected-as I supposed I
                                    should be his 4th. choice at least. Do you know anything of his

                        <p>I did not approach 6-1-9-9-20 [Barry] as he is not at all reliable. We are personally
                                    very friendly-and I am satisfied he will do nothing against me. A [man] stronger
                                    than he, is working warmly zealously and effectively for me. I refer to

                                    the benefit of some friend. Suffice it to say all is chaos and confusion-and the
                                    opinions and plans of yesterday yield as rapidly to those of today-and they made

                           <hi rend="sup">33</hi> At the last meeting of our S. C. in
                                    Sept. it was resolved that I should call a special meeting in January, if I deemed
                                    it conducive to the best interest of the order. Now the question is what shall I
                                    do&amp;#x003F;-and I must confess this gives me some trouble- If I call the
                                    meeting it will be attributed to improper and personal motives and if I dont, the

                                    convened should not take positive action on the Senator question tho they have the

                                    is their duty to take this action, and they would be derelict if they did not. Of

                        <p>I had intended writing to you long since-but really had nothing of importance to
                                    communicate- I returned from Inds on Saturday ev[en]ing &amp;amp; will go back
                                    in a day or two- Matters there stand in about the same way as when you left-
                                    Marshall&amp;apos;s friends claim they have enough to nominate him-yet they now
                                    appear to be unwilling to make any nomination before we know there is to be an
                                    election-In this they have changed their tactics and for what reason they of course
                                    know best-but still every one is at leave to draw his own inferences- My opinion is
                                    they have not the power to nominate &amp;amp; can not get that power but I may
                                    be mistaken-</p>

                                    believe there will be an election-after the 22nd. I have this opinion merely upon

                        <p>The cauldron is still boiling-and the political witches are filling it with all sorts
                                    of clean &amp;amp; unclean things, and what the final issue will be no one seems
                                    able to divine.</p>
                        <p>The old lines in the Senate have determined to take no action until after the meeting
                                    of their Convention on the 22nd and if party drill, heretofore so potent, will be
                                    able to retain its power they will in all probability indefinitely postpone- Some 4
                                    of their Senators are trembling in their shoes-and it will require an extra
                                    tightening of the screws-and strengthening of the cords to bind them to the
                                    observance of the behests of their leaders. Still they may succeed-They however
                                    anticipate trouble-and are feeling round with bold hands to see if Ml. [Marshall]
                                    and myself can be displaced to enable some more pliable man to fill the position.</p>

                        <p>Our folks have a good deal of diversity of opinion among them as to the propriety of
                                    making a nomination at this time-some favoring-others disapproving- Last night they
                                    attempted to hold a caucus for that purpose but failed- They will attempt again
                                    tomorrow night -but will also fail I think.</p>
                        <p>I am decidedly opposed to the measure, regarding it as deliterious not only to the
                                    nominee but also to the Party-a mere trick of the enemy-and promising no good.</p>

                                    characterized their operations during the earlier part of the session- He has
                                    evidently lost ground and I should be much mistaken if he could now receive the
                                    nomination. Mh. is active as ever-and says he is gaining strength daily- His
                                    untiring energy is worth a good deal-and I am satisfied that he has more strength
                                    that he gets credit for- He professes to speak by authority of the Brights36

                        <salute>Dear Colfax-</salute>
                        <p>Your letter is reed-Our folks had a caucus tonight &amp;amp; just adjourned (10
                                    OCIock.) The object of the Marshall men was to force a nomination &amp;amp;
                                    Meredith&amp;apos;s men joined them. I alone stood out, assisted by
                                    Parker&amp;apos;s friends- No nomination was made-considerable feeling-a
                                    resolution passed to nominate on Wednesday next. This action would augur
                                    favorably-but still it is best to Keep cool-for as the saw runs, there is no telling
                                    who will be Governor until after the election.</p>
                        <p>I do wish you could be here at that time-and I know you will if in your

                        <salute>Dear Colfax-</salute>
                        <p>I have just finished reading the Register of yesterday and perceive that in
                                    consequence of "the entire absence of organization" and the Sunday meeting of the
                                    Dutch, you have been beaten in your township election. If "Sam,&amp;quot; were
                                    Kept alive &amp;amp; kicking this would not be, and I fear if he is not revived
                                    in your hearts you may have to chronicle similar victories throughout the glorious
                                    "9th District" hereafter, for by a letter received from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>
                                    </placeName> tonight I learn the existence of a similar state of affairs in their
                                    town. Here we meet twice a week, initiate from 5 to 10 each night (last Saturday
                                    19,) and we elected our ticket by more than 2 to 1, with a very heavy foreign vote
                                    against us.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="i">Eternal vigilance</hi> is the price of liberty! You may depend upon
                                    it-the enemy is secretly organizing all over the State-and unless we are up and
                                    doing we shall be shorn of our strength and the "Forum" will entwine "wreaths" over
                                    more important contests-</p>
                        <p>Bro. Crawford paid me a business visit last night-and I made him promise to pass thru
                                    Northern Indiana-which he promised to do in two or three weeks. I hope the breathen
                                    will give him a cordial welcome and relight the camp fires of the Revolution.</p>
                        <p>Did you receive my last letter&amp;#x003F; It contained some things which the
                                    vulgar eye ought not to see….</p>

                                    you will meet with us &amp;amp; proceed in company with the rest of the

                        <p>I have been looking anxiously for your promised letter, detailing the proceedings
                                    &amp;amp; inside feeling of the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                                    </placeName> Cont. but have looked in vain. I have no doubt however, that like
                                    myself, you have had your hands full of other matters- I gave an account of our
                                    stewardship to our brethren here &amp;amp; they unanimously approved of our
                                    course-I doubt not, such will be the feeling throughout the State, except the 1st
                                    &amp;amp; 2nd Congl District. Here there will be trouble, Gregg<hi rend="sup">37</hi> has already pitched into you &amp;amp; me, and refuses to "follow our
                                    lead.&amp;quot; I had a long letter from Col. Sigler who is not well pleased-and
                                    other 'croakers' will doubtless make themselves heard in due time. The meeting for
                                    the 13th may be premature, but since it is called we must do all we can to secure a
                                    large attendance, and we must endeavor to have wise counsel prevail.</p>
                        <p>We must not lose sight of the fact, that while there is a strong Anti-Slavery feeling
                                    in the State, there is also a strong American feeling-and both must be preserved
                                    &amp;amp; united if possible, else both go by the board-You will of course
                                    attend the S. C. on the 11th &amp;amp; see that your neighboring Counties are
                                    represented.</p>
                        <p>We have a wily and implacable enemy, who matches every step we take and who will take
                                    advantage of the first error we commit. Let us then be circumspect, cautious
                                    &amp;amp; liberal toward our breathen throughout the State and we can bind
                                    ourselves by cords so strong that the efforts of Old Liners will be utterly futile
                                    &amp;amp; abortive hereafter-Let me hear from you fully-I should write more, but
                                    have other letters on hand….</p>

                    </placeName> history by college freshmen. The survey was regarded as revealing a lack of information

                    too many education courses and too few history courses, and that the licensing of teachers was
                    inadequately handled. Too many prominent university leaders voiced one or more of these opinions for
                    anyone to doubt that many intelligent persons have felt that certain developments in the educational
                    field during the present century represent experiments rather than progress, and that as a result,
                    the quality of the teaching of history has declined.</p>
            <p>Before this discussion had subsided, the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> Historical
                    Association, in its meeting at Cedar Rapids, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, on April 23, authorized its newly elected president, Dean Theodore C. Blegen of the
                    University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, to appoint a committee to investigate the teaching of American history. The Committee
                    was instructed to cooperate with the American Historical Association. Subsequently, representatives
                    of the National Council for the Social Studies and high school teachers were added to the Committee.
                    This Committee was given over eight thousand dollars to make the investigation. The report, which
                    was prepared between June and October, has now appeared in print.1 The Committee <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>, was the director.</p>
            <p>The report begins with a chapter devoted to the question, "Do Americans Know Their Own
                    History&amp;#x003F;" The conclusion reached was that Americans do not know factual history but
                    that they do understand trends, appreciate past events, and see a connection between the experience
                    of the nation and that of the individual. The importance of a knowledge of American history is then
                    stated and a survey given of the extent of instruction in the classroom. The contribution of many
                    agents, such as the press, towards a knowledge of history is considered "significant,&amp;quot;
                    but faulty. The relations between history and other social studies are described and recommendations
                    offered as to the content of history courses. Under the heading of "The Social Studies
                    Teacher,&amp;quot; the problems of training, certification, and improvement of teachers are
                    discussed and a number of recommendations are offered. That the teaching of history should be kept
                    free of legislative restrictions is the burden of the ninth chapter. A brief summary chapter
                    concludes the report.</p>
            <p>As one would expect, the report is neither wholly good nor wholly bad. The recommendations enumerated
                    in the final chapter are such that they will doubtless commend themselves to many readers. Several
                    will be challenged and some may be rejected.</p>
            <p>A very acceptable chapter is the sixth, entitled "Recommended Content for American History
                    Courses.&amp;quot; If one notices that the suggested dates are called "Representative Dates" and
                    the persons are "Representative Persons" and are not intended to be complete lists, the suggestions
                    should be acceptable even though many important dates and individuals are omitted. The chapter
                    attacks a serious problem and makes a serious effort to suggest a solution. It does not assume that
                    repetition of subject matter must be eliminated in the various courses in our school system but does
                    suggest that the content of history is now so inclusive that it is possible to vary the emphasis in
                    the courses taught in the different grades.</p>
            <p>The chapter on "American History in Colleges" is one which will probably also receive general
                    approval. It might be pointed out that many of the recommendations contain <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-040-1-073"/> ideas which are not much more advanced than many courses now being
                    taught in our colleges and universities and that it is much easier to recommend a synthesis of all
                    phases of American life in survey courses than it is to create such a synthesis. It might also be
                    stated that to increase the content of a course as far as has been suggested means that the total
                    course would represent a very thin treatment. When students come to college with poorer preparation
                    in history year after year, it is demanding considerable of college instructors and students that
                    all phases of history be taught adequately, interestingly, with class discussions and student
                    conferences, and that all this be crowded into a three-hour two-semester course. It will require
                    better instructors, better students, and nothing less than a miracle of organization. The Committee
                    did not offer an outline or syllabus of such a course. The recommendations are, however, generally
                    acceptable and deserving of support.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the report gives evidence of unseemly haste, which may in part account for some of
                    its defects. Among these may be mentioned faulty and unscientific procedure. This is indicated by a
                    failure of the Committee to regard adequately some of the evidence produced by its own testing
                    program as well as other available evidence. The report indicates that high school boys having the
                    senior course in American history made a median grade of only 24 as compared with a median grade of
                    23 for boys not having the course. The median for girls was 22 and 20 out of a possible score of 65.
                    The senior high school history course, then, made a difference of only one or two points in the
                    median. The Committee commented: &amp;quot;Some would be inclined to conclude from the
                    performance of high school students that their instruction is either meagre or
                    ineffective.&amp;quot; On this the Committee seems to be correct, but in the next sentence it
                    contradicts the above by continuing: &amp;quot;Such a conclusion is not justified by any
                    evidence in this chapter or by the accumulation of similar evidence about other subjects [pp.
                    11-12].&amp;quot; Isn't this a failure to face the facts&amp;#x003F; Shouldn't good high
                    school teaching increase the knowledge of American history more than the one or two points indicated
                    by these findings&amp;#x003F; Did the Committee not have faith in its own test&amp;#x003F;
                    Perhaps question 18 destroyed a little of that faith. The picture of the house which the student was
                    expected to state <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-040-1-074"/> as typical of American houses in one of four
                    periods was not typical of any.</p>
            <p>Another evidence of imperfect procedure occurred when the Committee went to the laws of the states,
                    the directives of the state boards of education, and lists of courses taught in forty-nine cities to
                    find out what history courses are being taught. It seemed to realize that there was a question of
                    interpretation of these laws and directives and that the actual performance in many schools may be
                    very different from that contemplated by the lawmakers and state boards. The press had already
                    called attention to this situation in two states. Apparently, however,' the Committee made little or
                    no effort to find out how courses are actually taught, or to what extent social studies courses are
                    being substituted for history. A few years after World War I, a bright young lady in West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> described before a meeting of teachers a new method for teaching a course in modern
                    European history. She started with the peace treaty and from there on any resemblance to
                    chronological procedure was purely coincidental, but the course was called history.</p>
            <p>The Committee also failed to distinguish between history teachers and social studies teachers. The
                    terms "social studies teacher" and "history teacher" are used as though they were synonymous in
                    chapter eight. This is "muddy thinking" or no thinking at all. The investigation was to concern
                    American history and not social studies. It is quite possible that in actual practice the history
                    teacher is the social studies teacher, or the social studies teacher gives the history courses; but
                    if the investigation was to concern inadequate teaching of history, that subject should have been
                    differentiated from other factors so far as possible. The failure to make this distinction may be a
                    fundamental reason for the inadequacy of history teaching. It is surprising that a committee which
                    contained a number of distinguished historians should have made this error. Indeed, it may justify a
                    question as to the part played by the historians in the preparation of the report. It tends to prove
                    the lack of wisdom in bringing the educators and the Council of the Social Studies into the
                    investigation. The recommendations for improving the teachers are for social studies teachers, not
                    history teachers. It is very easy to see that the requirements for teaching civics, sociology, or
                    economics may be very different from the teaching <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-040-1-075"/> of history,
                    but the Committee showed no realization of this fact. Indeed, the difficulty of trying to be well
                    informed in many subjects may be an important reason why a teacher is poorly prepared to teach
                    history.</p>
            <p>There is also a failure to distinguish between history and tradition or between facts and myths in
                    the fourth chapter, entitled "History Beyond the Classroom.&amp;quot; The author of this chapter
                    indicates that historical information, sometimes accurate and sometimes not, may be gained from the
                    press, novels, motion pictures, plays, radio programs, libraries, historical societies and museums,
                    monuments, pageants, speeches, family and community traditions, and place names. Caution is
                    suggested and some of the problems connected with these agencies are briefly stated. But are works
                    of history ever read by anyone after leaving the classroom &amp;#x003F; Why do publishers
                    publish the works of Albert J. Beveridge or Claude G; Bowers &amp;#x003F; Wouldn't the chapter
                    have been more satisfactory if more emphasis had been placed upon the reading of substantial history
                    and less upon newspapers, novels, motion pictures, and the radio &amp;#x003F; No wonder the
                    Committee&amp;apos;s test indicated that a large percentage thought that Thomas Jefferson helped
                    to frame the Constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. A radio commentator had said so.</p>
            <p>More disappointing than the shortcomings already noticed was the failure of the Committee to
                    investigate and treat certain situations in our educational system which have developed in the
                    present century. First of these is the training of prospective teachers in our schools of education.
                    Some improvement has been noticed in recent years in respect to emphasis upon content courses in
                    contrast to theory courses. How adequate has this improvement been&amp;#x003F; How much more
                    could be achieved had the Committee executed its task less swiftly and with greater thought and
                    courage&amp;#x003F;</p>
            <p>The Committee has recognized that the standards of certifying teachers are "none too
                    successful.&amp;quot; It did not, however, illustrate the reasons for this lack of success or
                    the extent of inadequate conditions. It seemed to be afraid to step on the toes of educationalists.
                    Its recommendations are general and probably not far in advance of conditions that have been
                    described as "none too successful.&amp;quot; Why did it not try to work out some plan whereby
                    professors of content courses could participate in the process of certification and <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-040-1-076"/> thus assist in making less frequent the assignment of unprepared
                    persons to teach history&amp;#x003F;</p>
            <p>A third failure to take advantage of the present situation is due to the Committee&amp;apos;s not
                    investigating the substitution of social science courses for history in colleges and secondary and
                    elementary schools. Its assumption that laws, directives, and lists of courses, as previously noted,
                    could be depended upon to give an adequate picture of actual conditions prevented the treatment of
                    this important topic. Social sciences are perfectly legitimate, and they may be superior to history
                    courses; but their introduction into the curriculum and particularly their replacing history courses
                    are very likely to be a cause of the inadequate knowledge of history. The Committee seems not to
                    have faced this possibility.</p>
            <p>These three failures are so serious as to make the actual contributions of the report appear very
                    inadequate. Every educator knows of the discussion concerning the neglect of content courses and the
                    multiplication of educational theory courses, about the need for participation of content teachers
                    in the certification of teachers, and the activities of the "progressive school" of educators in
                    substituting social science methods and courses for history. Why did the Committee not treat these
                    fundamentals&amp;#x003F; Some historians need to be told about improvements that have been made.
                    Some educators need to be told that more improvements are needed. The Committee certainly did not
                    take advantage of its opportunity.</p>
            <p>One can only hope that the better portions of the report will be influential, that the poorer parts
                    will be forgotten, and that some way may be found to make a thorough investigation of the questions
                    which the Committee failed to treat or treated so inadequately.</p>

            <p>Because of William Preston Johnston&amp;apos;s connections and contacts with great men of the
                    South and because of his versatile nature and varied achievements in his own right, the author makes
                    a good case for the worth-whileness of a <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-040-1-077"/> biography of this
                    southerner. This is the first serious biographical study of Johnston published.</p>
            <p>William Preston Johnson was "the son of Albert Sidney Johnston, a Confederate general killed at the
                    battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His mother, Henrietta Preston Johnston, likewise came from a prominent family. Born in
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, in 1831, Johnston continued to live in his native state
                    until the Civil War. After he was four years of age, at which time his mother died, most of his
                    youth was spent in the care of his maternal relatives. He attended Centre College, Western Military
                    Institute, and Yale College from which he was graduated in 1852. At the latter institution he was
                    thrown into close contact with Andrew D. White and Daniel C. Gilman, who, like himself, were to
                    become presidents and guiding spirits in the founding of three universities. He took a law course in
                    the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1853.</p>
            <p>The Civil War found Johnston, like his father, on the southern side. Serving as major and
                    lieutenant-colonel of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> regiments and then as aide-de-camp to President Jefferson Davis, he came into close
                    contact with the important political and military leaders of the Confederacy. At the close of the
                    war he was captured along with Davis, and the author presents some interesting evidence from the
                    Johnston papers on the historic and world-shaking (&amp;#x003F;) question as to how Davis was
                    dressed when captured. He was dressed &amp;quote;as usual.&amp;quot;</p>
            <p>Johnston, like some other southern leaders, had difficulty in reconciling himself with the fact of a
                    defeated South and remained something of an "unreconstructed rebel.&amp;quot; Five years before
                    his death in 1899 he wrote, &amp;quot;… my heart was buried with the Confederacy. On
                    it will be found engraved at the day of doom, 'C.S.A.' " But nostalgic reflections on the "Lost
                    Cause" did not prevent a great future as educator, lecturer, and writer from opening before him. In
                    1866 he was invited by General Robert E. Lee, president of Washington College (later <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Lee University), to fill the chair of history and English literature, a position he
                    held until 1877. For a brief period in the early 1880&amp;apos;s he served as president of
                    Louisiana State University where, because of political factors and financial difficulties, life was
                    none too pleasant for him. Johnston&amp;apos;s greatest opportunity and greatest service in the
                    educational field came with the <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-040-1-078"/> founding of Tulane University in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>

            <p>In the meantime, Johnston, as professor and president, did considerable lecturing and writing, first
                    in the field of history and English literature and later in the field of education. His published
                    works include several volumes of poems; but his greatest work, thinks the author, is his biography
                    of his father. Professor Shaw pictures Johnston as a liberal on labor relations, when such a
                    position was unpopular; but on race relations he held the prevailing views of his section.</p>
            <p>Having gleaned his materials largely from published and unpublished primary sources, the footnotes in
                    the volume indicate that the author has done scholarly work. As is not infrequently the case,
                    however, the style of writing hardly reaches as high a standard. The few typographical errors
                    indicate a high standard of editing. A bibliography and index are included.</p>

                    of a great city,&amp;quot; is the publisher&amp;apos;s characterization of this interesting
                    book. The contents fit the description. It is engrossing and quick-paced. It has some of the
                    characteristics of history, but it adheres to literary methods and aims rather than the technique of
                    the historian. It emphasizes the dramatic even though the dramatic may not be typical or
                    particularly significant. It is the result of research in records written by contemporaries of the
                    events described as newspapers and diaries. But diaries of children and a pageant which seems to
                    have influenced the narrative in the latter part seem less likely to be reliable historical sources.
                    Imaginary conversations and statements placed in quotations make it difficult to identify real
                    quotations. It is, therefore, correct to describe it as a story rather than history, although it
                    gives a vivid picture of the city&amp;apos;s life.</p>
            <p>Consequently, it should be evaluated as to the effectiveness of the picture of <placeName>

                    understood than the later periods. Beginning with the Civil War the author has a surer grasp of
                    historical developments. In the industrial period slight attention is given to labor and the rise of
                    the city&amp;apos;s economic structure does not figure in proportion to its importance. Facts
                    unfavorable to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> are also almost entirely lacking. The critical attitude which Booth Tarkington
                    presented in <hi rend="i">The Turmoil</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Magnificent Ambersons</hi> is not to
                    be found in the present work. Readers will have little hesitancy in classifying Mrs. Nolan as a
                    devout Hoosier. Mrs. Nolan&amp;apos;s study of the poet James W. Riley, in contrast, has enabled
                    her to bring him into the present story and to write one of the better portions of the book
                    concerning his time.</p>
            <p>On the positive side many readers will secure from this volume a better understanding of the <placeName>

            <p>Two years ago I had the privilege and pleasure of talking to this group on the "Tools and Techniques
                    of Genealogical Research.&amp;quot;<hi rend="sup">2</hi> My paper at that time was rather
                    general and was composed partly of directions to the beginner and the somewhat advanced amateur, and
                    partly of hints which I hoped would be useful to the more experienced researcher. However, my
                    closing remarks-the last six sentences, in factwere a plea for accuracy, a demand that the
                    genealogist test and verify every note, every reference, every scrap of information discovered by
                    him before admitting it to serious consideration in his work.</p>
            <p>In the two years that have elapsed since that plea, I have seen a good many so-called genealogists at
                    work, and I have used a great many so-called family histories and genealogical compilations of
                    various kinds, and I have decided that the few sentences of warning with which I closed that paper
                    were perhaps the most important words I uttered that day.</p>
            <p>It is, I am afraid, a sad but indisputable fact that most genealogical research being carried on
                    today in this library and in every other library in the country is inaccurate, slipshod, and, in
                    many instances, consciously or unconsciously perverted from the truth to serve the researchers' own
                    ends. This is in part because the activity is being carried on by workers who are untrained in the
                    science of research, but it also is largely due to the fact that perhaps ninety per cent of the
                    books used by these seekers after family history contain factual errors, false assumptions, and
                    reckless reasoning.</p>
            <p>In other words, we have a field of study in which the research materials are both reliable and
                    unreliable. Unfortunately, there are more unreliable sources than in any other field, while at the
                    same time the workers using those materials have had less training in critical research procedure
                    than workers in other branches of study. Given such a situation, nothing can result but a constant
                    multiplication of <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-040-1-082"/> errors and a constant decline in the reputation of genealogy and
                    genealogists.</p>
            <p>It certainly is not my purpose to condemn all amateur genealogy. There are many competent amateurs
                    and there are many incompetent professionals. Nevertheless, it is true, I think, that the truly
                    valuable and reliable works in this field are almost entirely the work of the skilled professional.
                    But we cannot overlook the work of the skilled amateur, or even the conscientious unskilled amateur.
                    Both make important contributions, if it is only to provide clues to the trained worker, and even
                    the work of the most uncritical beginner is likely to be found accurate in the recent generations.</p>
            <p>The solution, perhaps, is to discourage the incompetents, the mere seekers after reflected glory, the
                    social climbers, and those who want a coat-of-arms because it will look handsome as a decoration
                    over their mantel. Once these pathetic folk and the professionals who cater to them have been weeded
                    out, we must proceed to educate the remaining serious workers to a proper appreciation of the
                    complex nature and actual science of genealogical research. We must point out to them the
                    qualifications for professional work, the strict disciplines and techniques that must be developed,
                    and the unfailing regard for the proven fact which must be the touchstone of all their efforts. Not
                    until such weeding out and such education has taken place can the defenders of genealogical research
                    be respected as the science it really is.</p>
            <p>I am not the first to criticize the mass of genealogical publications, or to insist upon a program of
                    improvement. But the interest in genealogy appears to be spreading instead of diminishing, even
                    despite the war, and I therefore feel that a few remarks on this subject, colored by my own
                    observations and experiences, may not be entirely useless.</p>
            <p>Let me discourage in two ways: first, by pointing out some common misconceptions concerning what is
                    possible in genealogy and heraldry; and second, by pointing out the truly exacting nature of real
                    genealogical research. Both discussions will, I trust, discourage the error-propagating drabblers,
                    but the second discussion, though it may give pause to the serious worker, will also, perhaps, show
                    him a way and a hope.</p>
            <p>Apparently one of the fondest dreams of the amateur genealogist is that he will be able to trace his
                    family to a <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-040-1-083"/> royal, or at least a noble origin. Admitted or
                    unadmitted, this dream is the spur that goads him in his labors, and very frequently it is strong
                    enough to cause him to overlook all sorts of inconsistencies and impossibilities in the pedigree
                    which finally "proves" such origin. And yet the facts, as pointed out a few years ago by the late
                    Mr. J. G. Bartlett, nationally known genealogist, are that not one of the five thousand heads of
                    families who came to America between 1620 and 1640 was actually of royal or noble birth. Moreover,
                    less than one per cent are known to have belonged to the upper gentry of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, and only five per cent were of the minor mercantile or landed gentry. Despite this
                    fact, there are scores of published American family histories which claim royal or noble descent,
                    and which are graced by handsome colored reproductions of the family coat of arms.</p>
            <p>We have often heard it said that any person with English blood might (if all the records were
                    available) trace his ancestry to Alfred the Great. This may be true, but the line would be so long
                    that there would probably be small satisfaction in the possession of a very tiny drop of the blood
                    of Alfred the Great.</p>
            <p>The point may be better illustrated by an example much closer home. Many Americans are thrilled to
                    learn, or strive mightily to prove, that their families arrived on the "Mayflower.&amp;quot; We
                    can sympathize with their enthusiasm, but we can only smile when knowledge of such descent leads
                    them to think that they are in exclusive company. The simple genealogical fact is that the
                    descendants of John Alden alone number at least five million.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the passion of some Americans for coats-of-arms has resulted in a situation distressing to the
                    serious genealogical worker. All professional genealogists and all genealogical librarians are
                    constantly plagued by clients or readers in search of the family arms. Such persons often seize upon
                    the first handsome coat they see belonging to a family of the same surname and take it as their own.
                    Or they may fall into the hands of an unscrupulous professional-and there are a few-who will provide
                    them with anything they want for a fee.</p>
            <p>Actually, very few American families are entitled to bear <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-040-1-084"/> arms. A coat-of-arms belongs only to the person to whom it was
                    granted and, like any other piece of property, to his direct descendants. Other persons of the same
                    surname, no matter how closely or how distantly related, have no right to it unless they descend
                    from the original owner. Consequently, the right to bear arms in this country is limited to those
                    comparatively few families who can show direct descent from an arms-bearing ancestor.</p>
            <p>The whole subject of heraldry is widely misunderstood, even by many professionals, and it may be
                    permissible, in this paper on genealogical facts and foibles, to take a few minutes to discuss the
                    matter.</p>
            <p>Historically, heraldry sprang from necessity, that mother of most inventions. It began as a mark of
                    identification in social intercourse, and it found its full flowering as a useful art in the Middle
                    Ages when it came to be used to distinguish warriors on the battlefield.</p>
            <p>Originally a knight was free to choose his own device, but by the fifteenth century the
                    multiplication of arms resulted in the complete systemization of the practice, and heraldry became
                    an exact science. Armorial bearings came to be granted by the king, and all arms, both the recently
                    granted and those established by right of ancient usage, were registered with the College of Arms,
                    if English, or with similar agencies in continental countries.</p>
            <p>The need for such identification declined with the passing of chivalry, but the custom was anchored
                    in antiquity, and had a definite appeal of its own. It held on and, of course, flourishes to this
                    day with the usual number of meaningless but completely accepted additions.</p>
            <p>The important point in all this, is that persons claiming the right to bear arms, still must prove
                    their descent from the men to whom those arms were granted or confirmed by the College of Arms, or,
                    if they wish a new coat, still must apply to the College of Arms, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>But let us consider in greater detail the situation as it affects Americans.</p>
            <p>While this country was under English domination, before the Revolutionary War, there was some general
                    regulation of the right to bear arms, or at least there were customs and rules of the mother country
                    which the colonists should have followed. Apparently, however, no effort was made <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-040-1-085"/> by the colonial governors to compel the citizens to abide by the laws,
                    and as a result the later colonists did pretty much as they pleased about displaying anything which
                    struck their fancy. Some of the residents were, of course, descended from gentle and noble families,
                    and were entitled to bear arms. Others were not, but as they grew in wealth and social prestige,
                    they, too, desired to obtain arms such as their neighbors had. Some of these persons really tried to
                    trace descent from an armigerous ancestor, but Others simply appropriated any design that was
                    pleasing or that seemed significant in their situation.</p>
            <p>At the close of the seventeenth century this illegal use of arms was helped along by an obliging
                    carriage painter of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> named Gore. Mr. Gore created arms for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> socialites of that day, and eventually he made a roll of arms which is completely
                    without authority, but which is useful today as showing what families were then claiming the right
                    to use arms.</p>
            <p>About a century later another gentleman performed similar labors throughout New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. The work of this man, a Mr. Cole, has even less authority than Gore&amp;apos;s,
                    but his influence, perhaps, has been more widespread and therefore more ~ disastrous in its results.
                    In my early years at Newberry Library I well remember being puzzled by the large number of persons
                    who came to me carrying tattered old paintings of the family arms. The painting, I was usually
                    assured, was the original design submitted to their ancestor by the College of Arms, and this
                    valuable document had been brought to America by the immigrating member of the family. I was further
                    puzzled by the fact that all these paintings had certain characteristics in common, such as an
                    elaborately embroidered shield, two leek-or onion-leaves crossed beneath the shield, a much too high
                    placing of the crest above the helmet, and a motto which usually ran "By the name of
                    Smith,&amp;quot; or "By the name of Jones,&amp;quot; or whatever the family name happened to
                    be. Eventually I learned that these all were the productions of the Mr. Cole in question, and that
                    all were fraudulent. I have, I am afraid, wounded many of our library&amp;apos;s readers by
                    pointing out this forgery.</p>
            <p>During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the wholesale assumption of arms reached huge
                    proportions. Most persons took them without the shadow of a claim. Some <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-040-1-086"/> Americans then believed, and some still do, that the bearing of a
                    surname the same as an armigerous family entitles them to use the same arms. I repeat, that a
                    coat-of-arms belongs only to the person to whom it was granted, and to those who can prove direct
                    descent, through the direct line, from that person. Because of American interest in heraldry, the
                    New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> Historic Genealogical Society, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, has created a Committee on Heraldry. It is the function of this Committee to
                    investigate and establish the right to certain American families to bear arms, and it has published
                    a roll of authentic coats-of-arms. It must, however, be borne in mind that such registration has no
                    legal effect, or any meaning other than that, in the opinion of the Committee, such arms are
                    rightfully used by certain families. The Committee accepts all coats where descent is proved from a
                    grantee of arms or from a family that has used them from mediaeval times. It also accepts arms where
                    it can be proved that the first comer to this country used them; but if it be shown that such user
                    was without right, the arms are removed from the list.</p>
            <p>This Committee is as close as we can come on this side of the ocean to anything like the English
                    College of Arms.</p>
            <p>I could spend several hours discussing common misconceptions regarding heraldry, such as the
                    ridiculous explanations of the meanings of the charges, but perhaps what I have said thus far is
                    sufficient for our present project in discouragement.</p>
            <p>The moral underlying all my observations thus far, I think, is that genealogical research is far more
                    than copying. We cannot blindly copy royal ancestral lines because somewhere in a pedigree we come
                    across our surname; and we cannot blindly copy a coat-of-arms because we like the color and the
                    design and the original owner happened to bear our name. And, of course, we cannot possibly compile
                    an accurate family history by the simple act of examining printed books and copying from them
                    whatever materials seem to bear on our supposed family. Genealogy compiled solely from such sources
                    does not deserve the name, yet some self-styled genealogists boast of their success by this means.
                    What is even more unfortunate, their work is frequently printed and is thereby placed within reach
                    of other inexperienced and uncritical workers.</p>
            <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-040-1-087"/>
            <p>It must continually be born in mind by every worker in the field, that no one book, nor, indeed, all
                    the books ever printed, cover all the circumstances surrounding even one member of a family. The
                    searcher must go to original source materials, such as church records, land records, wills, deeds,
                    census records, town records, county court records, probate records, and also to the vital records
                    of the towns concerned in the search.</p>
            <p>The use of such records was touched upon in my earlier paper read before this group, and there are so
                    many excellent guides to their use-Gilbert H. Doane, Donald L. Jacobus, and Henry R. Stiles among
                    them-that there is no need to develop the subject here. What I do wish to emphasize is the training
                    and skill required in their use. Many of these original records exist only in manuscripts,
                    frequently in a seventeenth- or eighteenth-century hand. Special training and practice are needed to
                    decipher such writing, and even skilled persons frequently make mistakes in copying. More and more
                    of these manuscript records are being printed for the benefit of historians; but even such works,
                    which are usually carefully done, contain errors, and the skilled genealogist occasionally finds
                    himself going back to the original manuscript in an attempt to clear up what appears to be a dubious
                    entry in the printed record.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, no one can make intelligent use of such records without a fair knowledge of the
                    contemporary meaning of common terms and phrases. Most of us know, probably, that "cousin" in
                    colonial times meant a nephew or a niece or even a close friend, oftener than it signified the child
                    of one&amp;apos;s aunt or uncle. There are many other terms that mean one thing to us, but meant
                    something quite different to our ancestors.</p>
            <p>In fact, an appellate court decided that the "language and custom of the times" should be used in
                    interpreting old legal documents.</p>
            <p>The genealogist, in short, must develop imagination and historical perspective. He must examine his
                    materials in the light of contemporary circumstances, which means that he must be aware of economic
                    conditions, of social customs, and of political and religious beliefs in the area under study.
                    Lacking such knowledge, the careful genealogist will consult with a person having the required
                    information before proceeding <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-040-1-088"/> too far with his work. I know of
                    one more or less celebrated genealogical problem which baffled some of our best professionals for
                    more than one hundred years. The case involved the complete disappearance from the records of a man
                    who had been a successful shipbuilder in his community. Everyone who tackled the problem ended up by
                    assuming that the man had suffered financial reverses and had deliberately retired to obscurity. One
                    professional, however, an acquaintance of mine, reasoned that a man who had shown so much initiative
                    would probably look about for a town where the shipbuilding business was booming and would transfer
                    his interests to that place. Accordingly, this genealogist studied the economic history of the time,
                    and chose for further investigation a town whose shipping industries began to flourish about the
                    time of our shipbuilder&amp;apos;s mysterious disappearance. He had not worked very long before
                    he turned up a complete and well-documented history of his man&amp;apos;s very successful career
                    in the new location, including his will which had been sought for more than a century.</p>
            <p>I have said enough, I think, to emphasize my point that true genealogical research is something more
                    than casual notetaking.</p>
            <p>The care, skill, and actual labor required in compiling a dependable genealogy are beyond the
                    comprehension of anyone who has not done it. Every item which comes up for consideration must be
                    weighed in the light of possibility, probability, and surety from the various viewpoints of history,
                    geography, physiology, logic, and the other sciences. Any material that can pass these tests may be
                    included. Any that cannot must be excluded. The person who knows how to make these tests and
                    exercise this care, and only such person, may properly be called a genealogist.</p>
            <p>Stiles summed it all up in two paragraphs when he wrote, back in 1899: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The requirements of genealogy are: First, an "eye single to the truth"; second, a power of
                            sharp, clear and logical statement of facts, a methodical way of sifting, collating and
                            arranging them, a capacity of seeing and using the deductions which arise from them, and,
                            particularly, caution against a too ready reception of all sources of information; third,
                            the true genealogist should eminently possess, both from nature and practice, the judicial
                            cast of mind, holding his judgment in such perfect equipoise that it cannot be easily swayed
                            by personal prejudices or extraneous influences; fourth, above all, the characteristic which
                                <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-040-1-089"/> distinguished the best genealogist is, what has been
                            happily described as "a relentless objectivity in the pursuit of
                            facts….&amp;quot;</p>
                        <p>The opinions of the genealogist should be so carefully based on facts, and so fortified by
                            references and authorities, that his every statement should have the weight and value of a
                            solemn affirmation.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, in spite of careful training and conscientious effort, some professional genealogists make
                    errors. I have in mind one case where evidence was sought to confirm the relationship of certain
                    persons. After some search a will was found naming all the persons in the problem. The report was
                    prepared and ready to deliver, when the genealogist thought of one more source of information. He
                    procured a census record and learned to his surprise that the will did not fit his problem, because
                    it was made by the son of the man being studied. By a curious circumstance all the members of the
                    two families bore the same names.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most famous error in recent times concerns the account of the kinship of President
                    Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and General Douglas McArthur. It was definitely stated
                    that both Mr. Churchill and President Roosevelt descended from John Cooke, who came in the
                    "Mayflower,&amp;quot; and his wife, Sarah <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>, the daughter of Mr. Richard Warren, who also came in the "Mayflower.&amp;quot;
                    This account was widely accepted as a record of kinship which would more closely unite our country
                    with Great Britain in this time of stress.</p>
            <p>The compiler of the article, unfortunately, had not found a most pertinent record. Mr. Churchill
                    descends from a Daniel Wilcox, Sr., who married not just once, but twice, and the second wife was a
                    daughter of John Cooke, of the "Mayflower.&amp;quot; But it was the first wife, name unknown,
                    who was Mr. Churchill&amp;apos;s ancestor, as the document proves, hence he is not related to
                    President Roosevelt on this line.</p>
            <p>This is just another example of not searching far enough.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the ultimate in careful genealogy is that used in legal cases. Each item, each date, each
                    place, and each relationship must be established by a recognized and accepted legal document. In
                    contests over some estates, not just one record, but as many as five or six legal records are used
                    to prove a point. Thus, in addition to a birth record, a marriage <list type="footnotes">

                    would be amply sufficient to establish the fact, the technicalities of the particular lawsuit may
                    require a deed or two, a will or two, a court record, and perhaps a census record. The aim, in legal
                    cases, is to prove the relationship beyond any possibility of contradiction. Such work really
                    constitutes not only careful genealogy, but also scientific genealogy.</p>
            <p>It is not my intention to insist that all my listeners become
                    &amp;quote;legal-genealogists,&amp;quot; but it is my intention to point out that the skill
                    and care used in legal cases should, sooner or later, be applied to every compilation. Then, and
                    only then, will we have the family history on which we can depend, and of which we will always be
                    proud.</p>

                    some later date. The writing in this copy is more difficult to read than that of the original; a few
                    marriages were omitted in the former and four pages of names that appear in Marriage Book A, March,
                    1817, through July, 1830, were included. Each has an index. These indexes and the copy were used for

                    quoting references, in ordering certified copies from the county, or in requesting photoprints from
                    the microfilm copy. Attention should be called to the explanation of the index for the numbering of
                    pages 4a, 4b, 5a, and 5b.</p>
            <p>Several of the names have been checked with histories of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName>, the 1810 list of taxpayers of the county on file in the William Henry Smith Memorial
                    Library., and the 1820 and 1830 photostats of the census on file in the Genealogy Division of the
                    State Library. Although an attempt has been made to spell the names exactly as written in the
                    original volume, several variants have been suggested in the index. Even with this care it is
                    possible that some one with an ancestor by the name of Ashby may find it transcribed as Ashley.
                    Phonetic spelling must always be taken into consideration. The letter "S" often proves a stumbling
                    block; hence the question mark after the name of Leany in the index. Owen Seany, Sr., came from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1809.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no way in which to explain the apparent discrepancy, unless there were two people of the
                    same name, in the marriages of Polly Resbuk (or Resbuck) to David Fisher in 1811 and to Benjamin
                    Fisher in 1812. She could not have been a widow in 1812 since David Fisher married Betsy Hodges in
                    1815. The name Resbuk is puzzling in itself, inasmuch as no clue has been found of a family of that
                    name in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName>. It is barely possible that Resbuk is intended for Railsback since that was a prominent
                    family name there. The marriages of three different couples are recorded twice in the volume. There
                    may have been two women by the name of Sally Shortridge since there are two marriages recorded under
                    this name to two different men listed in 1816.</p>
