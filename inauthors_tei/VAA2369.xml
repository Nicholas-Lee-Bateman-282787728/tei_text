                        &amp; Norman, corporation lawyers, there drifted on a December afternoon
                        a girl in search of work at stenography and typewriting. The firm was about
                        the most important and most famousradical orators often said infamousin New
                        York. The girl seemed, at a glance, about as unimportant and obscure an atom
                        as the city hid in its vast ferment. She was blondetawny hair, fair skin,
                        blue eyes. Aside from this hardly conclusive mark of identity there was
                        nothing positive, nothing definite, about her. She was neither tall nor
                        short, neither fat nor thin, neither grave nor gay. She gave the impression
                        of a young person of the feminine genderthat, and nothing more. She was
                        plainly dressed, like thousands of other girls, in darkish blue jacket and
                        skirt and white shirt waist. Her boots and gloves were neat, her hair simply
                        and well arranged. Perhaps in these respectsin neatness and tasteshe did
                        excel the average, which is depressingly low. But in a city where more or
                        less strikingly pretty women, bent upon being seen, are as plentiful as the
                        blackberries of Kentucky&apos;s Julyin New York no one would <pb
                            id="VAA2369-005" n="2"/> have given her a second look, this quiet young
                        woman screened in an atmosphere of self-effacement.</p>
                    <p>She applied to the head clerk. It so happened that need for another
                        typewriter had just arisen. She got a trial, showed enough skill to warrant
                        the modest wage of ten dollars a week; she became part of the office force
                        of twenty or twenty-five young men and women similarly employed. As her lack
                        of skill was compensated by industry and regularity, she would have a job so
                        long as business did not slacken. When it did, she would be among the first
                        to be let go. She shrank into her obscure niche in the great firm, came and
                        went in mouse-like fashion, said little, obtruded herself never, was all but
                        forgotten.</p>
                    <p>Nothing could have been more commonplace, more trivial than the whole
                        incident. The name of the girl was HallowellMiss Hallowell. On the chief
                        clerk&apos;s pay roll appeared the additional information that her first
                        name was Dorothea. The head office boy, in one of his occasional spells of
                        &quot;freshness,&quot; addressed her as Miss Dottie. She looked at
                        him with a puzzled expression; it presently changed to a slight, sweet
                        smile, and she went about her business. There was no rebuke in her manner;
                        she was far too self-effacing for anything so positive as the mildest
                        rebuke. But the head office boy blushed awkwardlywhy he did not know and
                        could not discover, though he often cogitated upon it. She remained Miss
                        Hallowell.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-006" n="3"/>
                    <p>Opposites suggest each other. The dimmest personality in those offices was
                        the girl whose name imaged to everyone little more than a pencil, notebook,
                        and typewriting machine. The vividest personality was Frederick Norman. In
                        the list of names upon the outer doors of the firm&apos;s vast
                        labyrinthine suite, on the seventeenth floor of the Syndicate Building, his
                        name came lastand, in the newest lettering, suggesting recentness of
                        partnership. In age he was the youngest of the partners. Lockyer was
                        archaic, Sanders an antique; Benchley, actually only about fifty-five, had
                        the air of one born in the grandfather class. Lockyer the son dyed his hair
                        and affected jauntiness, but was in fact not many years younger than
                        Benchley and had the stiffening jerky legs of one paying for a lively youth.
                        (Norman was thirty-sevenat the age the Greeks extolled as divine because it
                        means all the best of youth combined with all the best of manhood.) Some
                        people thought Norman younger, almost boyish. Those knew him uptown only,
                        where he hid the man of affairs beneath the man of the
                        world-that-amuses-itself. Some people thought he looked, and was, older than
                        the age with which the biographical notices credited him. They knew him down
                        town onlywhere he dominated by sheer force of intellect and will.</p>
                    <p>As has been said, the firm ranked among the greatest in New York. It was a
                        trusted counselor in large affairscommercial, financial, politicalin all
                        parts of <pb id="VAA2369-007" n="4"/> America, in all parts of the globe,
                        for many of its clients were international traffickers. Yet this young man,
                        this youngest and most recent of the partners, had within the month forced a
                        reorganization of the firmor, rather, of its profitson a basis that gave him
                        no less than one half of the whole.</p>
                    <p>His demand threw his four associates into paroxysms of rage and fearthe fear
                        serving as a wholesome antidote to the rage.</p>
                    <p>It certainly was infuriating that a youth, admitted to partnership barely
                        three years ago, should thus maltreat his associates. Ingrate was precisely
                        the epithet for him. At least, so they honestly thought, after the quaint
                        human fashion; for, because they had given him the partnership, they looked
                        on themselves as his benefactors, and neglected as unimportant detail the
                        sole and entirely selfish reason for their graciousness. But enraged though
                        these worthy gentlemen were, and eagerly though they longed to treat the
                        &quot;conceited and grasping upstart&quot; as he richly deserved,
                        they accepted his ultimatum. Even the venerable and venerated Lockyerthan
                        whom a more convinced self-deceiver on the subject of his own virtues never
                        wore white whiskers, black garments, and the other badges of eminent
                        respectabilityeven old Joseph Lockyer could not twist the acceptance into
                        another manifestation of the benevolence of himself and his associates. They
                        had to stare the grimacing truth straight in the <pb id="VAA2369-008" n="5"
                        /> face; they were yielding because they dared not refuse. To refuse would
                        mean the departure of Norman with the firm&apos;s most profitable
                        business. It costs heavily to live in New York; the families of successful
                        men are extravagant; so conduct unbecoming a gentleman may not there be
                        resented if to resent is to cut down one&apos;s income. The time was, as
                        the dignified and nicely honorable Sanders observed, when these and many
                        similar low standards did not prevail in the legal profession. But such is
                        the frailty of human natureor so savage the pressure of the need of the
                        material necessities of civilized life, let a profession become profitable
                        or develop possibilities of profiteven the profession of statesman, even
                        that of lawyeror doctoror priestor wifeand straightway it begins to tumble
                        down toward the brawl and stew of the market place.</p>
                    <p>In a last effort to rouse the gentleman in Norman or to shame him into
                        pretense of gentlemanliness, Lockyer expostulated with him like a prophet
                        priest in full panoply of saintly virtue. And Lockyer was passing good at
                        that exalted gesture. He was a Websterian figure, with the venality of the
                        great Daniel in all its pompous dignity modernizedand correspondingly
                        expanded. He abounded in those idealist sonorosities that are the
                        stock-in-trade of all solemn old-fashioned frauds. The young man listened
                        with his wonted attentive courtesy until the dolorous appeal disguised as
                        fatherly counsel came to an end. Then in his blue-gray eyes <pb
                            id="VAA2369-009" n="6"/> appeared the gleam that revealed the tenacity
                        and the penetration of his mind. He said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Lockyer, you have been absent six yearsexcept an occasional two
                        or three weeksabsent as American Ambassador to France. You have done nothing
                        for the firm in that time. Yet you have not scorned to take profits you did
                        not earn. Why should I scorn to take profits I do earn?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lockyer shook his picturesque head in sad remonstrance at this vulgar,
                        coarse, but latterly frequent retort of insurgent democracy upon indignant
                        aristocracy. But he answered nothing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Also,&quot; proceeded the graceless youth in the clear and
                        concise way that won the instant attention of juries and judges,
                        &quot;also, our profession is no longer a profession but a
                        business.&quot; His humorous eyes twinkled merrily. &quot;It divides
                        into two partsteaching capitalists how to loot without being caught, and
                        teaching them how to get off if by chance they have been caught. There are
                        other branches of the profession, but they&apos;re not lucrative, so <hi
                            rend="i">we</hi> do not practice them. Do I make myself clear?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lockyer again shook his head and sighed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not an Utopian,&quot; continued young Norman.
                        &quot;Law and custom permitnot to say sanctifyour sort of business. SoI
                        do my best. But I shall not conceal from you that it&apos;s distasteful
                        to me. I wish to get out of it. I shall get out as soon as I&apos;ve
                        made enough <pb id="VAA2369-010" n="7"/> capital to assure me the income I
                        have and need. Naturally, I wish to gather in the necessary amount as
                        speedily as possible.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fred, my boy, I regret that you take such low views of our noble
                        profession.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesas a profession it is noble. But not as a practice. <hi rend="i"
                            >My</hi> regret is that it invites and compels such low views.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will look at these things moremore mellowly when you are
                        older.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I doubt if I&apos;ll ever rise very high in the art of
                        self-deception,&quot; replied Norman. &quot;If I&apos;d had any
                        bent that way I&apos;d not have got so far so quickly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was a boastful remarkof a kind he, and other similar young men, have the
                        habit of making. But from him it did not sound boastfulsimply a frank and
                        timely expression of an indisputable truth, which indeed it was. Once more
                        Mr. Lockyer sighed. &quot;I see you are incorrigible,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have not acted without reflection,&quot; said Norman.</p>
                    <p>And Lockyer knew that to persist was simply to endanger his dignity.
                        &quot;I am getting old,&quot; said he. &quot;Indeed, I <hi
                            rend="i">am</hi> old. I have gotten into the habit of leaning on you, my
                        boy. I can&apos;t consent to your going, hard though you make it for us
                        to keep you. I shall try to persuade our colleagues to accept your
                        terms.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman showed neither appreciation nor triumph. He merely bowed slightly. And
                        so the matter was <pb id="VAA2369-011" n="8"/> settled. Instead of moving
                        into the suite of offices in the Mills Building on which he had taken an
                        option, young Norman remained where he had been toiling for twelve years.</p>
                    <p>After this specimen of Norman&apos;s quality, no one will be surprised to
                        learn that in figure he was one of those solidly built men of medium height
                        who look as if they were made to sustain and to deliver shocks, to bear up
                        easily under heavy burdens; or that his head thickly covered with fairish
                        hair, was hatchet-shaped with the helve or face suggesting that while it
                        could and would cleave any obstacle, it would wear a merry if somewhat
                        sardonic smile the while. No one had ever seen Norman angry, though a few
                        persevering offenders against what he regarded as his rights had felt the
                        results of swift and powerful action of the same sort that is usually
                        accompaniedand weakenedby outward show of anger. Invariably good-humored, he
                        was soon seen to be more dangerous than the men of flaring temper. In most
                        instances good humor of this unbreakable species issues from weakness, from
                        a desire to conciliateusually with a view to plucking the more easily.
                        Norman&apos;s good humor arose from a sense of absolute security which
                        in turn was the product of confidence in himself and amiable disdain for his
                        fellow men. The masses he held in derision for permitting the classes to
                        rule and rob and spit upon them. The classes he scorned for caring to occupy
                        themselves with so cheap <pb id="VAA2369-012" n="9"/> and sordid a game as
                        the ruling, robbing, and spitting aforesaid. Coming down to the specific, he
                        despised men as individuals because he had always found in each and everyone
                        of them a weakness that made it easy for him to use them as he pleased.</p>
                    <p>Not an altogether pleasant character, this. But not so unpleasant as it may
                        seem to those unable impartially to analyze human character, even their
                        ownespecially their own. And let anyone who is disposed to condemn Norman
                        first look within himselfin some less hypocritical and self-deceiving
                        moment, if he have such momentsand let him note what are the qualities he
                        relies upon and uses in his own struggle to save himself from being
                        submerged and sunk. Further, there were in Norman many agreeable qualities,
                        important, but less fundamental, therefore less deep-hiddentherefore
                        generally regarded as the real man and as the cause of his success in which
                        they in fact had almost no part. He was, for example, of striking physical
                        appearance, was attractively dressed and mannered, was prodigally generous.
                        Neither as lawyer nor as man did he practice justice. But while as lawyer he
                        practiced injustice, as man he practiced mercy. Whenever a weakling appealed
                        to him for protection, he gave itat times with splendid recklessness as to
                        the cost to himself in antagonisms and enmities. Indeed, so great were the
                        generosities of his character that, had he not been arrogant, disdainful,
                        self-confident, resolutely <pb id="VAA2369-013" n="10"/> and
                        single-heartedly ambitious, he must inevitably have ruined himselfif he had
                        ever been able to rise high enough to be worthy the dignity of catastrophe.</p>
                    <p>Successful men are usually trying persons to know well. Lambs, asses, and
                        chickens do not associate happily with lions, wolves, and hawksnor do birds
                        and beasts of prey get on well with one another. Norman was regarded as
                        &quot;difficult&quot; by his friendsby those of them who happened to
                        get into the path of his ambition, in front of instead of behind him, and by
                        those who fell into the not unnatural error of misunderstanding his good
                        nature and presuming upon it. His clients regarded him as insolent. The big
                        businesses, seeking the rich spoils of commerce, frequent highly perilous
                        waters. They need skillful pilots. Usually these lawyer-pilots
                        &quot;know their place&quot; and put on no airs upon the
                        quarter-deck while they are temporarily in command. Not so Norman. He took
                        the full rank, authorityand emolumentsof commander. And as his power, fame,
                        and income were swiftly growing, it is fair to assume that he knew what he
                        was about.</p>
                    <p>He was admiredextravagantly admiredby young men with not too broad a vein of
                        envy. He was no woman hateranything but that. Indeed, those who wished him
                        ill had from time to time hoped to see him tumble down, through
                        miscalculation in some of his audacities with women. Nohe did not hate
                        women. <pb id="VAA2369-014" n="11"/> But there were several women who hated
                        himor tried to; and if wounded vanity and baffled machination be admitted as
                        just causes for hatred, they had cause. He likedbut he did not wholly trust.
                        When he went to sleep, it was not where Delilah could wield the shears. A
                        most irritating prudenceirritating to friends and intimates of all degrees
                        and kinds, in a race of beings with a mania for being trusted implicitly but
                        with no balancing mania for deserving trust of the implicit variety.</p>
                    <p>And he ate hugelyand whatever he pleased. He could drink beyond belief, all
                        sorts of things, with no apparent ill effect upon either body or brain. He
                        had all the appetites developed abnormally, and abnormal capacity for
                        gratifying them. Where there was one man who envied him his eminence, there
                        were a dozen who envied him his physical capacities. We cannot live and act
                        without doing mischief, as well as that which most of us would rather do,
                        provided that in the doing we are not ourselves undone. Probably in no
                        direction did Norman do so much mischief as in unconsciously leading men of
                        his sets down town and up to imitate his colossal dissipationswhich were not
                        dissipation for him who was abnormal.</p>
                    <p>Withal, he was a monster for work. There is not much truth in men&apos;s
                        unending talk of how hard they work or are worked. The ravages from their
                        indulgences in smoking, drinking, gallantry, eating too much <pb
                            id="VAA2369-015" n="12"/> and too fast and too often, have to be
                        explained away creditably, to themselves and to othersnotably to the wives
                        or mothers who nurse them and suffer from their diminishing incomes. Hence
                        the wailing about work. But once in a while a real worker appearsa man with
                        enormous ingenuity at devising difficult tasks for himself and with enormous
                        persistence in doing them. Frederick Norman was one of these blue-moon
                        prodigies.</p>
                    <p>Obviously, such a man could not but be observed and talked about. Endless
                        stories, some of them more or less true, most of them apocryphal, were told
                        of himstories of his shrewd, unexpected moves in big cases, of his witty
                        retorts, of his generosities, of his peculiarities of dress, of eating and
                        drinking; stories of his adventures with women. Whatever he did, however
                        trivial, took color and charm from his personality, so easy yet so
                        difficult, so simple yet so complex, so baffling. Was he wholly selfish? Was
                        he a friend to almost anybody or to nobody? Did he ever love? No one knew,
                        not even himself, for life interested him too intensely and too incessantly
                        to leave him time for self-analysis. One thing he was certain of; he hated
                        nobody, envied nobody. He was too successful for that.</p>
                    <p>He did as he pleased. And, on the whole, he pleased to do far less
                        inconsiderately than his desires, his abilities, and his opportunities
                        tempted. Have not men been acclaimed good for less?</p>
                    <p>In the offices, where he was canvased daily by partners, <pb id="VAA2369-016"
                            n="13"/> clerks, everyone down to the cleaners whose labors he so often
                        delayed, opinion varied from day to day. They worshiped him; they hated him.
                        They loved him; they feared him. They regarded him as more than human, as
                        less than human; but never as just humanthough always as endowed with fine
                        human virtues and even finer human weaknesses. Miss Tillotson, next to the
                        head clerk in rank and payand a pretty and pushing young persondreamed of
                        getting acquainted with himreally well acquainted. It was a vain dream. For
                        him, between up town and down town a great gulf- was fixed. Also, he had no
                        interest in or ammunition for sparrows.</p>
                    <p>It was in December that Miss HallowellMiss Dorothea Hallowellgot her
                        temporary place at ten dollars a weekthat obscure event, somewhat like a
                        field mouse taking quarters in a horizon-bounded grain field. It was not
                        until mid-February that she, the palest of personalities, came into direct
                        contact with Norman, about the most refulgent. This is how it happened.</p>
                    <p>Late in that February afternoon, an hour or more after the last of the office
                        force should have left, Norman threw open the door of his private office and
                        glanced round at the rows on rows of desks. The lights in the big room were
                        on, apparently only because he was still within. With an exclamation of
                        disappointment he turned to renter his office. He heard the click of
                        typewriter <pb id="VAA2369-017" n="14"/> keys. Again he looked round, but
                        could see no one.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t there some one here?&quot; he cried.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t I hear a typewriter?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The noise stopped. There was a slight rustling from a far corner, beyond his
                        view, and presently he saw advancing a slim and shrinking slip of a girl
                        with a face that impressed him only as small and insignificant. In a quiet
                        little voice she said, &quot;Yes, sir. Do you wish anything?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, what are you doing here?&quot; he asked. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen you before.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. I took dictation from you several times,&quot; veplied
                        she.</p>
                    <p>He was instantly afraid he might have hurt her feelings, and he, who in the
                        days when he was far, far less than now, had often suffered from that
                        commonplace form of brutality, was most careful not to commit it.
                        &quot;I never know what&apos;s going on round me when I&apos;m
                        thinking,&quot; explained he, though he was saying to himself that the
                        next time he would probably again be unable to remember one with nothing
                        distinctive to fix identity. &quot;You areMiss?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Hallowell.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you happen to be here? I&apos;ve given particular
                        instructions that no one is ever to be detained after hours.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A little color appeared in the pale, small faceand <pb id="VAA2369-018"
                            n="15"/> now he saw that she had a singularly fair and smooth skin,
                        singularly beautifuland he wondered why he had not noticed it before. Being
                        a close observer, he had long ago noted and learned to appreciate the
                        wonders of that most amazing of tissues, the human skin; and he had come to
                        be a connoisseur. &quot;I&apos;m staying of my own accord,&quot;
                        said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They ought not to give you so much work,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll speak about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Into the small face came the look of the frightened childa fascinating look.
                        And suddenly he saw that she had lovely eyes, clear, expressive, innocent.
                        &quot;Please don&apos;t,&quot; she pleaded, in the gentle quiet
                        voice. &quot;It isn&apos;t overwork. I did a brief so badly that I
                        was ashamed to hand it in. I&apos;m doing it again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He laughed, and a fine frank laugh he had when he was in the mood. At once a
                        smile lighted up her face, danced in her eyes, hovered bewitchingly about
                        her lipsand he wondered why he had not at first glance noted how sweet and
                        charmingly fresh her mouth was. &quot;Why, she&apos;s
                        beautiful,&quot; he said to himself, the manly man&apos;s inevitable
                        interest in feminine charm wide awake. &quot;Really beautiful. If she
                        had a figureand were tall&quot; As he thought thus, he glanced at her
                        figure. A figure? Tall? She certainly was tallno, she wasn&apos;tyes,
                        she was. No, not tall from head to foot, but with the most captivating long
                        lineslong throat, long bust, long arms, long in body and in legs <pb
                            id="VAA2369-019" n="16"/> long and slenderyet somehow not tall. Heall
                        this took but an instantreturned his glance to her face. He was startled.
                        The beauty had fled, leaving not a trace behind. Before him wavered once
                        more a small insignificance. Even her skin now seemed commonplace.</p>
                    <p>She was saying, &quot;Did you wish me to do something?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesa letter. Come in,&quot; he said abruptly.</p>
                    <p>Once more the business in hand took possession of his mind. He became
                        unconscious of her presence. He dictated slowly, carefully choosing his
                        words, for perhaps a quarter of an hour. Then he stopped and paced up and
                        down, revolving a new idea, a new phase of the business, that had flashed
                        upon him. When he had his thoughts once more in form he turned toward the
                        girl, the mere machine. He gazed at her in amazement. When he had last
                        looked, he had seen an uninteresting nonentity. But that was not this
                        person, seated before him in the same garments and with the same general
                        blondness. That person had been a girl. This time the transformation was not
                        into the sweet innocence of lovely childhood, but into something incredibly
                        different. He was gazing now at a woman, a beautiful world-weary woman, one
                        who had known the joys and then the sorrows of life and love. Heavy were the
                        lids of the large eyes gazing mournfully into infinitygazing upon the graves
                        of a life, the long, long vista of buried joys. Never had he seen anything
                        so sad or so lovely <pb id="VAA2369-020" n="17"/> as her mouth. The soft,
                        smooth skin was not merely pale; its pallor was that of wakeful nights, of
                        weeping until there were no more tears to drain away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Hallowell&quot; he began.</p>
                    <p>She startled; and like the flight of an interrupted dream, the woman he had
                        been seeing vanished. There sat the commonplace young person he had first
                        seen. He said to himself: &quot;I must be a little off my base
                        to-night,&quot; and went on with the dictation. When he finished she
                        withdrew to transcribe the letter on the typewriter. He seated himself at
                        his desk and plunged into the masses of documents. He lost the sense of his
                        surroundings until she stood beside him holding the typewritten pages. He
                        did not glance up, but seized the sheets to read and sign.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You may go,&quot; said he. &quot;I am very much obliged to
                        you.&quot; And he contrived, as always, to put a suggestion of
                        genuineness into the customary phrase.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s not good work,&quot; said
                        she. &quot;I&apos;ll wait to see if I am to do any of it
                        over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, thank you,&quot; said he. And he looked upto find himself
                        gazing at still another person, wholly different from any he had seen
                        before. The others had all been womenwomanly women, full of the weakness,
                        the delicateness rather, that distinguishes the feminine. This woman he was
                        looking at now had a look of strength. He had thought her frail. He was
                        seeing a strong womana splendidly healthy body, with sinews <pb
                            id="VAA2369-021" n="18"/> of steel most gracefully covered by that fair
                        smooth skin of hers. And her features, toowhy, this girl was a person of
                        character, of will.</p>
                    <p>He glanced through the pages. &quot;All rightthank you,&quot; he said
                        hastily. &quot;Please don&apos;t stay any longer. Leave the other
                        thing till to-morrow.&quot;</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l>&quot;Noit has to be done to-night.&quot;</l>
                        <l>&quot;But I insist upon your going.&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>She hesitated, said quietly, &quot;Very well,&quot; and turned to go.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you mustn&apos;t do it at home, either.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She made no reply, but waited respectfully until it was evident he wished to
                        say no more, then went out. He bundled together his papers, sealed and
                        stamped and addressed his letter, put on his overcoat and hat and crossed
                        the outer office on his way to the door. It was empty; she was gone. He
                        descended in the elevator to the street, remembered that he had not locked
                        one of his private cases, returned. As he opened the outer door he heard the
                        sound of typewriter keys. In the corner, the obscure, sheltered corner, sat
                        the girl, bent with childlike gravity over her typewriter. It was an amusing
                        and a touching sightshe looked so young and so solemnly in earnest.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t I tell you to go home?&quot; he called out,
                        with mock sternness.</p>
                    <p>Up she sprang, her hand upon her heart. And once more she was beautiful, but
                        once more it was in a way <pb id="VAA2369-022" n="[19]"/> startlingly,
                        unbelievably different from any expression he had seen before.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, really, Miss&quot; He had forgotten her name.
                        &quot;You must not stay on here. We aren&apos;t such slave drivers
                        as all that. Go home, please. I&apos;ll take the
                        responsibility.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She had recovered her equanimity. In her quiet, gentle voicebut it no longer
                        sounded weak or insignificantshe said, &quot;You are very kind, Mr.
                        Norman. But I must finish my work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Haven&apos;t I said I&apos;d take the blame?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you can&apos;t,&quot; replied she. &quot;I work
                        badly. I seem to learn slowly. If I fall behind, I shall lose my placesooner
                        or later. It was that way with the last place I had. If you interfered,
                        you&apos;d only injure me. I&apos;ve had experience. AndI must not
                        lose my place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>One of the scrub women thrust her mussy head and ragged, shapeless body in at
                        the door. With a start Norman awoke to the absurdity of his situationand to
                        the fact that he was placing the girl in a compromising position. He
                        shrugged his shoulders, went in and locked the cabinet, departed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a queer little insignificance she is!&quot; thought he,
                        and dismissed her from mind.</p>

                        its ignorance and its optimism, devises to change life from a pleasant
                        journey along a plain road into a fumbling and stumbling and struggling
                        about in a fog. Of these hallucinations the most grotesque is that the weak
                        can come together, can pass a law to curb the strong, can set one of their
                        number to enforce it, may then disperse with no occasion further to trouble
                        about the strong. Every line of every page of history tells how the
                        strongthe nimble-witted, the farsighted, the ambitioushave worked their will
                        upon their feebler and less purposeful fellow men, regardless of any and all
                        precautions to the contrary. Conditions have improved only because the
                        number of the strong has increased. With so many lions at war with each
                        other not a few rabbits contrive to avoid perishing in the nest.</p>
                    <p>Norman&apos;s genius lay in ability to take away from an adversary the
                        legal weapons implicitly relied upon and to arm his client with them. No man
                        understood better than he the abysmal distinction between law and justice;
                        no man knew better than he how to compel <pb id="VAA2369-024" n="21"/> or to
                        assistcourts to apply the law, so just in the general, to promoting
                        injustice in the particular. And whenever he permitted conscience a voice in
                        his internal debatesit was not oftenhe heard from it its usual servile
                        approbation: How can the reign of justice be more speedily brought about
                        than by making the reign of lawlawyer lawintolerable?</p>
                    <p>About a fortnight after the trifling incident related in the previous
                        chapter, Norman had to devise a secret agreement among several of the most
                        eminent of his clients. They wished to band together, to do a thing
                        expressly forbidden by the law; they wished to conspire to lower wages and
                        raise prices in several railway systems under their control. But none would
                        trust the others; so there must be something in writing, laid away in a
                        secret safety deposit box along with sundry bundles of securities put up as
                        forfeit, all in the custody of Norman. When he had worked out in his mind
                        and in fragmentary notes the details of their agreement, he was ready for
                        some one to do the clerical work. The some one must be absolutely
                        trustworthy, as the plain language of the agreement would make clear to the
                        dullest mind dazzling opportunities for profitnot only in stock jobbing but
                        also in blackmail. He rang for Tetlow, the head clerk. Tetlowsmooth and sly
                        and smug, lacking only courageous initiative to make him a great lawyer,
                        but, lacking that, lacking allTetlow entered and closed the door behind him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-025" n="22"/>
                    <p>Norman leaned back in his desk chair and laced his fingers behind his head.
                        &quot;One of your typewriters is a slight blonde girlsits in the corner
                        to the far leftif she&apos;s still here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Hallowell,&quot; said Tetlow. &quot;We are letting her
                        go at the end of this week. She&apos;s nice and ladylike, and willingin
                        fact, most anxious to please. But the work&apos;s too difficult for her.
                        She&apos;s ratherratherwell, not exactly stupid, but slow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Um,&quot; said Norman reflectively. &quot;There&apos;s
                        Miss Bostwickperhaps she&apos;ll do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Bostwick got married last week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman smiled. He remembered the girl because she was the oldest and
                        homeliest in the office. &quot;There&apos;s somebody for
                        everybodyeh, Tetlow?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He was a lighthouse keeper,&quot; said Tetlow.
                        &quot;There&apos;s a story that he advertised for a wife. But that
                        may be a joke.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not that MissMiss Halloway?&quot; mused Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Hallowell,&quot; corrected Tetlow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hallowellyes. Is she<hi rend="i">very</hi> incompetent?</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not exactly that. But business is slackeningand she&apos;s been
                        only temporaryand&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman cut him off with, &quot;Send her in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t wish her dismissed? I haven&apos;t told her
                        yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;m not interfering in your department. Do <pb
                            id="VAA2369-026" n="23"/> as you like.... Noin this caselet her stay on
                        for the present.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can use her,&quot; said Tetlow. &quot;And she gets only
                        ten a week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman frowned. He did not like to <hi rend="i">hear</hi> that an
                        establishment in which he had control paid less than decent living wageseven
                        if the market price did excuseyes, compel it. &quot;Send her
                        in,&quot; he repeated. Then, as Tetlow was about to leave, &quot;She
                        is trustworthy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All our force is. I see to that, Mr. Norman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Has she a young mansteady company, I think they call it?&quot;
                        &quot;She has no friends at all. She&apos;s extremely shyat least,
                        reserved. Lives with her father, an old crank of an analytical chemist over
                        in Jersey City. She hasn&apos;t even a lady friend.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, send her in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A moment later Norman, looking up from his work, saw the dim slim nonentity
                        before him. Again he leaned back and, as he talked with her, studied her
                        face to make sure that his first judgment was correct. &quot;Do you stay
                        late every night?&quot; asked he smilingly.</p>
                    <p>She colored a little, but enough to bring out the exquisite fineness of her
                        white skin. &quot;Oh, I don&apos;t mind,&quot; said she, and
                        there was no embarrassment in her manner. &quot;I&apos;ve got to
                        learnand doing things over helps.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-027" n="24"/>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing equal to it,&quot; declared Norman.
                        &quot;You&apos;ve been to school?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Only six weeks,&quot; confessed she. &quot;I
                        couldn&apos;t afford to stay longer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean the other sort of schoolnot the typewriting.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh! Yes,&quot; said she. And once more he saw that
                        extraordinary transformation. She became all in an instant delicately,
                        deliciously lovely, with the moving, in a way pathetic loveliness of sweet
                        children and sweet flowers. Her look was mystery; but not a mystery of
                        guile. She evidently did not wish to have her past brought to view; but it
                        was equally apparent that behind it lay hid nothing shameful, only the sad,
                        perhaps the painful. Of all the periods of life youth is the best fitted to
                        bear deep sorrows, for then the spirit has its full measure of elasticity.
                        Yet a shadow upon youth is always more moving than the shadows of maturer
                        yearsthose shadows that do not lie upon the surface but are heavy and
                        corroding stains. When Norman saw this shadow upon her youth, so
                        immature-looking, so helpless-looking, he felt the first impulse of genuine
                        interest in her. Perhaps, had that shadow happened to fall when he was
                        seeing her as the commonplace and colorless little struggler for bread, and
                        seeming doomed speedily to be worsted in the struggleperhaps, he would have
                        felt no interest, but only the brief qualm of pity that we dare not
                        encourage in ourselves, on a <pb id="VAA2369-028" n="25"/> journey so beset
                        with hopeless pitiful things as is the journey through life.</p>
                    <p>But he had no impulse to question her. And with some surprise he noted that
                        his reason for refraining was not the usual reasonunwillingness uselessly to
                        add to one&apos;s own burdens by inviting the mournful confidences of
                        another. No, he checked himself because in the manner of this frail and
                        mouselike creature, dim though she once more was, there appeared a dignity,
                        a reserve, that made intrusion curiously impossible. With an apologetic note
                        in his voicea kind and friendly voicehe said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please have your typewriter brought in here. I want you to do some
                        work for mework that isn&apos;t to be spoken ofnot even to Mr.
                        Tetlow.&quot; He looked at her with grave penetrating eyes.
                        &quot;You will not speak of it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied she, and nothing more. But she accompanied
                        the simple negative with a clear and honest sincerity of the eyes that set
                        his mind completely at rest. He felt that this girl had never in her life
                        told a real lie.</p>
                    <p>One of the office boys installed the typewriter, and presently Norman and the
                        quiet nebulous girl at whom no one would trouble to look a second time were
                        seated opposite each other with the broad table desk between, he leaning far
                        back in his desk chair, fingers interlocked behind his proud, strong-looking
                        head, she holding <pb id="VAA2369-029" n="26"/> sharpened pencil suspended
                        over the stenographic notebook. Long before she seated herself he had
                        forgotten her except as machine. There followed a troubled hour, as he
                        dictated, ordered erasure, redictated, ordered rereadings, skipped back and
                        forth, in the effort to frame the secret agreement in the fewest and
                        simplest, and least startlingly unlawful, words. At last he leaned forward
                        with the shine of triumph in his eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Read straight through,&quot; he commanded.</p>
                    <p>She read, interrupted occasionally by a sharp order from him to correct some
                        mistake in her notes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Again,&quot; he commanded, when she translated the last of her
                        notes.</p>
                    <p>This time she was not interrupted once. When she ended, he exclaimed:
                        &quot;Good! I don&apos;t see how you did it so well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nor do I,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You say you are only a beginner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t have done it so well for anyone else,&quot;
                        said she. &quot;You aredifferent.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The remark was worded most flatteringly, but it did not sound so. He saw that
                        she did not herself understand what she meant by
                        &quot;different.&quot; <hi rend="i">He</hi> understood, for he knew
                        the difference between the confused and confusing ordinary minds and such an
                        intelligence as his ownsimple, luminous, enlightening all minds, however
                        dark, so long as they were in the light-flooded region around it.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-030" n="27"/>
                    <p>&quot;Have I made the meaning clear?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>He hoped she would reply that he had not, though this would have indicated a
                        partial defeat in the object he hadto put the complex thing so plainly that
                        no one could fail to understand. But she answered, &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He congratulated himself that his overestimate of her ignorance of affairs
                        had not lured him into giving her the names of the parties at interest to
                        transcribe. But did she really understand? To test her, he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you think of it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That it&apos;s wicked,&quot; replied she, without
                        hesitation and in her small, quiet voice.</p>
                    <p>He laughed. In a way this girl, sitting therethis inconsequential and
                        negligible atomtypefied the masses of mankind against whom that secret
                        agreement was directed. They, the feeble and powerless ones, with their
                        necks ever bent under the yoke of the mighty and their feet ever stumbling
                        into the traps of the craftythey, too, would utter an impotent
                        &quot;Wicked!&quot; if they knew. His voice had the note of gentle
                        raillery in it as he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nonot wicked. Just business.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was looking down at her book, her face expressionless. A few moments
                        before he would have said it was an empty face. Now it seemed to him
                        sphynxlike.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just business,&quot; he repeated. &quot;It is going to take
                        money from those who don&apos;t know how to keep or to spend it and give
                        it to those who do know how. The <pb id="VAA2369-031" n="28"/> money will go
                        for building up civilization, instead of for beer and for bargain-trough
                        finery to make working men&apos;s wives and daughters look cheap and
                        nasty.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was silent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, do you understand?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I understand what you said.&quot; She looked at him as she
                        spoke. He wondered how he could have fancied those lack-luster eyes
                        beautiful or capable of expression.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t believe it?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said she. And suddenly in those eyes, gazing now into
                        space, there came the unutterably melancholy lookheavy-lidded from
                        heartache, weary-wise from long, long and bitter, experiences. Yet she still
                        looked younggirlishly youngerbut it was the youthful look the classic Greek
                        sculptors tried to give their young goddessesthe youth without beginning or
                        endyounger than a baby&apos;s, older than the oldest of the sons of men.
                        He mocked himself for the fancies this queer creature inspired in him; but
                        she none the less made him uneasy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t believe it?&quot; he repeated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she answered again. &quot;My father has taught
                        mesome things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He drummed impatiently on the table. He resented her impertinencefor, like
                        all men of clear and positive mind, he regarded contradiction as in one
                        aspect impudent, in another aspect evidence of the folly of his
                        contradictor. Then he gave a short laughthe confessing <pb id="VAA2369-032"
                            n="29"/> laugh of the clever man who has tried to believe his own
                        sophistries and has failed. &quot;Wellneither do I believe it,&quot;
                        said he.&quot; Now, to get the thing typewritten.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She seated herself at the machine and set to work. As his mind was full of
                        the agreement he could not concentrate on anything else. From time to time
                        he glanced at her. Then he gave up trying to work and sat furtively
                        observing her. What a quaint little mystery it was! There was in itthat is,
                        in hernot the least charm for him. But, in all his experience with women, he
                        could recall no woman with a comparable development of this curious quality
                        of multiple personalities, showing and vanishing in swift succession.</p>
                    <p>There had been a time when woman had interested him as a puzzle to be worked
                        out, a maze to be explored, a temple to be penetrateduntil one reached the
                        place where the priests manipulated the machinery for the wonders and
                        miracles to fool the devotees into awe. Some men never get to this stage,
                        never realize that their own passions, working upon the universal human love
                        of the mysterious, are wholly responsible for the cult of woman the sphynx
                        and the sibyl. But Norman, beloved of women, had been let by them into their
                        ultimate secretthe simple humanness of woman; the clap-trappery of the
                        oracles, miracles, and wonders. He had discovered that her &quot;divine
                        intuitions&quot; were mere shrewd guesses, where they had any meaning at
                        all; <pb id="VAA2369-033" n="30"/> that her eloquent silences were screens
                        for ignorance or boredomand so on through the list of legends that prop the
                        feminist cult.</p>
                    <p>But this girlthis Miss Hallowellhere was a tangible mysterya mystery of
                        physics, of chemistry. He sat watching herwatching the changes as she bent
                        to her work, or relaxed, or puzzled over the meaning of one of her own
                        hesitating stenographic hieroglyphicswatched her as the waning light of the
                        afternoon varied its intensity upon her skin. Why, her very hair partook of
                        this magical quality and altered its tint, its degree of vitality even, in
                        harmony with the other changes.... What was the explanation? By means of
                        what rare mechanism did her nerve force ebb and flow from moment to moment,
                        bringing about these fascinating surface changes in her body? Could
                        anything, even any skin, be better made than that superb skin of hersthat
                        master work of delicacy and strength, of smoothness and color? How had it
                        been possible for him to fail to notice it, when he was always looking for
                        signs of a good skin down townand up town, tooin these days of the ravages
                        of pastry and candy? ... What long graceful fingers she hadyet what small
                        hands! Certainly here was a peculiarity that persisted. Noabsurd though it
                        seemed, no! One way he looked at those hands, they were broad and strong,
                        another way narrow and gracefully weak.</p>
                    <p>He said to himself: &quot;The man who gets that girl <pb id="VAA2369-034"
                            n="31"/> will have Solomon&apos;s wives rolled into one. A harem at
                        the price of a wifeor a&quot; He left the thought unfinished. It seemed
                        an insult to this helpless little creature, the more rather than the less
                        cowardly for being unspoken; for, no doubt her ideas of propriety were
                        firmly conventional. &quot;About done?&quot; he asked impatiently.
                        She glanced up. &quot;In a moment. I&apos;m sorry to be so
                        slow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re not,&quot; he assured her truthfully.
                        &quot;It&apos;s my impatience. Let me see the pages you&apos;ve
                        finished.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With them he was able to concentrate his mind. When she laid the last page
                        beside his arm he was absorbed, did not look at her, did not think of her.
                        &quot;Take the machine away,&quot; said he abruptly.</p>
                    <p>He was leaving for the day when he remembered her again. He sent for her.
                        &quot;I forgot to thank you. It was good work. You will do well. All you
                        need is practiceand confidence. Especially confidence.&quot; He looked
                        at her. She seemed frailtouchingly frail. &quot;You are not
                        strong?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She smiled, and in an instant the frailty seemed to have been mere delicacy
                        of buildthe delicacy that goes with the strength of steel wires, or rather
                        of the spider&apos;s weaving thread which sustains weights and shocks
                        out of all proportion to its appearance. &quot;I&apos;ve never been
                        ill in my life,&quot; said she. &quot;Not a day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again, because she was standing before him in full <pb id="VAA2369-035"
                            n="32"/> view, he noted the peculiar construction of her framethe
                        beautiful lines of length so dextrously combined that her figure as a whole
                        was not tall. He said, &quot;A working womanor manneeds health above
                        all. Thank you again.&quot; And he nodded a somewhat curt dismissal.
                        When she glided away and he was alone behind the closed door, he reflected
                        for a moment upon the extraordinary amount of thinkingand the extraordinary
                        kind of thinkinginto which this poor little typewriter girl had beguiled
                        him. He soon found the explanation for this vagary into a realm so foreign
                        to a man of his high tastes and ambitions. &quot;It&apos;s because
                        I&apos;m so in love with Josephine,&quot; he decided.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve fallen into the sentimental state of all lovers. The
                        whole sex becomes novel and interesting and worth while.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As he left the office, unusually late, he saw her still at workno doubt doing
                        over again some bungled piece of copying. She had her normal and natural
                        look and airthe atomic little typewriter, unattractive and uninteresting.
                        With another smile for his romantic imaginings, he forgot her. But when he
                        reached the street he remembered her again. The threatened blizzard had
                        changed into a heavy rain. The swift and sudden currents of air, that have
                        made of New York a cave of the winds since the coming of the skyscrapers,
                        were darting round corners, turning umbrellas inside out, tossing
                        women&apos;s skirts about their heads, reducing all who were abroad to
                        the same level of drenched and sullen wretchedness. <pb id="VAA2369-036"
                            n="33"/> Norman&apos;s limousine was waiting at the curb. He,
                        pausing in the doorway, glanced up and down the street, had an impulse to
                        return and take the girl home. Then he smiled satirically at himself. Her
                        lot condemned her to be out in all weathers. It would not be a kindness but
                        an exhibition of smug vanity to shelter her this one night; also, there was
                        the question of her reputationand the possibility of turning her head,
                        perhaps just enough to cause her ruin. He sprang across the wind-swept,
                        rain-swept sidewalk and into the limousine whose door was being held open by
                        an obsequious attendant. &quot;Home,&quot; he said, and the door
                        slammed.</p>
                    <p>Usually these journeys between office and home or club in the evening gave
                        Norman a chance for ten or fifteen minutes of sleep. He had discovered that
                        this brief dropping of the thread of consciousness gave him a wonderful
                        fresh grip upon the day, enabled him to work or play until late into the
                        night without fatigue. But that evening his mind was wide awake. Nor could
                        he fix it upon business. It would interest itself only in the hurrying
                        throngs of foot passengers and the ideas they suggested: Here am Iso ran his
                        thoughtshere am I, tucked away comfortably while all those poor creatures
                        have to plod along in the storm. I could afford to be sick. They
                        can&apos;t. And what have I done to deserve this good fortune? Nothing.
                        Worse than nothing. If I had made my career along the lines of <pb

                        fellow men, I&apos;d probably be plugging home under an umbrellaand to a
                        pretty poor excuse for a home. But I was too wise to do that. I&apos;ve
                        spent this day, as I spend all my days, in helping the powerful rich to add
                        to their wealth and power, to add to the burdens those poor devils out there
                        in the rain must bear. And I&apos;m rewarded with a limousine, and all
                        the rest of it.</p>
                    <p>These thoughts neither came from nor produced a mood of penitence, or of
                        regret even. Norman was simply indulging in his favorite pastimefollowing
                        without prejudice the leading of a chain of pure logic. He despised
                        self-deceivers. He always kept himself free from prejudice and all Its
                        wiles. He took life as he found it; but he did not excuse it and himself
                        with the familiar hypocrisies that make the comfortable classes preen
                        themselves on being the guardians and saviours of the ignorant, incapable
                        masses. When old Lockyer said one day that this was the function of the
                        &quot;upper classes&quot; Norman retorted: &quot;Perhaps. But,
                        if so, how do they perform it? Like the brutal old-fashioned farm family
                        that takes care of its insane member by keeping him chained in filth in the
                        cellar.&quot; And once at the Federal Club By the way, Norman had joined
                        it, had compelled it to receive him just to show his associates how a strong
                        man could break even such a firmly established tradition as that no one who
                        amounted to anything could be elected to a fashionable club in New <pb
                            id="VAA2369-038" n="35"/> York. Once at the Federal Club old Galloway
                        quoted with approval some essayist&apos;s remark that every clever human
                        being was looking after and holding above the waves at least fifteen of his
                        weaker fellows. Norman smiled satirically round at the complacently nodding
                        circle of gray heads and white heads. &quot;My observation has
                        been,&quot; said he, &quot;that every clever chap is shrewd enough
                        to compel at least fifteen of his fellows to wait on him, to take care of
                        himdo his choresand his dirty work.&quot; The nodding stopped. Scowls
                        appeared, except on the face of old Galloway. He grinned. He was one of the
                        few examples of a very rich man with a sense of humor. Norman always thought
                        it was this slight incident that led to his getting the extremely
                        profitableand shadyGalloway business.</p>
                    <p>No, Norman&apos;s mood, as he watched the miserable crowds afoot and
                        reflected upon them, was neither remorseful nor triumphant. He simply noted
                        an interesting facta commonplace factof the methods of that sardonic
                        practical joker, Life. Because the scheme of things was unjust and stupid,
                        because others, most others, were uncomfortable or worsewhy should he make
                        himself uncomfortable? It would be an absurdity to get out of his limousine
                        and trudge along in the wet and the wind. It would be equally absurd to sit
                        in his limousine and be unhappy about the misery of the world. &quot;I
                        didn&apos;t create it, and I can&apos;t recreate it. And if
                        I&apos;m helping to make it worse, I&apos;m also hastening <pb
                            id="VAA2369-039" n="36"/> the time when it&apos;ll be better. The
                        Great Ass must have brains and spirit kicked and cudgeled into it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At his house in Madison Avenue, just at the crest of Murray Hill, there was
                        an awning from front door to curb and a carpet beneath it. He passed, dry
                        and comfortable, up the steps. A footman in quiet rich livery was waiting to
                        receive him. From rising until bedtime, up town and down town, wherever he
                        went and whatever he was about, every possible menial detail of his life was
                        done for him. He had nothing to do but think about his own work and keep
                        himself in health. Rarely did he have even to open or to close a door. He
                        used a pen only in signing his name or marking a passage in a law book for
                        some secretary to make a typewritten copy.</p>
                    <p>Upon most human beings this sort of luxury, carried beyond the ordinary and
                        familiar uses of menial service, has a speedily enervating effect. Thinking
                        being the most onerous of all, they have it done, also. They sink into
                        silliness and moral and mental sloth. They pass the time at foolish
                        purposeless games indoors and out; or they wander aimlessly about the earth
                        chattering with similar mental decrepits, much like monkeys adrift in the
                        boughs of a tropical forest. But Norman had the tenacity and strength to
                        concentrate upon achievement all the powers emancipated by the use of
                        menials wherever menials could be used. He employed to advantage the time
                        saved in putting in shirt buttons <pb id="VAA2369-040" n="37"/> and lacing
                        shoes and carrying books to and from shelves. In this lay one of the
                        important secrets of his success. &quot;Never do for yourself what you
                        can get some one else to do for you as well. Save yourself for the things
                        only <hi rend="i">you</hi> can do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In his household there were three persons, and sixteen servants to wait upon
                        them. His sistershe and her husband, Clayton Fitzhugh, were the other two
                        personshis sister was always complaining that there were not enough
                        servants, and Frederick, the most indulgent of brothers, was always letting
                        her add to the number. It seemed to him that the more help there was, the
                        less smoothly the household ran. But that did not concern him; his mind was
                        saved for more important matters. There was no reason why it should concern
                        him; could he not compel the dollars to flood in faster than she could bail
                        them out?</p>
                    <p>This brother and sister had come to New York fifteen years before, when he
                        was twenty-two and she nineteen. They were from Albany, where their family
                        had possessed some wealth and much social position for many generations.
                        There was the usual &quot;queer streak&quot; in the Norman familyan
                        intermittent but fixed habit of some one of them making a &quot;low
                        marriage.&quot; One view of this aberration might have been that there
                        was in the Norman blood a tenacious instinct of sturdy and self-respecting
                        independence that caused a Norman occasionally to do as he pleased instead
                        of as he conventionally <pb id="VAA2369-041" n="38"/> ought. Each time the
                        thing occurred there was a mighty and horrified hubbub throughout the
                        connection. But in the broad, as the custom is, the Normans were complacent
                        about the &quot;queer streak.&quot; They thought it kept the family
                        from rotting out and running to seed. &quot;Nothing like an occasional
                        infusion of common blood,&quot; Aunt Ursula Van Bruyten (born Norman)
                        used to say. For her Norman&apos;s sister was named.</p>
                    <p>Norman&apos;s father had developed the &quot;queer streak.&quot;
                        Their mother was the daughter of a small farmer and, when she met their
                        father, was chambermaid in a Troy hotel, Troy then being a largish village.
                        As soon as she found herself married and in a position with whose duties she
                        was unfamiliar, she set about fitting herself for them with the same
                        diligence and thoroughness which she had shown in learning chamber work in a
                        village hotel. She educated herself, selected not without shrewdness and
                        carefully put on an assortment of genteel airs, finally contrived to make a
                        most creditable appearancewas more aristocratic in tastes and in talk than
                        the high mightiest of her relatives by marriage. But her son Fred was a
                        Pinkey in character. In boyhood he was noted for his rough and low
                        associates. His bosom friends were the son of a Jewish junk dealer, the son
                        of a colored washwoman, and the son of an Irish day laborer. Also, the
                        commonness persisted as he grew up. Instead of seeking aristocratic ease, he
                        aspired to a career. He had <pb id="VAA2369-042" n="39"/> choice of several
                        rich and well-born girls; but he developed a strong distaste for marriage of
                        any sort and especially for a rich marriage. A fortune he was resolved to
                        have, but it should be one that belonged to him. When he was about ready to
                        enter a law office, his father and mother died leaving less than ten
                        thousand dollars in all for his sister and himself. His sister hesitated,
                        half inclined to marry a stupid second cousin who had thirty thousand a
                        year.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t do it, Ursula,&quot; Fred advised. &quot;If
                        you must sell out, sell for something worth while.&quot; He laughed in
                        his frank, ironical way. &quot;Fact is, we&apos;ve both made up our
                        minds to sell. Let&apos;s go to the best marketNew York. If you
                        don&apos;t like it, you can come back and marry that fat-wit any time
                        you please.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ursula inspected herself in the glass, saw a face and form exceeding fair to
                        look upon; she decided to take her brother&apos;s advice. At twenty she
                        threw over a multimillionaire and married Clayton Fitzhugh for loveClayton
                        with only seventeen thousand a year. Of course, from the standpoint of
                        fashionable ambition, seventeen thousand a year in New York is but one
                        remove from tenement house poverty. As Clayton had no more ability at making
                        money than had Ursula herself, there was nothing to do but live with Norman
                        and &quot;take care of him.&quot; But for this self-sacrifice of
                        sisterly affection Norman would have been rich at thirty-seven. As he had to
                        make her rich as well as himself, <pb id="VAA2369-043" n="40"/> progress
                        toward luxurious independence was slowerand there was the house, costing
                        nearly fifty thousand a year to keep up.</p>
                    <p>There had been a time in Norman&apos;s careera brief and very early
                        timewhen, with the maternal peasant blood hot in his veins, he had
                        entertained the quixotic idea of going into politics on the poor or
                        people&apos;s-side and fighting for glory only. The pressure of
                        expensive living had soon driven this notion clean off. Norman had almost
                        forgotten that he ever had it, was no longer aware how strong it had been in
                        the last year at law school. Young men of high intelligence and ardent
                        temperament always pass through this period. With somea fewits glory lingers
                        long after the fire has flickered out before the cool, steady breath of
                        world-liness.</p>
                    <p>All this time Norman has been dressing for dinner. He now leaves the third
                        floor and descends toward the library, as it still lacks twenty minutes of
                        the dinner hour.</p>
                    <p>As he walked along the hall of the second floor a woman&apos;s voice
                        called to him, &quot;That you, Fred?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He turned in at his sister&apos;s sitting room. She was standing at a
                        table smoking a cigarette. Her tall, slim figure looked even taller and
                        slimmer in the tight-fitting black satin evening dress. Her features faintly
                        suggested her relationship to Norman. She was a handsome woman, with a
                        voluptuous discontented mouth.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-044" n="41"/>
                    <p>&quot;What are you worried about, sis?&quot; inquired he.</p>
                    <p>How did you know I was worried?&quot; returned she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You always are.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you&apos;re unusually worried to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How did you know that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You never smoke just before dinner unless your nerves are
                        ragged.... What is it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course. No one in New York worries about anything
                        else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But <hi rend="i">this</hi> is serious,&quot; protested she.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve been thinkingabout your marriageand what&apos;ll
                        become of Clayton and me?&quot; She halted, red with embarrassment.</p>
                    <p>Norman lit a cigarette himself. &quot;I ought to have
                        explained,&quot; said he. &quot;But I assumed you&apos;d
                        understand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fred, you know Clayton can&apos;t make anything. And when you
                        marrywhywhat will become of us!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve been taking care of Clayton&apos;s moneyand of
                        yours. I&apos;ll continue to do it. I think you&apos;ll find
                        you&apos;re not so badly off. You see, my position enables me to compel
                        a lot of the financiers to let me in on the ground floorand to warn me in
                        good time before the house falls. You&apos;ll not miss me,
                        Ursula.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She showed her gratitude in her eyes, in a slight quiver of the lips, in an
                        unsteadiness of tone as she said, &quot;You&apos;re the real thing,
                        Freddie.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-045" n="42"/>
                    <p>&quot;You can go right on as you are now. Only&quot; He was looking
                        at her with meaning directness.</p>
                    <p>She moved uneasily, refused to meet his gaze. &quot;Well?&quot; she
                        said, with a suggestion of defiance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s all very natural to get tired of Clayton,&quot;
                        said her brother. &quot;I knew you would when you married him. But Sis,
                        I mind my own business. Still Why make a fool of yourself?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t understand,&quot; she exclaimed
                        passionately. And the light in her eyes, the color in her cheeks, restored
                        to her for the moment the beauty of her youth that was almost gone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Understand what?&quot; inquired he in a tone of gentle mockery.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Love. You are all ambitionall self-control. You can be
                        affectionateGod knows, you have been to me, Fred. But love you know nothing
                        aboutnothing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His was the smile a man gives when in earnest and wishing to be thought

                        charming, she appreciates, she flatters you. I&apos;m sure she loves you
                        as much as a <hi rend="i">girl</hi> knows how to love. But it&apos;s all
                        so conventional, so proper. Your positionher money. You two are of the
                        regulation type even in <pb id="VAA2369-046" n="43"/> that you&apos;re
                        suited to each other in height and figure. Everybody&apos;ll say,
                        &apos;What a fine coupleso well matched!&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe <hi rend="i">you</hi> don&apos;t understand,&quot;
                        said Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If Josephine were poor and low-bornweren&apos;t one of usand
                        all thatwould you have her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t know,&quot; was his prompt
                        and amused answer. &quot;I can only say that I know what I want, she
                        being what she is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ursula shook her head. &quot;I have only to see you and her together to
                        know that you at least don&apos;t understand love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It might be well if <hi rend="i">you</hi>
                        didn&apos;t,&quot; said Norman dryly. &quot;You might be less
                        unhappyand Clayton less uneasy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, but I can&apos;t help myself. Don&apos;t you see it in
                        me, Fred? I&apos;m not a fool. Yet see what a fool I act.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Spoiled childthat&apos;s all. No self-control.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You despise everyone who isn&apos;t as strong as you.&quot;
                        She looked at him intently. &quot;I wonder if you <hi rend="i">are</hi>
                        as self-controlled as you imagine. Sometimes I wish you&apos;d get a
                        lesson. Then you&apos;d be more sympathetic. But it isn&apos;t
                        likely you willnot through a woman. Oh, they&apos;re such pitifully easy
                        game for a man like you. But then men are the same way with youquite as
                        easy. You get anything you want.... You&apos;re really going to stick to
                        Josephine?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He nodded. &quot;It&apos;s time for me to settle down.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-047" n="44"/>
                    <p>&quot;YesI think it is,&quot; she went on thoughtfully. &quot;I
                        can hardly believe you&apos;re to marry. Of course, she&apos;s the
                        grand prize. StillI never imagined you&apos;d come in and surrender. I
                        guess you <hi rend="i">do</hi> care for her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why else should I marry?&quot; argued he.
                        &quot;She&apos;s got nothing I needexcept herself, Ursula.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What <hi rend="i">is</hi> it you see in her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What you seewhat everyone sees,&quot; replied Fred, with quiet,
                        convincing enthusiasm. &quot;What no one could help seeing. As you say,
                        she&apos;s the grand prize.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, she is sweet and handsomeand intelligent very superior,
                        without making others feel that they&apos;re outclassed.
                        Stillthere&apos;s something lackingnot in her perhaps, but in you. You
                        have it for hershe&apos;s crazy about you. But she hasn&apos;t it
                        for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t tell you. It isn&apos;t a thing that can be
                        put into words.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then it doesn&apos;t exist.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes it does,&quot; cried Ursula. &quot;If the
                        engagement were to be brokenor if anything were to happen to herwhy,
                        you&apos;d get over itwould go on as if nothing had happened. If she
                        didn&apos;t fit in with your plans and ambitions, she&apos;d be
                        sacrificed so quick she&apos;d not know what had taken off her head. But
                        if you felt what I meanthen you&apos;d give up everythingdo the wildest,
                        craziest things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What nonsense!&quot; scoffed Norman. &quot;I can imagine
                            <pb id="VAA2369-048" n="45"/> myself making a fool of myself about a
                        woman as easily as about anything else. But I can&apos;t imagine myself
                        playing the fool for anything whatsoever.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was mysterious fire in Ursula&apos;s absent eyes. &quot;You
                        remember me as a girlhow mercenary I was how near I came to marrying Cousin
                        Jake?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">I</hi> saved you from that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesand for what? I fell in love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And out again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was deceived in Claytondeceived myselfnaturally. How is a woman
                        to know, without experience?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;m not criticising, &quot;said the brother.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Besides, a love marriage that fails is different from a mercenary
                        marriage that fails.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Veryvery,&quot; agreed he. &quot;Just the difference
                        between an honorable and a dishonorable bankruptcy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anyhowit&apos;s bankruptmy marriage. But I&apos;ve learned
                        what love isthat there is such a thingand that it&apos;s valuable. Yes,
                        Fred, I&apos;ve got the taste for that winethe habit of it. Could I go
                        back to water or milk?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Spoiled babythat&apos;s the whole story. If you had a nursery
                        full of childrenor did the heavy houseworkyou&apos;d never think of
                        these foolish moonshiny things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yet you say you love!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Clayton is as good as any you&apos;re likely to run acrossis
                        better than <hi rend="i">some</hi> I&apos;ve seen about.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-049" n="[46]"/>
                    <p>&quot;How can <hi rend="i">you</hi> say?&quot; cried she.
                        &quot;It&apos;s for <hi rend="i">me</hi> to judge.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you would only <hi rend="i">judge!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ursula sighed. &quot;It&apos;s useless to talk to you. Let&apos;s
                        go down.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman, following her from the room, stopped her in the doorway to give her a
                        brotherly hug and kiss. &quot;You won&apos;t make an out-and-out
                        idiot of yourself, will you, Ursula?&quot; he said, in his winning
                        manner.</p>
                    <p>The expression of her eyes as she looked at him showed how strong was his
                        influence over her. &quot;You know I&apos;ll come to you for advice
                        before I do anything final,&quot; said she. &quot;Oh, I
                        don&apos;t know what I want! I only know what I don&apos;t want. I
                        wish I were well balancedas you are, Fred,&quot;</p>

                    <head>III</head>
                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> brother and sister dined alone. Clayton was finding
                        his club a more comfortable place than his home, in those days of his
                        wife&apos;s disillusionment and hesitation about the future. Many weak
                        creatures are curiously armed for the unequal conflict of existence some
                        with fleetness of foot, some with a pole-cat weapon of malignance, some with
                        porcupine quills, some with a &apos;possumlike instinct for
                        &quot;playing dead.&quot; Of these last was Fitzhugh. He knew when
                        to be silent, when to keep out of the way, when to &quot;sit
                        tight&quot; and wait. His wife had discovered that he was a foolthat he
                        perhaps owed more to his tailor than to any other single factor for the
                        success of his splendid pose of the thorough gentleman. Yet she did not
                        realize what an utter fool he was, so clever had he been in the use of the
                        art of discreet silence. Norman suspected him, but could not believe a human
                        being capable of such, fathomless vacuity as he found whenever he tried to
                        explore his brother-in-law&apos;s brain.</p>
                    <p>After dinner Norman took Ursula to the opera, to join the Seldins, and after
                        the first act went to Josephine, who had come with only a deaf old aunt. <pb
                            id="VAA2369-051" n="48"/> Josephine loved music, and to hear an opera
                        from a box one must be alone. Norman entered as the lights went up. It
                        always gave him a feeling of dilation, this spectacle of material
                        splendorthe women, whose part it is throughout civilization to-day to wear
                        for public admiration and envy the evidences of the prowess of the males to
                        whom they belong. A truer version of Dr. Holmes&apos;s aphorism would be
                        that it takes several generations in oil to make a deep-dyed snobwholly to
                        destroy a man&apos;s or a woman&apos;s point of view, sense of the
                        kinship of all flesh, and to make him or her over into the genuine believer
                        in caste and worshiper of it. For all his keenness of mind, of humor, Norman
                        had the fast-dyed snobbishness of his family and friends. He knew that caste
                        was silly, that such displays as this vulgar flaunting of jewels and costly
                        dresses were in atrocious bad taste. But it is one thing to know, another
                        thing to feel; and his feeling was delight in the spectacle, pride in his
                        own high rank in the aristocracy.</p>
                    <p>His eyes rested with radiant pleasure on the girl he was to marry. And she
                        was indeed a person to appeal to the passion of pride. Simply and most
                        expensively dressed in pearl satin, with only a little jewelry, she sat in
                        the front of her parterre box, a queen by right of her father&apos;s
                        wealth, her family&apos;s position, her own beauty. She was a large
                        womantall, a big frame but not ungainly. She had brilliant dark eyes, a
                        small proud head set upon shoulders that were <pb id="VAA2369-052" n="49"/>
                        slenderly young now and, even when they should became matronly, would still
                        be beautiful. She had good teeth, an exquisite smile, the gentle good humor
                        of those who, comfortable themselves, would not have the slightest objection
                        to all others being equally so. Because she laughed appreciatively and
                        repeated amusingly she had great reputation for wit. Because she
                        industriously picked up from men a plausible smatter of small talk about
                        politics, religion, art and the like, she was renowned as clever verging on
                        profound. And she believed herself both witty and wiseas do thousands, male
                        and female, with far less excuse.</p>
                    <p>She had selected Norman for the same reason that he had selected her; each
                        recognized the other as the &quot;grand prize.&quot; Pity is not
                        nearly so close kin to love as is the feeling that the other person
                        satisfies to the uttermost all one&apos;s pet vanities. It would have
                        been next door to impossible for two people so well matched not to find
                        themselves drawn to each other and filled with sympathy and the sense of
                        comradeship, so far as there can be comradeship where two are driving
                        luxuriously along the way of life, with not a serious cause for worry.
                        People without half the general fitness of these two for each other have
                        gone through to the end, regarding themselves and regarded as the most
                        devoted of lovers. Indeed, they were lovers. Only one of those savage tests,
                        to which in all probability they would never be exposed, would or could
                        reveal just how much, or <pb id="VAA2369-053" n="50"/> how little, that
                        vague, variable word lovers meant when applied to them.</p>
                    <p>As their eyes met, into each pair leaped the fine, exalted light of pride in
                        possession. &quot;This wonderful woman is mine!&quot; his eyes said.
                        And her eyes answered, &quot;And youyou most wonderful of menyou are
                        mine!&quot; It always gave each of them a thrill like intoxication to
                        meet, after a day&apos;s separation. All the joy of their dazzling good
                        fortune burst upon them afresh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll venture you haven&apos;t thought of me the whole
                        day,&quot; said she as he dropped to the chair behind her.</p>
                    <p>It was a remark she often madeto give him the opportunity to say,
                        &quot;I&apos;ve thought of little else, I&apos;m sorry to sayI,
                        who have a career to look after.&quot; He made the usual answer, and
                        they smiled happily at each other. &quot;And you?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I? What else has a woman to think about?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her statement was as true as his was false. He was indeed all she had to
                        think aboutall worth wasting the effort of thought upon. But hethough he did
                        not realize ithad thought of her only in the incidental way in which an
                        ambition-possessed man must force himself to think of a woman. The best of
                        his mind was commandeered to his career. An amiable but shakily founded
                        theory that it was &quot;our&quot; career enabled him to say without
                        sense of lying that his chief thought had been she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How those men down town would poke fun at <pb id="VAA2369-054"
                            n="51"/> you,&quot; said she, &quot;if they knew you had me with
                        you all the time, right beside you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This amused him. &quot;Still, I suspect there are lots of men
                        who&apos;d be exposed in the same way if there were a general and
                        complete show-down.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sometimes I wish I really were with youworking with youhelping you.
                        You have girlsa girlto be your secretaryor whatever you call
                        itdon&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You should have seen the one I had to-day. But there&apos;s
                        always something pathetic about every girl who has to make her own
                        living.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pathetic!&quot; protested Miss Burroughs. &quot;Not at all.
                        I think it&apos;s fine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You wouldn&apos;t say that if you had tried it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed, I should,&quot; she declared with spirit. &quot;You
                        men are entirely too soft about women. You don&apos;t realize how strong
                        they are. And, of course, women don&apos;t resist the temptation to use
                        their sex when they see how easy it is to fool men that way. The sad thing
                        about it is that the woman who gets along by using her sex and by appealing
                        to the soft-heartedness of men never learns to rely on herself.
                        She&apos;s likely to come to grief sooner or later.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s truth in all that,&quot; said Norman.
                        &quot;Enough to make it dangerously unjust. There&apos;s so much
                        lying done about getting on that it&apos;s no wonder those
                        who&apos;ve never tried to do for themselves get a wholly false notion
                            <pb id="VAA2369-055" n="52"/> of the situation. It is hardbitterly
                        hardfor a man to get on. Most men don&apos;t. Most men? All but a mere
                        handful. And if those who do get on were to tell the truththe <hi rend="i"
                            >whole</hi> truthabout how they succeededwell, it&apos;d not make a
                        pleasant story.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But <hi rend="i">you&apos;ve</hi> got on,&quot; retorted
                        the girl.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So I have. And how?&quot; Norman smiled with humorous cynicism.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll never tellnot allonly the parts that sound well. And
                        those parts are the least important. However, let&apos;s not talk about
                        that. What I set out to say was that, while it&apos;s hard for a man to
                        make a decent livingunless he has luckand harder stillmuch harderfor him to
                        rise to independence&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It wasn&apos;t so dreadfully hard for <hi rend="i"
                        >you</hi>,&quot; interrupted Josephine, looking at him with proud
                        admiration. &quot;But then, you had a wonderful brain.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That wasn&apos;t what did it,&quot; replied he.
                        &quot;And, in spite of all my advantagesfriendships, education, enough
                        money to tide me over the beginningsin spite of all that, I had a frightful
                        time. Not the work. Of course, I had to work, but I like that. No, it was
                        thethe maneuvering, let&apos;s call itthe hardening process.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everyone who succeedsin active life. You don&apos;t understand
                        the system, dear. It&apos;s a cutthroat game. It isn&apos;t at all
                        what the successful hypocrites describe in their talks to young
                        men!&quot; He laughed. &quot;If I <pb id="VAA2369-056" n="53"/> had
                        followed the &apos;guides to success,&apos; I&apos;d not be
                        here. Oh, yes, I&apos;ve made terrible sacrifices, but&quot; his
                        look at her made her thrill with exaltation&quot;it was worth doing....
                        I understand and sympathize with those who scorn to succeed. But
                        I&apos;m glad I happened not to be born with their temperament, at least
                        not with enough of it to keep me down.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re too hard on yourself, too generous to the
                        failures.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t mean the men who were too lazy to do the work
                        or too cowardly to dare thethe unpleasant things. And I&apos;m not hard
                        with myselfonly frank. But we were talking of the women. Poor things, what
                        chance have they got? You scorn them for using their sex. Wait till
                        you&apos;re drowning, dear, before you criticise another for what he
                        does to save himself when he&apos;s sinking for the last time. I used
                        everything I had in making my fight. If I could have got on better or
                        quicker by the aid of my sex, I&apos;d have used that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t say those things, Fred,&quot; cried Josephine,
                        smiling but half in earnest.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not? Aren&apos;t you glad I&apos;m here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She gave him a long look of passionate love and lowered her eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;At whatever cost?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said in a low voice. &quot;But I&apos;m
                            <hi rend="i">sure</hi> you exaggerate.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve done nothing <hi rend="i">you</hi> wouldn&apos;t
                        approve ofor <pb id="VAA2369-057" n="54"/> find excuses for. But
                        that&apos;s because youIall of us in this classand in most other
                        classeshave been trained to false ideasno, to perverted ideasto a system of
                        morality that&apos;s twisted to suit the demands of practical life. On
                        Sundays we go to a magnificent church to hear an expensive preacher and
                        choir, go in expensive dress and in carriages, and we never laugh at
                        ourselves. Yet we are going in the name of One who was born in a stable and
                        who said that we must give everything to the poor, and so on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I don&apos;t see what we could do about it&quot; she
                        said hesitatingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We couldn&apos;t do anything. Onlydon&apos;t you see my
                        point?the difference between theory and practice? Personally, I&apos;ve
                        no objectionno strong objectionto the practice. All I object to is the lying
                        and faking about it, to make it seem to fit the theory. But we were talking
                        of womenwomen who work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve no doubt you&apos;re right,&quot; admitted
                        she. &quot;I suppose they aren&apos;t to blame for using their sex.
                        I ought to be ashamed of myself, to sneer at them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;As a matter of fact, their sex does few of them any good. The
                        reverse. You see, an attractive womanone who&apos;s attractive <hi
                            rend="i">as</hi> a womancan skirmish round and find some one to support
                        her. But most of the working womenthose who keep on at itdon&apos;t find
                        the man. They&apos;re not attractive, not even at the start. After
                        they&apos;ve been at it a few years and lose the little <pb
                            id="VAA2369-058" n="55"/> bloom they ever hadwhy, they&apos;ve got
                        to take their chances at the game, precisely like a man. Only,
                        they&apos;re handicapped by always hoping that they&apos;ll be able
                        to quit and become married women. I&apos;d like to see how men would
                        behave if they could find or could imagine any alternative to &apos;root
                        hog or die.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter with you this evening, Fred? I never saw
                        you in such a bitter mood.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We never happened to get on this subject before.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes, we have. And you always have scoffed at the men who
                        fail.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I still scoff at themmost of them. A lot of lazy cowards. Or
                        else, so bent on self-indulgencepetty self-indulgencethat they refuse to
                        make the small sacrifice to-day for the sake of the large advantage day
                        after to-morrow. Or else so stuffed with vanity that they never see their
                        own mistakes. However, why blame them? They were born that way, and
                        can&apos;t change. A man who has the equipment of success and succeeds
                        has no more right to sneer at one less lucky than you would have to laugh at
                        a poor girl because she wasn&apos;t dressed as well as you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a mood! <hi rend="i">Something</hi> must have
                        happened.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said he reflectively. &quot;Possibly that
                        girl set me off.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What girl?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The one I told you about. The unfortunate little creature who was
                        typewriting for me this afternoon.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-059" n="56"/>
                    <p>Not so very little, either. A curious figure she had. She was tall yet she
                        wasn&apos;t. She seemed thin, and when you looked again, you saw that
                        she was really only slender, and beautifully shaped throughout.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Miss Burroughs laughed. &quot;She must have been attractive.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not in the least. Absolutely without charmand so homelyno, not
                        homelycommonplace. No, that&apos;s not right, either. She had a
                        startling way of fading and blazing out. One moment she seemed a blankpale,
                        lifeless, colorless, a nobody. The next minute she becameamazingly
                        different. Not the same thing every time, but different things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Frederick Norman was too experienced a dealer with women deliberately to make
                        the mistakerather, to commit the breach of tact and courtesyinvolved in
                        praising one woman to another. But in this case it never occurred to him
                        that he was talking to a woman of a woman. Josephine Burroughs was a lady;
                        the other was a piece of office machineryand a very trivial piece at that.
                        But he saw and instantly understood the look in her eyesthe strained effort
                        to keep the telltale upper lip from giving its prompt and irrepressible
                        signal of inward agitation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m very much interested,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, she was a curiosity,&quot; said he carelessly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Has she been therelong?&quot; inquired Josephine, with a
                        feigned indifference that did not deceive him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-060" n="57"/>
                    <p>&quot;Several months, I believe. I never noticed her until a few days
                        ago. And until to-day I had forgotten her. She&apos;s one of the kind
                        it&apos;s difficult to remember.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He fell to glancing round the house, pretending to be unconscious of the
                        furtive suspicion with which she was observing him. She said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s your secretary now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Merely a general office typewriter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The curtain went up for the second act. Josephine fixed her attention on the
                        stageapparently undivided attention. But Norman felt rather than saw that
                        she was still worrying about the &quot;curiosity.&quot; He marveled
                        at this outcropping of jealousy. It seemed ridiculousit <hi rend="i"
                        >was</hi> ridiculous. He laughed to himself. If she could see the girlthe
                        obscure, uninteresting cause of her agitationhow she would mock at herself!
                        Then, too, there was the absurdity of thinking him capable of such a stoop.
                        A woman of their own classor a woman of its corresponding class, on the
                        other side of the line yes. No doubt she had heard things that made her
                        uneasy, or, at least, ready to be uneasy. But this poorly dressed obscurity,
                        with not a charm that could attract even a man of her own lowly classIt was
                        such a good joke that he would have teased Josephine about it but for his
                        knowledge of the worlda knowledge in whose primer it was taught that teasing
                        is both bad taste and bad judgment. Also, it was beneath his dignity, <pb
                            id="VAA2369-061" n="58"/> it was offense to his vanity, to couple his
                        name with the name of one so beneath him that even the matter of sex did not
                        make the coupling less intolerable.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When the curtain fell several people came into the box, and he went
                        to make a few calls round the parterre. He returned after the second act.
                        They were again alonethe deaf old aunt did not count. At once Josephine
                        began upon the same subject. With studied indifferencehow amusing for a
                        woman of her inexperience to try to fool a man of his experience!she said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell me some more about that typewriter girl. Women who work always
                        interest me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She wouldn&apos;t,&quot; said Norman. The subject had been
                        driven clean out of his mind, and he didn&apos;t wish to return to it.
                        &quot;Some day they will venture to make judicious long cuts in
                        Wagner&apos;s operas, and then they&apos;ll be interesting. It
                        always amuses me, this reverence of little people for the great onesas if a
                        great man were always great. Nohe <hi rend="i">is</hi> always great. But
                        often it&apos;s in a dull way. And the dull parts ought to be
                        skipped.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t like the opera this evening,&quot; said she.
                        &quot;What you said a while ago has set me to thinking. Is that girl a
                        lady?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She works,&quot; laughed he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But she might have been a lady.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you know <hi rend="i">anything</hi> about
                        her?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-062" n="59"/>
                    <p>&quot;Except that she&apos;s trustworthyand insignificant and not too
                        good at her business.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shouldn&apos;t think you could afford to keep incompetent
                        people,&quot; said the girl shrewdly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps they won&apos;t keep her,&quot; parried Norman
                        gracefully. &quot;The head clerk looks after those things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He probably likes her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Norman, too indifferent to be cautious.
                        &quot;She has no &apos;gentlemen friends.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you know that?&quot; said the girl, and she could not
                        keep a certain sharpness out of her voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tetlow, the head clerk, told me. I asked him a few questions about
                        her. I had some confidential work to do and didn&apos;t want to trust
                        her without being sure.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He saw that she was now prey to her jealous suspicion. He was uncertain
                        whether to be amused or irritated. She had to pause long and with visible
                        effort collect herself before venturing:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, she does confidential work for you? I thought you said she was
                        incompetent.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He, the expert cross-examiner, had to admire her skill at that high science
                        and art. &quot;I felt sorry for her,&quot; he said. &quot;She
                        seemed such a forlorn little creature.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She laughed with a constrained attempt at raillery. &quot;I never should
                        have suspected you of such weakness. To give confidential things to a
                        forlorn little incompetent, out of pity.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-063" n="60"/>
                    <p>He was irritated, distinctly. The whole thing was preposterous. It reminded
                        him of feats of his own before a jury. By clever questioning, Josephine had
                        made about as trifling an incident as could be imagined take on really quite
                        imposing proportions. There was annoyance in his smile as he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shall I send her up to see you? You might find it amusing, and
                        maybe you could do something for her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Josephine debated. &quot;Yes,&quot; she finally said. &quot;I
                        wish you would send her&quot; with a little sarcasm&quot;if you can
                        spare her for an hour or so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t make it longer than that,&quot; laughed he.
                        &quot;Everything will stop while she&apos;s gone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It pleased him, in a way, this discovery that Josephine had such a common,
                        commonplace weakness as jealousy. But it also took away something from his
                        high esteem for heran esteem born of the lover&apos;s idealizings; for,
                        while he was not of the kind of men who are on their knees before women, he
                        did have a deep respect for Josephine, incarnation of all the material
                        things that dazzled hima respect with something of the reverential in it,
                        and something of awemore than he would have admitted to himself. To-day, as
                        of old, the image-makers are as sincere worshipers as visit the shrines. In
                        our prostrations and genuflections in the temple we do not discriminate
                        against the idols we ourselves have manufactured; on the contrary, them we
                        worship with peculiar gusto. Norman knew his gods were frauds, <pb
                            id="VAA2369-064" n="61"/> that their divine qualities were of the earth
                        earthy. But he served them, and what most appealed to him in Josephine was
                        that she incorporated about all their divine qualities.</p>
                    <p>He and his sister went home together. Her first remark in the auto was:
                        &quot;What were you and Josie quarreling about?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Quarreling?&quot; inquired he in honest surprise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I looked at her through my glasses and saw that the was all
                        upsetand you, too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is too ridiculous,&quot; cried he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She lookedjealous.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nonsense! What an imagination you have!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw what I saw,&quot; Ursula maintained. &quot;Well, I
                        suppose she has heard somethingsomething recent. I thought you had sworn
                        off, Fred. But I might have known.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman was angry. He wondered at his own exasperation, out of all proportion
                        to any apparent provoking cause. And it was most unusual for him to feel
                        temper, all but unprecedented for him to show it, no matter how strong the
                        temptation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a good idea, to make her jealous,&quot; pursued
                        his sister. &quot;Nothing like jealousy to stimulate interest.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Josephine is not that sort of woman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know better. All women are that sort. All men, too. Of course,
                        some men and women grow angry <pb id="VAA2369-065" n="62"/> and go away when
                        they get jealous while others stick closer. So one has to be
                        judicious.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Josephine and I understand each other far too well for such
                        pettiness.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Try her. No, you needn&apos;t. You have.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t I tell you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then what was she questioning you about?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just to show you how wrong you were, I&apos;ll tell you. She
                        was asking me about a poor little girl down at the officeone she wants to
                        help.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ursula laughed. &quot;To help out of your office, I guess. I thought
                        you&apos;d lived long enough, Fred, to learn that no woman trusts <hi
                            rend="i">any</hi> man about <hi rend="i">any</hi> woman. Who is this
                        &apos;poor little girl&apos;?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t even know her name. One of the
                        typewriters.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What made Josephine jealous of her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Haven&apos;t I told you Josephine was not&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I saw. Who is this girl?pretty?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman pretended to stifle a yawn. &quot;Josephine bored me half to death
                        talking about her. Now it&apos;s you. I never heard so much about so
                        little.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is there something up between you and the girl?&quot; teased
                        Ursula.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, that&apos;s an outrage!&quot; cried Norman.
                        &quot;She&apos;s got nothing but her reputation, poor child. Do
                        leave her that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is she very young?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-066" n="63"/>
                    <p>&quot;How should I know?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Youth is a charm in itself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What sort of rot is this!&quot; exclaimed he. &quot;Do you
                        think I&apos;d drop down to anything of that kindin <hi rend="i"
                        >any</hi> circumstances? A little working girland in my own
                        office?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why do you heat so, Fred?&quot; teased the sister.
                        &quot;Really, I don&apos;t wonder Josephine was torn up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>An auto almost ran into themone of those innumerable hairbreadth escapes that
                        make the streets of New York as exciting as a battleand as dangerous. For a
                        few minutes Ursula&apos;s mind was deflected. But a fatality seemed to
                        pursue the subject of the pale obscurity whose very name he was uncertain
                        whether he remembered aright.</p>
                    <p>Said Ursula, as they entered the house, &quot;A girl working in the
                        office with a man has-a magnificent chance at him. It&apos;s lucky for
                        the men that women don&apos;t know their business, but are amateurs and
                        too stuck on themselves to set and bait their traps properly. Is that girl
                        trying to get round you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What possesses everybody to-night!&quot; cried Norman.
                        &quot;I tell you the girl&apos;s as uninteresting a specimen as you
                        could find.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then why are <hi rend="i">you</hi> so interested in her?&quot;
                        teased the sister.</p>
                    <p>Norman shrugged his shoulders, laughed with his normal easy good humor and
                        went to his own floor.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-067" n="[64]"/>
                    <p>On top of the pile of letters beside his plate, next morning, lay a note from
                        Josephine: <text>

                                        dear. I&apos;ve an hour before lunch, and could see her
                                        then. I was out of humor last night. I&apos;m very
                                        penitent this morning. Please forgive me. Maybe I can do

                    <p>Norman read with amused eyes. &quot;Well!&quot; soliloquized he,
                        &quot;I&apos;m not likely to forget that poor little creature again.
                        What a fuss about nothing!&quot;</p>

                    <head>IV</head>
                    <p>M<hi rend="sc">ANY</hi> men, possibly a majority, have sufficient equipment
                        for at least a fair measure of success. Yet all but a few are downright
                        failures, passing their lives in helpless dependence, glad to sell
                        themselves for a small part of the value they create. For this there are two
                        main reasons. The first is, as Norman said, that only a few men have the
                        self-restraint to resist the temptings of a small pleasure to-day in order
                        to gain a larger to-morrow or next day. The second is that few men possess
                        the power of continuous concentration. Most of us cannot concentrate at all;
                        any slight distraction suffices to disrupt and destroy the whole train of
                        thought. A good many can concentrate for a few hours, for a week or so, for
                        two or three months. But there comes a small achievement and it satisfies,
                        or a small discouragement and it disheartens. Only to the rare few is given
                        the power to concentrate steadily, year in and year out, through good and
                        evil event or report.</p>
                    <p>As Norman stepped into his auto to go to the officehe had ridden a horse in
                        the park before breakfast <pb id="VAA2369-069" n="66"/> until its hide was
                        streaked with latherthe instant he entered his auto, he discharged his mind
                        of everything but the business before him down townor, rather, business
                        filled his mind so completely that everything else poured out and away. A
                        really fine minda perfect or approximately perfect instrument to the
                        purposes of its possessoris a marvelous spectacle of order. It is like a
                        vast public library constantly used by large numbers. There are alcoves,
                        rows on rows, shelves on shelves, with the exactest system everywhere
                        prevailing, with the attendants moving about in list-bottomed shoes,
                        fulfilling without the least hesitation or mistake the multitude of
                        directions from the central desk. It is like an admirably drilled army,
                        where there is the nice balance of freedom and discipline that gives
                        mobility without confusion; the divisions, down to files and even units, can
                        be disposed along the line of battle wherever needed, or can be marshaled in
                        reserve for use at the proper moment. Such a mind may be used for good
                        purpose or bador for mixed purposes, after the usual fashion in human
                        action. But whatever the service to which it is put, it acts with equal
                        energy and precision. Characterthat is a thing apart. The character
                        determines the morality of action; but only the intellect determines the
                        skill of action.</p>
                    <p>In the offices of that great law firm one of the keenest pleasures of the
                        more intelligent of the staff was watching the workings of Frederick
                        Norman&apos;s mind <pb id="VAA2369-070" n="67"/> its ease of movement,
                        its quickness and accuracy, its obedience to the code of mental habits he
                        had fixed for himself. In large part all this was born with the man; but it
                        had been brought to a state of perfection by the most painful labor, by the
                        severest discipline, by years of practice of the sacrifice of small
                        temptationstemptations to waste time and strength on the little pleasant
                        things which result in such heavy billsbills that bankrupt a man in middle
                        life and send him in old age into the deserts of poverty and contempt.</p>
                    <p>Such an unique and trivial request as that of Josephine Burroughs being
                        wholly out of his mental habit for down town, he forgot it along with
                        everything else having to do with uptown onlyalong with Josephine herself,
                        to tell a truth which may pique the woman reader and may be wholly
                        misunderstood by the sentimentalists. By merest accident he was reminded.</p>
                    <p>As the door of his private office opened to admit an important client he
                        happened to glance up. And between the edge of the door frame and his
                        client&apos;s automobile-fattened and carefully dressed body, he caught
                        a glimpse of the &quot;poor little forlornness&quot; who chanced to
                        be crossing the outer office. A glint of sunlight on her hair changed it
                        from lifelessness to golden vital vividness; the same chance sunbeam touched
                        her pale skin with a soft yellow radiationand her profile was delicately
                        fine and regular. Thus Norman, who observed <pb id="VAA2369-071" n="68"/>
                        everything, saw a head of finely wrought gold a startling cameo against the
                        dead white of office wall. It was only with the second thought that he
                        recognized her. The episode of the night before came backand
                        Josephine&apos;s penitent yet persistent note.</p>
                    <p>He glanced at the clock. Said the client in the amusing tone of one who would
                        like to take offense if he only dared, &quot;I&apos;ll not detain
                        you long, Mr. Norman. And really the matter is extremely
                        important.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There are not many lawyers, even of the first rank, with whom their big
                        clients reverse the attitude of servant and master. Norman might well have
                        been flattered. In that restrained tone from one used to servility and fond
                        of it and easily miffed by lack of it was the whole story of
                        Norman&apos;s long battle and splendid victory. But he was not in the
                        mood to be flattered; he was thinking of other things. And it presently
                        annoyed him that his usually docile mind refused to obey his will&apos;s
                        order to concentrate on the client and the businesssaid business being one
                        of those huge schemes through which a big monster of a corporation is
                        constructed by lawyers out of materials supplied by great capitalists and
                        controllers of capital, is set to eating in enormous meals the substance of
                        the people; at some obscure point in all the principal veins small but
                        leechlike parasite corporations are attached, industriously to suck away the
                        surplus blood so that the owners of the beast may say, &quot;It is
                        eating almost nothing. See how lean it is, <pb id="VAA2369-072" n="69"/>
                        poor thing! Why, the bones fairly poke through its meager hide.&quot;</p>
                    <p>An interesting and highly complicated enterprise is such a construction. It
                        was of the kind in which Norman&apos;s mind especially delighted;
                        Hercules is himself only in presence of an herculean labor. But on that day
                        he could not concentrate, and because of a trifle! He felt like a giant
                        disabled by a grain of dust in the eyeyes, a mere grain of dust! &quot;I
                        must love Josephine even more than I realize, to be fretted by such a paltry
                        thing,&quot; thought he. And after patiently enduring the client for
                        half an hour without being able to grasp the outlines of the project, he
                        rose abruptly and said: &quot;I must get into my mind the points
                        you&apos;ve given me before we can go further. So I&apos;ll not
                        waste your time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This sounded very like &quot;Clear outyou&apos;ve bored me to my
                        limit of endurance.&quot; But the motions of a mind such as he knew
                        Norman had were beyond and high above the client&apos;s mere cunning at
                        dollar-trapping. He felt that it was the part of wisdomalso soothing to
                        vanityto assume that Norman meant only what his words conveyed. When Norman
                        was alone he rang for an office boy and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please ask Miss Halliday to come here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The boy hesitated. &quot;Miss Hallowell?&quot; he suggested.</p>
                    <p>&quot;HallowellthanksHallowell,&quot; said Norman.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-073" n="70"/>
                    <p>And it somehow pleased him that he had not remembered her name. How
                        significant it was of her insignificance that so accurate a memory as his
                        should make the slip. When she, impassive, colorless, nebulous, stood before
                        him the feeling of pleasure was, queerly enough, mingled with a sense of
                        humiliation. What absurd vagaries his imagination had indulged in! For it
                        must have been sheer hallucination, his seeing those wonders in her. How he
                        would be laughed at if those pictures he had made of her could be seen by
                        any other eyes! &quot;They must be right when they say a man in love is
                        touched in the head. Only, why the devil should I have happened to get these
                        crazy notions about a person I&apos;ve no interest in?&quot;
                        However, the main pointand most satisfactorywas that Josephine would be at a
                        glance convincedconvictedmade ashamed of her absurd attack. A mere grain of
                        dust.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just a moment, please,&quot; he said to Miss Hallowell.
                        &quot;I want to give you a note of introduction.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He wrote the note to Josephine Burroughs: &quot;Here she is.
                        I&apos;ve told her you wish to talk with her about doing some work for
                        you.&quot; When he finished he looked up. She was standing at the
                        window, gazing out upon the tremendous panorama of skyscrapers that makes
                        New York the most astounding of the cities of men. He was about to speak.
                        The words fell back unuttered. For once more the hallucinationor whatever it
                        waslaid hold of him. That figure by the windowthat <pb id="VAA2369-074"
                            n="71"/> beautiful girl, with the great dreamy eyes and the soft and
                        languorous nuances of golden haze over her hair, over the skin of perfectly
                        rounded cheek and perfectly moulded chin curving with ideal grace into the
                        whitest and firmest of throats</p>
                    <p>&quot;Am I mad? or do I really see what I see?&quot; he muttered.</p>
                    <p>He turned away to clear his eyes for a second view, for an attempt to settle
                        it whether he saw or imagined. When he looked again, she was observing
                        himand once more she was the obscure, the cipherlike Miss Hallowell,
                        ten-dollar-a-week typewriter and not worth it. Evidently she noted his
                        confusion and was vaguely alarmed by it. He recovered himself as best he
                        could and debated whether it was wise to send her to Josephine. Surely those
                        transformations were not altogether his own hallucinations; and Josephine
                        might see, might humiliate him by suspecting more strongly ... Ridiculous!
                        He held out the letter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The lady to whom this is addressed wishes to see you. Will you go
                        there, right away, please? It may be that you&apos;ll get the chance to
                        make some extra money. You&apos;ve no objection, I suppose?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She took the letter hesitatingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will find her agreeable, I think,&quot; continued he.
                        &quot;At any rate, the trip can do no harm.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She hesitated a moment longer, as if weighing what he had said. &quot;No,
                        it will do no harm,&quot; she finally said. <pb id="VAA2369-075" n="72"
                        /> Then, with a delightful color and a quick transformation into a vision of
                        young shyness, &quot;Thank you, Mr. Norman. Thank you so much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not at allnot in the least,&quot; he stammered, the impulse
                        strong to take the note back and ask her to return to her desk.</p>
                    <p>When the door closed behind her he rose and paced about the room uneasily. He
                        was filled with disquiet, with hazy apprehension. His nerves were unsteady,
                        as if he were going through an exhausting strain. He sat and tried to force
                        himself to work. Impossible. &quot;What sort of damn fool attack is
                        this?&quot; he exclaimed, pacing about again. He searched his mind in
                        vain for any cause adequate to explain his unprecedented state. &quot;If
                        I did not know that I was wellabsolutely wellI&apos;d think I was about
                        to have an illnesssomething in the brain.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He appealed to that friend in any trying hour, his sense of humor. He laughed
                        at himself; but his nerves refused to return to the normal. He rushed from
                        his private office on various pretexts, each time lingered in the general
                        room, talking aimlessly with Tetlowand watching the door. When she at last
                        appeared, he guiltily withdrew, feeling that everyone was observing his
                        perturbation and was wondering at it and jesting about it. &quot;And
                        what the devil am I excited about?&quot; he demanded of himself. What
                        indeed? He seated himself, rang the bell.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-076" n="73"/>
                    <p>&quot;If Miss Hallowell has got back,&quot; he said to the office
                        boy, &quot;please ask her to come in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think she&apos;s gone out to lunch,&quot; said the boy.
                        &quot;I know she came in a while ago. She passed along as you was
                        talking to Mr. Tetlow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman felt himself flushing. &quot;Any time will do,&quot; he said,
                        bending over the papers spread out before himthe papers in the case of the
                        General Traction Company resisting the payment of its taxes. A noisome odor
                        seemed to be rising from the typewritten sheets. He made a wry face and
                        flung the papers aside with a gesture of disgust. &quot;They never do
                        anything honest,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;From the
                        stock-jobbing owners down to the nickel-filching conductors they
                        stealstealsteal!&quot; And then he wondered at, laughed at, his heat.
                        What did it matter? An ant pilfering from another ant and a sparrow stealing
                        the crumb found by another sparrowa man robbing another manall part of the
                        universal scheme. Only a narrow-minded ignoramus would get himself wrought
                        up over it; a philosopher would laughand take what he needed or happened to
                        fancy.</p>
                    <p>The door opened. Miss Hallowell entered, a small and demure hat upon her
                        masses of thick fair hair arranged by anything but unskillful fingers.
                        &quot;You wished to see me?&quot; came in the quiet little voice,
                        sweet and frank and shy.</p>
                    <p>He roused himself from pretended abstraction.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-077" n="74"/>
                    <p>&quot;Ohit&apos;s you?&quot; he said pleasantly. &quot;They
                        said you were out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was going to lunch. But if you&apos;ve anything for me to do,
                        I&apos;ll be glad to stay.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nono. I simply wished to say that if Miss Burroughs wished to make
                        an arrangement with you, we&apos;d help you about carrying out your part
                        of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was paleso pale that it brought out strongly the smooth dead-white purity
                        of her skin. Her small features wore an expression of pride, of haughtiness
                        even. And in the eyes that regarded him steadily there shone a cold lightthe
                        light of a proud and lonely soul that repels intrusion even as the Polar
                        fastnesses push back without effort assault upon their solitudes.
                        &quot;We made no arrangement,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are not more than eighteen, are you?&quot; inquired he
                        abruptly.</p>
                    <p>The irrelevant question startled her. She looked as if she thought she had
                        not heard aright. &quot;I am twenty,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have a mostmost unusual way of shifting to various ages and
                        personalities,&quot; explained he, with some embarrassment.</p>
                    <p>She simply looked at him and waited.</p>
                    <p>His embarrassment increased. It was a novel sensation to him, this feeling
                        ill at ease with a womanhe who was at ease with everyone and put others at
                        their ease or not as he pleased. &quot;I&apos;m sorry you and Miss
                            <pb id="VAA2369-078" n="75"/> Burroughs didn&apos;t arrange
                        something. I suppose she found the hours difficult.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She made me an offer,&quot; replied the girl. &quot;I
                        refused it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, as I told you, we can let you offanything within
                        reason.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you, but I do not care to do that kind of work. No doubt any
                        kind of work for wages classes one as a servant. But those people up
                        therethey make one <hi rend="i">feel</hi> itfeel menial.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not Miss Burroughs, I assure you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A satirical smile hovered round the girl&apos;s lips. Her face was
                        altogether lovely now, and no lily ever rose more gracefully from its stem
                        than did her small head from her slender form. &quot;She meant to be
                        kind, but she was insulting. Those people up there don&apos;t
                        understand. They&apos;re vain and narrow. Oh, I don&apos;t blame
                        them. Only, I don&apos;t care to be brought into contact with
                        them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her in wonder. She talked of Josephine as if she were
                        Josephine&apos;s superior, and her expression and accent were such that
                        they contrived to convey an impression that she had the right to do it. He
                        grew suddenly angry at her, at himself for listening to her. &quot;I am
                        sorry,&quot; he said stiffly, and took up a pen to indicate that he
                        wished her to go.</p>
                    <p>He rather expected that she would be alarmed. But if she was, she wholly
                        concealed it. She smiled slightly <pb id="VAA2369-079" n="76"/> and moved
                        toward the door. Looking after her, he relented. She seemed so youngwas so
                        youngand was evidently poor. He said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s all right to be proud, Miss Hallowell. But there is
                        such a thing as supersensitiveness. You are earning your living. If
                        you&apos;ll pardon me for thrusting advice upon you, I think
                        you&apos;ve made a mistake. I&apos;m sure Miss Burroughs meant well.
                        If you had been less sensitive you&apos;d soon have realized
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She patronized me,&quot; replied the girl, not angrily, but
                        with amusement. &quot;It was all I could do not to laugh in her face.
                        The idea of a woman who probably couldn&apos;t make five dollars a week
                        fancying she was the superior of any girl who makes her own living, no
                        matter how poor a living it is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman laughed. It had often appealed to his own sense of humor, the delusion
                        that the tower one happened to be standing upon was part of one&apos;s
                        own stature. But he said: &quot;You&apos;re a very foolish young
                        person. You&apos;ll not get far in the world if you keep to that road.
                        It winds through Poverty Swamps to the Poor House.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; replied she. &quot;One can always
                        die.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again he laughed. &quot;But why die? Why not be sensible and
                        live?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; replied she. She was looking away
                        dreamily, and her eyes were wonderful to see. &quot;There are many
                        things I feel and doand I don&apos;t at all understand why.
                        But&quot; An expression of startling resolution <pb id="VAA2369-080"
                            n="77"/> flashed across her face. &quot;But I do them, just the
                        same.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A brief silence; then, as she again moved toward the door, he said,
                        &quot;You have been working for some time?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Four years.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You support yourself?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I work to help out father&apos;s income. He makes almost
                        enough, but not quite.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Almost enough! The phrase struck upon Norman&apos;s fancy as both amusing
                        and sad. Almost enough for what? For keeping body and soul together; for
                        keeping body barely decently clad. Yet she was content. He said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You like to work?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not yet. But I think I shall when I learn this business. One feels
                        secure when one has a trade.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It doesn&apos;t impress me as an interesting life for a girl of
                        your age,&quot; he suggested.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;m not unhappy. And at home, of evenings and Sundays,
                        I&apos;m happy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Doing what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Reading and talking with fatherand doing the houseworkand all the
                        rest of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>What a monotonous narrow little life! He wanted to pity her, but somehow he
                        could not. There was no suggestion in her manner that she was an object of
                        pity. &quot;What did Miss Burroughs say to youif I may ask?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-081" n="78"/>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly. You sent me, and I&apos;m much obliged to you. I
                        realize it was an opportunityfor another sort of girl. I half tried to
                        accept because I knew refusing was only myqueerness.&quot; She smiled
                        charmingly. &quot;You are not offended because I couldn&apos;t make
                        myself take it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not in the least.&quot; And all at once he felt that it was
                        true. This girl would have been out of place in service. &quot;What was
                        the offer?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Suddenly before him there appeared a clever, willful child, full of the
                        childish passion for imitation and mockery. And she proceeded to
                        &quot;take off&quot; the grand Miss Burroughsenough like Josephine
                        to give the satire point and barb. He could see Josephine resolved to be
                        affable and equal, to make this doubtless bedazzled stray from the
                        &quot;lower classes&quot; feel comfortable in those palatial
                        surroundings. She imitated Josephine&apos;s walk, her way of looking,
                        her voice for the menialsgracious and condescending. The exhibition was
                        clever, free from malice, redolent of humor. Norman laughed until the tears
                        rolled down his cheeks.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You ought to go on the stage,&quot; said he. &quot;How
                        JosephineMiss Burroughs would appreciate it! For she&apos;s got a keen
                        sense of humor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not for the real jokelike herself,&quot; replied Miss
                        Hallowell.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re prejudiced.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. I see her as she is. Probably everyone else <pb
                            id="VAA2369-082" n="79"/> those around hersee her money and her clothes
                        and all that. But I sawjust her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He nodded thoughtfully. Then he looked penetratingly at her. &quot;How
                        did you happen to learn to do that?&quot; he asked. &quot;To see
                        people as they are?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father taught me.&quot; Her eyes lighted up, her whole
                        expression changed. She became beautiful with the beauty of an intense and
                        adoring love. &quot;Father is a wonderful manone of the most wonderful
                        that ever lived. He&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was a knock at the door. She startled; he looked confused. Both
                        awakened to a sense of their forgotten surroundings, of who and what they
                        were. She went and Mr. Sanders entered. But even in his confusion Norman
                        marrveled at the vanishing of the fascinating personality who had been
                        captivating him into forgetting everything else, at the reappearance of the
                        blank, the pale and insignificant personality attached to a typewriting
                        machine at ten dollars a week. No, not insignificant, not blanknever again
                        that, for him. He saw now the full realityand also why he, everyone, was so
                        misled. She made him think of the surface of the sea when the sky is gray
                        and the air calm. It lies smooth and flat and expressionlessinert,
                        monotonous. But let sunbeam strike or breeze ever so faint start up, and
                        what a commotion of unending variety! He could never look at her again
                        without being reminded of those infinite latent possibilities, without
                        wondering what new <pb id="VAA2369-083" n="80"/> and perhaps more charming,
                        more surprising varieties of look and tone and manner could be evoked.</p>
                    <p>And while Sanders was talkingprosing on and on about things Norman either
                        already knew or did not wish to knowhe was thinking of her. &quot;If she
                        happens to meet a man with enough discernment to fall in love with
                        her,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;he certainly will never weary.
                        What a pity that such a girl shouldn&apos;t have had a chance, should be
                        wasted on some unappreciative chucklehead of her class! What a pity she
                        hasn&apos;t ambitionor the quality, whatever it isthat makes those who
                        have it get on, whether they wish or no.&quot;</p>
                    <p>During the rest of the day he revolved from time to time indistinct ideas of
                        somehow giving this girl a chance. He wished Josephine would and could help,
                        or perhaps his sister Ursula. It was not a matter that could be settled, or
                        even taken up, in haste. No man of his mentality and experience fails to
                        learn how perilous it is in the least to interfere in the destiny of anyone.
                        And his notion involved not slight interference with advice or suggestion or
                        momentarily extended helping hand, but radical change of the whole current
                        of destiny. Also, he appreciated how difficult it is for a man to do
                        anything for a young womananything that would not harm more than it would
                        help. Only one thing seemed clear to himthe &quot;clever child&quot;
                        ought to have a chance.</p>
                    <p>He went to see Josephine after dinner that night. <pb id="VAA2369-084" n="81"
                        /> His own house, while richly and showily furnished, as became his means
                        and station, seemedand indeed was merely an example of simple, old-fashioned
                        &quot;solid comfort&quot; in comparison with the Burroughs palace.
                        He had never liked, but, being a true New Yorker, had greatly admired the
                        splendor of that palace, its costly art junk, its rotten old tapestries, its
                        unlovely genuine antiques, its room after room of tasteless magnificence,
                        suggesting a museum, or rather the combination home and salesroom of an art
                        dealer. This evening he found himself curious, critical, disposed to license
                        a long-suppressed sense of humor. While he was waiting for Josephine to come
                        down to the small salon into which he had been shown, her older sister
                        drifted in, on the way to a late dinner and ball. She eyed him admiringly
                        from head to foot.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve <hi rend="i">such</hi> an air, Fred,&quot; said
                        she. &quot;You should hear the butler on the subject of you. He says
                        that of all the men who come to the house you are most the man of the world.
                        He says he could tell it by the way you walk in and take off your hat and
                        coat and throw them at him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman laughed and said, &quot;I didn&apos;t know. I must stop
                        that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t!&quot; cried Mrs. Bellowes.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll break his heart. He adores it. You know, servants
                        dearly love to be treated as servants. Anyone who thinks the world loves
                        equality knows very little about human nature. <pb id="VAA2369-085" n="82"/>
                        Most people love to look up, just as most women love to be ruled. No, you
                        must continue to be the master, the man of the world, Fred.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was busy with her gorgeous and trailing wraps and with her cigarette or
                        she would have seen his confusion. He was recalling his scene with the
                        typewriter girl. Not much of the man of the world, then and there,
                        certainly. What a grotesque performance for a man of his position, for a
                        serious man of any kind! And how came he to permit such a person to mimic
                        Josephine Burroughs, a lady, the woman to whom he was engaged? In these
                        proud and pretentious surroundings he felt contemptibly guiltyand dazed
                        wonder at his own inexplicable folly and weakness.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Bellowes departed before Josephine came down. So there was no relief for
                        his embarrassment. He saw that she too felt constrained. Instead of meeting
                        him half way in embrace and kiss, as she usually did, she threw him a kiss
                        and pretended to be busy lighting a cigarette and arranging the shades of
                        the table lamp. &quot;Well, I saw your &apos;poor little
                        creature,&apos;&quot; she began. She was splendidly direct in all
                        her dealings, after the manner of people who have never had to make their
                        own wayto cajole or conciliate or dread the consequences of frankness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I told you you&apos;d not find her interesting.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, she was a nice little girl,&quot; replied Josephine with
                        elaborate graciousnessand Norman, the &quot;take-off&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA2369-086" n="83"/> fresh in his mind, was acutely critical of her
                        manner, of her mannerisms. &quot;Of course,&quot; she went on,
                        &quot;one does not expect much of people of that class. But I thought
                        her unusually well-manneredand quite clean.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tetlow makes &apos;em clean up,&quot; said Norman, a gleam
                        of sarcasm in his careless glance and tone. And into his nostrils stole an
                        odor of freshness and health and youth, the pure, sweet odor that is the
                        base of all the natural perfumes. It startled him, his vivid memory of a
                        feature of her which he had not been until now aware that he had ever noted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I offered her some work,&quot; continued Josephine,
                        &quot;but I guess you keep her too busy down there for her to do
                        anything else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Probably,&quot; said Norman. &quot;Why do you sit on the
                        other side of the room?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t know,&quot; laughed Josephine. &quot;I
                        feel queer to-night. And it seems to me you&apos;re queer,
                        too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I? Perhaps rather tired, dearthat&apos;s all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you and Miss Hallowell work hard to-day?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, bother Miss Hallowell. Let&apos;s talk about
                        ourselves.&quot; And he drew her to the sofa at one end of the big
                        fireplace. &quot;I wish we hadn&apos;t set the wedding so far
                        off.&quot; And suddenly he found himself wondering whether that remark
                        had been prompted by eagernessa lover&apos;s eagernessor by impatience
                        to have the business over and settled.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-087" n="84"/>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t act a bit natural to-night, Fred. You touch me
                        as if I were a stranger.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I like that!&quot; mocked he. &quot;A stranger hold your
                        hand like this?andkiss youlike this?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She drew away, suddenly laid her hands on his shoulders, kissed him upon the
                        lips passionately, then looked into his eyes. &quot;Do you love me,
                            Fred?<hi rend="i">really</hi>?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why so earnest?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve had a great deal of experience?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;More or less.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you ever loved any woman as you love me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve never loved any woman but you. I never before wanted
                        to marry a woman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you may be doing it becausewell, you might be tired and want to
                        settle down.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you believe that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I don&apos;t. But I want to hear you say it isn&apos;t
                        so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wellit isn&apos;t so. Are you satisfied?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m frightfully jealous of you, Fred.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a waste of time!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve got something to confesssomething to confesssomething

                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t confess,&quot; cried he, laughing but showing
                        that he meant it. &quot;Justdon&apos;t be wicked again.
                        That&apos;s much better than confession.&quot;</p>

                        you ofoh, dearest, I&apos;m <hi rend="i">so</hi> ashamed!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He put his arms round her and drew her to his shoulder. And the scene of
                        mimicry in his office flashed into his mind, and the blood burned in his
                        cheeks. But he had no such access of insanity as to entertain the idea of
                        confession.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was that typewriter girl,&quot; continued Josephine. She
                        drew away again and once more searched his face. &quot;You told me she
                        was homely.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not exactly that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Insignificant then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Isn&apos;t she?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesin a way,&quot; said Josephine, the condescending note in
                        her voice againand in his mind Miss Hallowell&apos;s clever burlesque of
                        that note. &quot;But, in another way Men are different from women. Now
                        Ia woman of my sortcouldn&apos;t stoop to a man of her class. But men
                        seem not to feel that way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said he, irritated. &quot;They&apos;ve the
                        courage to take what they want wherever they find it. A man will take gold
                        out of the dirt, because gold is always gold. But a woman waits until she
                        can get it at a fashionable jeweler&apos;s, and makes sure it&apos;s
                        made up in a fashionable way. I don&apos;t like to hear <hi rend="i"
                        >you</hi> say those things.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-090" n="86"/>
                    <p>Her eyes flashed. &quot;Then you <hi rend="i">do</hi> like that Hallowell
                        girl!&quot; she criedand never before had her voice jarred upon him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That Hallowell girl has nothing to do with this,&quot; he
                        rejoined. &quot;I like to feel that you really love me that
                        you&apos;d have taken me wherever you happened to find meand that
                        you&apos;d stick to me no matter how far I might drop.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I would! I would!&quot; she cried, tears in her eyes.
                        &quot;Oh, I didn&apos;t mean that, Fred. You know I
                        didn&apos;tdon&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She tried to put her arms round his neck, but he took her hands and held
                        them. &quot;Would you like to think I was marrying you for what you
                        have?or for any other reason whatever but for what you are?&quot;</p>
                    <p>It being once more a question of her own sex, the obstinate line appeared
                        round her mouth. &quot;But, Fred, I&apos;d not be <hi rend="i"
                        >me</hi>, if I werea working girl,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You might be something even better if you were,&quot; retorted
                        he coldly. &quot;The only qualities I don&apos;t like about you are
                        the surface qualities that have been plated on in these surroundings. And if
                        I thought it was anything but just you that I was marrying, I&apos;d
                        lose no time about leaving you. I&apos;d not let myself degrade
                        myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fredthat toneand don&apos;tplease don&apos;t look at me
                        like that!&quot; she begged.</p>
                    <p>But his powerful glance searched on. He said, &quot;Is <pb
                            id="VAA2369-091" n="87"/> it possible that you and I are deceiving
                        ourselvesand that we&apos;ll marry and wake upand be bored and
                        dissatisfiedlike so many of our friends?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nono,&quot; she cried, wildly agitated. &quot;Fred, dear we
                        love each other. You know we do. I don&apos;t use words as well as you
                        doand my mind works in a queer way Perhaps I didn&apos;t mean what I
                        said. No matter. If my love were put to the testFred, I don&apos;t ask
                        anything more than that your love for me would stand the tests my love for
                        you would stand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He caught her in his arms and kissed her with more passion than he had ever
                        felt for her before. &quot;I believe you, Jo,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;I believe you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I love you sothat I could be jealous even of herof that little girl
                        in your office. Fred, I didn&apos;t confess all the truth. It
                        isn&apos;t true that I thought her a nobody. When she first came in
                        hereit was in this very roomI thought she was as near nothing as any girl
                        I&apos;d ever seen. Then she began to changeas you said. Andoh, dearest,
                        I can&apos;t help hating her! And when I tried to get her away from you,
                        and she wouldn&apos;t come&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Away from me!&quot; he cried, laughing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I felt as if it were like that,&quot; she pleaded.
                        &quot;And she wouldn&apos;t comeand treated me as if she were queen
                        and I servantonly politely, I must say, for Heaven knows I don&apos;t
                        want to injure her&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shall I have her discharged?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-092" n="88"/>
                    <p>&quot;Fred!&quot; exclaimed she indignantly. &quot;Do you think I
                        could do such a thing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;d easily get another job as good. Tetlow can find her
                        one. Does that satisfy you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she confessed.&quot; It makes me feel meaner than
                        ever.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, Jo, let&apos;s drop this foolish seriousness about nothing
                        at all. Let&apos;s drop it for good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing at allthat&apos;s exactly it. I can&apos;t
                        understand, Fred. What is there about her that makes her haunt me? That
                        makes me afraid she&apos;ll haunt you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman felt a sudden thrill. He tightened his hold upon her hands because his
                        impulse had been to release them. &quot;How absurd!&quot; he said,
                        rather noisily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t it, thought?&quot; echoed she. &quot;Think
                        of you and me almost quarreling about such a trivial person.&quot;Her
                        laugh died away. She shivered, cried, &quot;Fred, I&apos;m
                        superstitious about her. I&apos;mI&apos;m<hi rend="i"
                        >afraid</hi>!&quot; And she flung herself wildly into his arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She <hi rend="i">is</hi> somewhat uncanny,&quot; said he, with
                        a lightness he was far from feeling. &quot;But, dearit isn&apos;t
                        complimentary to me, is it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Forgive me, dearestI don&apos;t mean that. I couldn&apos;t
                        mean that. ButI <hi rend="i">love</hi> you so. Ever since I began to love
                        you I&apos;ve been looking round for something to be afraid of. And this
                        is the first chance you&apos;ve given me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve given you!&quot; mocked he.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-093" n="[89]"/>
                    <p>She laughed hysterically. &quot;I mean the first chance I&apos;ve
                        had. And I&apos;m doing the best I can with it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They were in good spirits now, and for the rest of the evening were as
                        loverlike as always, the nearer together for the bit of rough sea they had
                        weathered so nicely. Neither spoke of Miss Hallowell. Each had privately
                        resolved never to speak of her to the other again. Josephine was already
                        regretting the frankness that had led her to expose a not too attractive
                        part of herselfand to exaggerate in his eyes the importance of a really
                        insignificant chit of a typewriter. When he went to bed that night he was
                        resolved to have Tetlow find Miss Hallowell a job in another office.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She certainly <hi rend="i">is</hi> uncanny,&quot; he said to
                        himself. &quot;I wonder whyI wonder what the secret of her is.
                        She&apos;s the first woman I ever ran across who had a real secret. <hi
                            rend="i">Is</hi> it real? I wonder.&quot;</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">OWARD</hi> noon the following day Norman, suddenly in need of
                        a stenographer, sent out for Miss Purdy, one of the three experts at
                        eighteen dollars a week who did most of the important and very confidential
                        work for the heads of the firm. When his door opened again he saw not Miss
                        Purdy but Miss Hallowell.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Purdy is sick to-day,&quot; said she. &quot;Mr. Tetlow
                        wishes to know if I would do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman shifted uneasily in his chair. &quot;Just as
                        wellperfectlycertainly,&quot; he stammered. He was not looking at
                        herseemed wholly occupied with the business he was preparing to dispatch.</p>
                    <p>She seated herself in the usual place, at the opposite side of the broad
                        table. With pencil poised she fixed her gaze upon the unmarred page of her
                        open notebook. Instead of abating, his confusion increased. He could not
                        think of the subject about which he wished to dictate. First, he noted how
                        long her lashes wereand darker than her hair, as were her well-drawn
                        eyebrows also. Never had he seen so white a skin or one so smooth. She
                        happened to be wearing a blouse with a Dutch neck that day. What a superb
                        throat! What <pb id="VAA2369-095" n="91"/> a line of beauty its gently
                        swelling curve made. Then his glance fell upon her lips, rosy-red, slightly
                        pouted. And what masses of dead gold hairno, not gold, but of the white-gray
                        of wood ashes, and tinted with gold! No wonder it was difficult to tell just
                        what color her hair was. Hair like that was ready to be of any color. And
                        there were her arms, so symmetrical in her rather tight sleeves, and
                        emerging into view in the most delicate wrists. What a marvelous skin!</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you ever posed?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She startled and the color flamed in her cheeks. Her eyes shot a glance of
                        terror at him. &quot;II,&quot; she stammered. Then almost defiantly,
                        &quot;Yes, I didfor a while. But I didn&apos;t suppose anyone knew.
                        At the time we needed the money badly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman felt deep disgust with himself for bursting out with such a question,
                        and for having surprised her secret. &quot;There&apos;s nothing to
                        be ashamed of,&quot; he said gently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;m not ashamed,&quot; she returned. Her agitation
                        had subsided. &quot;The only reason I quit was because the work was
                        terribly hard and the pay small and uncertain. I was confused because they
                        discharged me at the last place I had, when they found out I had been a
                        model. It was a church paper office.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again she poised her pencil and lowered her eyes. But he did not take the
                        hint. &quot;Is there anything you would rather do than this sort of
                        work?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-096" n="92"/>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing I could afford,&quot; replied she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you had been kind to Miss Burroughs yesterday she would have
                        helped you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t afford to do that,&quot; said the girl in
                        her quiet, reticent way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To do what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To be nice to anyone for what I could get out of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman smiled somewhat cynically. Probably the girl fancied she was truthful;
                        but human beings rarely knew anything about their real selves.
                        &quot;What would you like to do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not answer his question until she had shrunk completely within
                        herself and was again thickly veiled with the expression which made everyone
                        think her insignificant. &quot;Nothing I could afford to do,&quot;
                        said she. It was plain that she did not wish to be questioned further along
                        that line.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The stage?&quot; he persisted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hadn&apos;t thought of it,&quot; was her answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What then?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think about things I can&apos;t have. I never
                        made any definite plans.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But isn&apos;t it a good idea always to look ahead? As long as
                        one has to be moving, one might as well move in a definite
                        direction.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was waiting with pencil poised.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There isn&apos;t much of a future at this business.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-097" n="93"/>
                    <p>She shrank slightly. He felt that she regarded his remark as preparation for
                        a kindly hint that she was not giving satisfaction.... Well, why not leave
                        it that way? Perhaps she would quit of her own accord would spare him the
                        troubleand embarrassmentof arranging with Tetlow for another place for her.
                        He began to dictategave her a few sentences mockingly different from his
                        usual terse and clear statementsinterrupted himself with:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You misunderstood me a while ago. I didn&apos;t mean you
                        weren&apos;t doing your work well. On the contrary, I think
                        you&apos;ll soon be expert. But I thought perhaps I might be able to
                        help you to something you&apos;d like better.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He listened to his own words in astonishment. What new freak of madness was
                        this? Instead of clearing himself of this uncanny girl, he was proposing
                        things to her that would mean closer relations. And what reason had he to
                        think she was fitted for anything but just what she was now doingdoing
                        indifferently well?</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, so quietly that it seemed coldly,
                        &quot;but I&apos;m satisfied as I am.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her manner seemed to say with polite and restrained plainness that she was
                        not in the least appreciative of his interest or of himself. But this could
                        not be. No girl in her position could fail to be grateful for his interest.
                        No woman, in all his life, had ever failed to respond to his slightest
                        advance. No, it simply could not be. She <pb id="VAA2369-098" n="94"/> was
                        merely shy, and had a peculiar way of showing it. He said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have no ambition?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s not for a woman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was making her replies as brief as civility permitted. He observed her
                        narrowly. She was not shy, not embarrassed. What kind of game was this? It
                        could not be in sincere nature for a person in her position thus to treat
                        overtures, friendly and courteous overtures, from one in his position. And
                        never before neverhad a woman been thus unresponsive. Instead of feeling
                        relief that she had disentangled him from the plight into which his
                        impulsive offer had flung him, he was piquedangeredand his curiosity was
                        inflamed as never before about any woman.</p>
                    <p>The relations of the sexes are for the most part governed by traditions of
                        sex allurements and sex tricks so ancient that they have ceased to be
                        conscious and have become instinctive. One of these venerable first
                        principles is that mystery is the arch provoker. Norman, an old and expert
                        student of the great gamethe only game for which the staidest and most
                        serious will abandon all else to follow its merry callNorman knew this trick
                        of mystery. The woman veils herself and makes believe to flyan excellent
                        trick, as good to-day as ever after five thousand years of service. And he
                        knew that in it lay the explanation for the sudden and high upflaming of his
                        interest in this girl. &quot;What an <pb id="VAA2369-099" n="95"/> ass
                        I&apos;m making of myself!&quot; reflected he. &quot;When I care
                        nothing about the girl, why should I care about the mystery of her? Of
                        course, it&apos;s some poor little affair, a puzzle not worth puzzling
                        out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>All true and clear enough. Yet seeing it did not abate his interest a
                        particle. She had veiled herself; she was pretendingperhaps honestlyto fly.
                        He rose and went to the window, stood with his back to her, resumed
                        dictating. But the sentences would not come. He whirled abruptly.
                        &quot;I&apos;m not ready to do the thing yet,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll send for you later.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Without a word or a glance she stood, took her book and went toward the door.
                        He gazed after her. He could not refrain from speaking again.
                        &quot;I&apos;m afraid you misunderstood my offer a while
                        ago,&quot; said he, neither curt nor friendly. &quot;I forgot how
                        such things from a man to a young woman might be misinterpreted.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never thought of that,&quot; replied she unembarrassed.
                        &quot;It was simply that I can&apos;t put myself under obligation to
                        anyone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As she stood there, her full beauty flashed upon himthe exquisite form, the
                        subtly graceful poise of her body, of her headthe loveliness of that
                        goldenhued white skinthe charm of her small rosy mouththe delicate,
                        sensitive, slightly tilted noseand her eyesabove all, her eyes!so clear, so
                        sweet. Her voice had seemed thin and faint to him; its fineness now seemed
                            <pb id="VAA2369-100" n="96"/> the rarest delicacythe exactly fitting
                        kind for so evasive and delicate a beauty as hers. He made a slight bow of
                        dismissal, turned abruptly away. Never in all his life, strewn with gallant
                        experiencesnever had a woman thus treated him, and never had a woman thus
                        affected him. &quot;I am madstark mad!&quot; he muttered.
                        &quot;A ten-dollar-a-week typewriter, whom nobody on earth but myself
                        would look at a second time!&quot; But something within him hurled back
                        this scornful fling. Though no one else on earth saw or appreciatedwhat of
                        it? She affected <hi rend="i">him</hi> thusand that was enough.
                            &quot;<hi rend="i">I</hi> want her!... I <hi rend="i">want</hi> her!
                        I have never wanted a woman before.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He rushed into the dressing room attached to his office, plunged his face
                        into ice-cold water. This somewhat eased the burning sensation that was
                        becoming intolerable. Many were the unaccountable incidents in his
                        acquaintance with this strange creature; the most preposterous was this
                        sudden seizure. He realized now that his feeling for her had been like the
                        quiet, steady, imperceptible filling of a reservoir that suddenly announces
                        itself by the thunder and roar of a mighty cascade over the dam.
                        &quot;This is madnesssheer madness! I am still master within myself. I
                        will make short work of this rebellion.&quot; And with an air of
                        calmness so convincing that he believed in it he addressed himself to the
                        task of sanity and wisdom lying plain before him. &quot;A man of my
                        position caught by a girl <pb id="VAA2369-101" n="97"/> like that! A man
                        such as I am, caught by <hi rend="i">any</hi> woman whatever!&quot; It
                        was grotesque. He opened his door to summon Tetlow.</p>
                    <p>The gate in the outside railing was directly opposite, and about thirty feet
                        away. Tetlow and Miss Hallowell were going outevidently to lunch together.
                        She was looking up at the chief clerk with laughing eyesthey seemed
                        coquettish to the infuriated Norman. And Tetlowthe serious and squab young
                        ass was gazing at her with the expression men of the stupid squab sort put
                        on when they wish to impress a woman. At this spectacle, at the vision of
                        that slim young loveliness, that perfect form and deliciously smooth soft
                        skin, white beyond belief beneath its faintly golden tintthe hot blood
                        steamed up into Norman&apos;s brain, blinded his sight, reddened it with
                        desire and jealousy. He drew back, closed his door with a bang.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is not I,&quot; he muttered. &quot;What has happened?
                        Am I insane?&quot;</p>
                    <p>When Tetlow returned from lunch the office boy on duty at the gate told him
                        that Mr. Norman wished to see him at once. Like all men trying to advance
                        along ways where their fellow men can help or hinder, the head clerk was
                        full of more or less clever little tricks thought out with a view to making
                        a good impression. One of them was to stamp upon all minds his virtue of
                        promptnessof what use to be prompt unless you forced every <pb
                            id="VAA2369-102" n="98"/> one to feel how prompt you were? He went in to
                        see Norman, with hat in hand and overcoat on his back and one glove off, the
                        other still on. Norman was standing at a window, smoking a cigarette. His
                        appearancedress quite as much as mannerwas the envy of his subordinateas,
                        indeed, it was of hundreds of the young men struggling to rise down town. It
                        was so exactly what the appearance of a man of vigor and power and high
                        position should be. Tetlow practiced it by the quarter hour before his glass
                        at homenot without progress in the direction of a not unimpressive manner of
                        his own.</p>
                    <p>As Tetlow stood at attention, Norman turned and advanced toward him.
                        &quot;Mr. Tetlow,&quot; he began, in his good-humored voice with the
                        never wholly submerged under-note of sharpness, &quot;is it your habit
                        to go out to lunch with the young ladies employed here? If so, I wish to
                        suggestsimply to suggestthat it may be bad for discipline.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow&apos;s jaw dropped a little. He looked at Norman, was astonished
                        to discover beneath a thin veneer of calm signs of greater agitation than he
                        had ever seen in him. &quot;To-day was the first time, sir,&quot; he
                        said. &quot;And I can&apos;t quite account for my doing it. Miss
                        Hallowell has been here several months. I never specially noticed her until
                        the last few dayswhen the question of discharging her came up. You may
                        remember it was settled by you.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-103" n="99"/>
                    <p>Norman flung his cigarette away and stalked to the window.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Norman,&quot; pursued Tetlow, &quot;you and I have been
                        together many years. I esteem it my greatest honor that I am ablethat you
                        permit meto class you as my friend. So I&apos;m going to give you a
                        confidenceone that really startles me. I called on Miss Hallowell last
                        night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman&apos;s back stiffened.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is even more charming in her own home. And&quot; Tetlow
                        blushed and trembled &quot;I am going to make her my wife if I
                        can.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman turned, a mocking satirical smile unpleasantly sparkling in his eyes
                        and curling his mouth. &quot;Old man,&quot; he said, &quot;I
                        think you&apos;ve gone crazy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow made a helpless gesture. &quot;I think so myself. I
                        didn&apos;t intend to marry for ten yearsand thenI had quite a different
                        match in mind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter with you, Billy?&quot; inquired
                        Norman, inspecting him with smiling, cruelly unfriendly eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m damned if I know, Norman,&quot; said the head
                        clerk, assuming that his friend was sympathetic and dropping into the
                        informality of the old days when they were clerks together in a small firm.
                        &quot;I&apos;d have proposed to her last night if I hadn&apos;t
                        been afraid I&apos;d lose her by being in such a hurry....
                        You&apos;re in love yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-104" n="100"/>
                    <p>Norman startled violently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re going to get married. Probably you can sympathize.
                        You know how it is to meet the woman you want and must have.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman turned away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve hador thought I hadrather advanced ideas on the
                        subject of women. I&apos;ve always had a horror of being married for a
                        living or for a home or as an experiment or a springboard. My
                        notion&apos;s been that I wouldn&apos;t trust a woman who
                        wasn&apos;t independent. And theoretically I still think that&apos;s
                        sound. But it doesn&apos;t work out in practice. A man has to have been
                        in love to be able to speak the last word on the sex question.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman dropped heavily into his desk chair and rumpled his hair into
                        disorder. He muttered somethingthe head clerk thought it was an oath.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d marry her,&quot; Tetlow went on, &quot;if I
                        knew she was simply using me in the coldest, most calculating way. My only
                        fear is that I shan&apos;t be able to get herthat she won&apos;t
                        marry me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman sneered. &quot;That&apos;s not likely,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, it isn&apos;t,&quot; admitted Tetlow. &quot;Theythe
                        Hallowellsare nice peopleof as good family as there is. But they&apos;re
                        poorvery poor. There&apos;s only her father and herself. The old man is
                        a scientistspends most of his time at things that won&apos;t pay a
                        centutterly impractical. A gentlemanan able man, if a <pb id="VAA2369-105"
                            n="101"/> little crackedat least he seemed so to me who don&apos;t
                        know much about scientific matters. But getting poorer steadily. So I think
                        she will accept me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A gloomy, angry frown, like a black shadow, passed across Norman&apos;s
                        face and disappeared. &quot;You&apos;d marry heron those
                        terms?&quot; he sneered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course I <hi rend="i">hope</hi> for better terms&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman sprang up, strode to the window and turned his back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I&apos;m prepared for the worst. The fact is, she treats me
                        as if she didn&apos;t care a rap for the honor of my showing her
                        attention.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A trick, Billy. An old trick.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe so. But I really believe she doesn&apos;t realize.
                        She&apos;s queerhas been queerly brought up. Yes, I think she
                        doesn&apos;t appreciate. Then, too, she&apos;s young and lightalmost
                        childish in some ways.... I don&apos;t blame you for being disgusted
                        with me, Fred. Butdamn it, what&apos;s a man to do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cure himself!&quot; exploded Norman, wheeling violently on his
                        friend. &quot;You must act like a man. Billy, such a marriage is ruin
                        for you. How can we take you into partnership next year? When you marry, you
                        must marry in the class you&apos;re moving toward, not in any of those
                        you&apos;re leaving behind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you suppose I haven&apos;t thought of all that?&quot;
                        rejoined Tetlow bitterly. &quot;But I can&apos;t help myself.
                        It&apos;s useless for me to say I&apos;ll try. I shan&apos;t
                        try.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-106" n="102"/>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you want to get over this?&quot; demanded Norman
                        fiercely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course NoI don&apos;t. Fred, you&apos;d think better of
                        me if you knew her. You&apos;ve never especially noticed her.
                        She&apos;s beautiful.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman dropped to his chair again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Reallybeautiful,&quot; protested Tetlow, assuming that the
                        gesture was one of disgusted denial. &quot;Take a good look at her,
                        Norman, before you condemn her. I never was so astonished as when I
                        discovered how good-looking she is. I don&apos;t quite know how it is,
                        but I suppose nobody ever happened to see howhow lovely she is until I just
                        chanced to see it.&quot; At a rudely abrupt gesture from Norman he
                        hurried on, eagerly apologetic, &quot;And if you talk with her
                        She&apos;s very reserved. But she&apos;s the lady through and
                        through and has a good mind.... At least, I think she has. I&apos;ll
                        admit a man in love is a poor judge of a woman&apos;s mind. But, anyhow,
                        I <hi rend="i">know</hi> she&apos;s lovely to look at. You&apos;ll
                        see it yourself, now that I&apos;ve called your attention to it. You
                        can&apos;t fail to see it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman threw himself back in his chair and clasped his hands behind his head.
                            &quot;<hi rend="i">Why</hi> do you want to marry her?&quot; he
                        inquired, in a tone his sensitive ear approved as judicial.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How can I tell?&quot; replied the head clerk irritably.
                        &quot;Does a man ever know?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Alwayswhen he&apos;s sensibly in love.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-107" n="103"/>
                    <p>&quot;But when he&apos;s just in love? That&apos;s what ails
                        me,&quot; retorted Tetlow, with a sheepish look and laugh.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Billy, you&apos;ve got to get over this. I can&apos;t let
                        you make a fool of yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow&apos;s fat, smooth, pasty face of the overfed, underexercised
                        professional man became a curious exhibit of alarm and obstinacy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve got to promise me you&apos;ll keep away from
                        herexcept at the officeforsay, a week. Thenwe&apos;ll see.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow debated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s highly improbable that anyone else will discover
                        these irresistible charms. There&apos;s no one else hanging
                        round?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No one, as I told you the other day, when you questioned me about
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman shifted, looked embarrassed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope I didn&apos;t give you the impression I was ashamed of
                        loving her or would ever be ashamed of her anywhere?&quot; continued
                        Tetlow, a very loverlike light in his usually unromantic eyes. &quot;If
                        I did, it wasn&apos;t what I meantfar from it. You&apos;ll see, when
                        I marry her, Norman. You&apos;ll be congratulating me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman sprang up again. &quot;This is plain lunacy, Tetlow. I am amazed
                        at youamazed!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Get acquainted with her, Mr. Norman,&quot; pleaded the
                        subordinate. &quot;Do it, to oblige me. Don&apos;t condemn
                        us&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-108" n="104"/>
                    <p>&quot;I wish to hear nothing more!&quot; cried Norman violently.
                        &quot;Another thing. You must find her a place in some other officeat
                        once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re right, sir,&quot; assented Tetlow. &quot;I
                        can readily do that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman scowled at him, made an imperious gesture of dismissal. Tetlow,
                        chopfallen but obdurate, got himself speedily out of sight.</p>
                    <p>Norman, with hands deep in his pockets, stared out among the skyscrapers and
                        gave way to a fit of remorse. It was foreign to his nature to do petty
                        underhanded tricks. Grand strategyyes. At that he was an adept, and not the
                        shiftiest, craftiest schemes he had ever devised had given him a
                        moment&apos;s uneasiness. But to be driving a ten-dollar-a-week
                        typewriter out of her job to be maneuvering to deprive her of a for her
                        brilliant marriageto be lying to an old and loyal retainer who had helped
                        Norman full as much and as often as Norman had helped himthese sneaking bits
                        of skullduggery made him feel that he had sunk indeed. But he ground his
                        teeth together and his eyes gleamed wickedly. &quot;He shan&apos;t
                        have her, damn him!&quot; he muttered. &quot;She&apos;s not for
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He summoned Tetlow, who was obviously low in mind as the result of revolving
                        the things that had been said to him. &quot;Billy,&quot; he began in
                        a tone so amiable that he was ashamed for himself, &quot;you&apos;ll
                        not forget I have your promise?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-109" n="105"/>
                    <p>&quot;What did I promise?&quot; cried Tetlow, his voice shrill with
                        alarm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not to see her, except at the office, for a week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I&apos;ve promised her father I&apos;d call this
                        evening. He&apos;s going to show me some experiments.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can easily make an excusebusiness.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I don&apos;t want to,&quot; protested the head clerk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the use? I&apos;ve got my mind made up. Norman,
                        I&apos;d hang on after her if you fired me out of this office for it.
                        And I can&apos;t restI&apos;m fit for nothinguntil this
                        matter&apos;s settled. I came very near taking her aside and proposing
                        to her, just after I went out of here a while ago.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You <hi rend="i">damn</hi> fool!&quot; cried Norman, losing all
                        control of himself. &quot;Take the afternoon express for Albany instead
                        of Harcott and attend to those registrations and arrange for those hearings.
                        I&apos;ll do my best to save you. I&apos;ll bring the girl in here
                        and keep her at work until you get out of the way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow glanced at his friend; then the tears came into his eyes.
                        &quot;You&apos;re a hell of a friend!&quot; he ejaculated.
                        &quot;And I thought you&apos;d sympathize because you were in
                        love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do sympathize, Billy,&quot; Norman replied with an abrupt
                        change to shamefaced apology. &quot;I sympathize more than you know. I
                        feel like a dog, doing this. But it can&apos;t result in any harm, and I
                        want you to get a little fresh air in that hot brain of yours before you <pb
                            id="VAA2369-110" n="106"/> commit yourself. Be reasonable, old man.
                        Suppose you rushed ahead and proposedand she acceptedand then, after a few
                        days, you came to. What about her? You must act on the level, Tetlow. Do the
                        fair thing by yourself and by her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman had often had occasion to feel proud of the ingenuity and
                        resourcefulness of his brain. He had never been quite so proud as he was
                        when he finished that speech. It pacified Tetlow; it lightened his own sense
                        of guilt; it gave him a respite.</p>
                    <p>Tetlow rewarded Norman with the look that in New York is the equivalent of
                        the handclasp friend seeks from friend in times of stress.
                        &quot;You&apos;re right, Fred. I&apos;m much obliged to you. I
                        haven&apos;t been considering <hi rend="i">her</hi> side of it enough. A
                        man ought always to think of that. The womenpoor thingshave a hard enough
                        time to get on, at best.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman&apos;s smile was characteristically cynical. Sentimentality amused
                        him. &quot;I doubt if there are more female wrecks than male wrecks
                        scattered about the earth,&quot; rejoined he. &quot;And I suspect
                        the fact isn&apos;t due to the gentleness of man with woman, either.
                        Don&apos;t fret for the ladies, Tetlow. They know how to take care of
                        themselves. They know how to milk with a sure and a steady hand. You may
                        find it out by depressing experience some day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow saw the aim. His obstinate, wretched expression came back. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t care. I&apos;ve got&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-111" n="107"/>
                    <p>&quot;You went over that ground,&quot; interrupted Norman
                        impatiently. &quot;You&apos;d better be catching the
                        train.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As Tetlow withdrew, he rang for an office boy and sent him to summon Miss
                        Hallowell.</p>
                    <p>Norman had been reasoning with himselfwith the aid of the self that was both
                        better and more worldly wise. He felt that his wrestlings had not been
                        wholly futile. He believed he had got the strength to face the girl with a
                        respectful mind, with a mind resolute in dutyif not lovetoward Josephine
                        Burroughs. &quot;I <hi rend="i">love</hi> Josephine,&quot; he said
                        to himself. &quot;My feeling for this girl is some sort of physical
                        attraction. I certainly shall be able to control it enough to keep it within
                        myself. And soon it will die out. No doubt I&apos;ve felt much the same
                        thing as strongly before. But it didn&apos;t take hold because I was
                        never bound beforenever had the sense of the necessity for restraint. That
                        sense is always highly dangerous for my sort of man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This sounded well. He eyed the entering girl coldly, said in a voice that
                        struck him as excellent indifference, &quot;Bring your machine in here,
                        Miss Hallowell, and recopy these papers. I&apos;ve made some changes. If
                        you spoil any sheets, don&apos;t throw them away, but return everything
                        to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m always careful about the waste-paper
                        baskets,&quot; said she, &quot;since they warned me that there are
                        men who make a living searching the waste thrown out of offices.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-112" n="108"/>
                    <p>He made no reply. He could not have spoken if he had tried. Once more the
                        spell had seized himthe spell of her weird fascination for him. As she sat
                        typewriting, with her back almost toward him, he sat watching her and
                        analyzing his own folly. He knew that diagnosing a disease does not cure it;
                        but he found an acute pleasure in lingering upon all the details of the
                        effect she had upon his nerves. He did not dare move from his desk, from the
                        position that put a huge table and a revolving case of reference books
                        between them. He believed that if he went nearer he would be unable to
                        resist seizing her in his arms and pouring out the passion that was playing
                        along his nerves as the delicate, intense flame flits back and forth along
                        the surface of burning alcohol.</p>
                    <p>A knock at the door. He plunged into his papers. &quot;Come!&quot; he
                        called.</p>
                    <p>Tetlow thrust in his head. Miss Hallowell did not look up.
                        &quot;I&apos;m off,&quot; the head clerk said. His gaze was upon
                        the unconscious girla gaze that filled Norman with longing to strangle him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Telegraph me from Albany as soon as you get there,&quot; said
                        Norman. &quot;Telegraph me at my club.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow was gone. The machine tapped monotonously on. The barette which held
                        the girl&apos;s hair at the back was so high that the full beauty of the
                        nape of her neck was revealed. That wonderful white skin with the golden
                        tint! How softyet how firmher <pb id="VAA2369-113" n="109"/> flesh looked!
                        How slender yet how strong was her build</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you like Tetlow?&quot; he asked, because speak to her he
                        must.</p>
                    <p>She glanced up, turned in her chair. He quivered before the gaze from those
                        enchanting eyes of hers. &quot;I beg pardon,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;I didn&apos;t hear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tetlowhow do you like him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is very kind to meto everyone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How did your father like him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He confidently expected some sign of confusion, but there was no sign.
                        &quot;Father was delighted with him,&quot; she said merrily.
                        &quot;He took an interest in the work father&apos;s doingand that
                        was enough.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was about to turn back to her task. He hastened to ask another question.
                        &quot;Couldn&apos;t I meet your father some time? What Tetlow told
                        me interested me greatly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father would be awfully pleased,&quot; replied she.
                        &quot;Butunless you really care aboutbiology, I don&apos;t think
                        you&apos;d like coming.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m interested in everything interesting,&quot;
                        replied Norman dizzily. What was he saying? What was he doing? What folly
                        was his madness plunging him into?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can come with Mr. Tetlow when he gets back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d prefer to talk with him alone,&quot; said Norman.
                        &quot;Perhaps I might see some way to be of service to him.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-114" n="110"/>
                    <p>Her expression was vividly different from what it had been when he offered to
                        help <hi rend="i">her.</hi> She became radiant with happiness. &quot;I
                        do hope you&apos;ll come,&quot; she saidher voice very low and
                        sweet, in the effort she was making to restrain yet express her feelings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When? This evening?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s always at home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll be there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m always there, too. We have no friends. It&apos;s
                        not easy to make acquaintances in the Eastcongenial acquaintances.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d want you to be there,&quot; he explained with
                        great care, &quot;because you could help him and me in getting
                        acquainted.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he&apos;ll talk freelyto anyone. He talks only the one
                        subject. He never thinks of anything else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was resting her crossed arms on the back of her chair and, with her chin
                        upon them, was looking at hima childlike pose and a childlike expression. He
                        said: &quot;You are <hi rend="i">sure</hi> you are twenty?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She smiled gayly. &quot;Nearly twenty-one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Old enough to be in love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She lifted her head and laughed. She had charming white teethsmall and sharp
                        and with enough irregularity to carry out her general suggestion of
                        variability. &quot;Yes, I shall like that, when it comes,&quot; she
                        said. &quot;But the chances are against it just now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s Tetlow.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-115" n="111"/>
                    <p>She was much amused. &quot;Oh, he&apos;s far too old and
                        serious.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman felt depressed. &quot;Why, he&apos;s only
                        thirtyfive.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I&apos;m not twenty-one,&quot; she reminded him.
                        &quot;I&apos;d want some one of my own age. I&apos;m tired of
                        being so solemn. If I had love, I&apos;d expect it to change all
                        that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Evidently a forlorn and foolish personand doubtless thinking of him, two
                        years the senior of Tetlow and far more serious, as an elderly person, in
                        the same class with her father. &quot;But you like biology?&quot; he
                        said. The way to a cure was to make her talk on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know anything about it,&quot; said she,
                        looking as frivolous as a butterfly or a breeze-bobbed blossom. &quot;I
                        listen to father, but it&apos;s all beyond me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Yesa light-weight. They could have nothing in common. She was a mere surfacea
                        thrillingly beautiful surface, but not a full-fledged woman. So little did
                        conversation with him interest her, she had taken advantage of the short
                        pause to resume her work. No, she had not the faintest interest in him. It
                        wasn&apos;t a trick of coquetry; it was genuine. He whom women had
                        always bowed before was unable to arouse in her a spark of interest. She
                        cared neither for what he had nor for what he was, in himself. This offended
                        and wounded him. He struggled sulkily with his papers for half an hour. Then
                        he fell to watching her again and</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must not neglect to give me your address,&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA2369-116" n="112"/> he said. &quot;Write it on a slip of
                        paper after you finish. I might forget it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; she replied, but did not turn round.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, do you think, did Tetlow come to see you?&quot; he asked.
                        He felt cheapened in his own eyeshe, the great man, the arrived man, the
                        fianc of Josephine Burroughs, engaged in this halting and sneaking
                        flirtation! But he could not restrain himself.</p>
                    <p>She turned to answer. &quot;Mr. Tetlow works very hard and has few
                        friends. He had heard of my father and wanted to meet himjust like
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Naturally,&quot; murmured Norman, in confusion. &quot;I
                        thoughtperhapshe was interested in <hi rend="i">you.</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>She laughed outrightand he had an entrancing view of the clean rosy interior
                        of her mouth. &quot;In <hi rend="i">me</hi>?Mr. Tetlow? Why,
                        he&apos;s too serious and important for a girl like me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then he bored you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no. I like him. He is a good manthoroughly good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This pleased Norman immensely. It may be fine to be good, but to be called
                        goodthat is somehow a different matter. It removes a man at once from the
                        jealousy-provoking class. &quot;Good exactly describes him,&quot;
                        said Norman. &quot;He wouldn&apos;t harm a fly. In love
                        he&apos;d be ridiculous.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not with a woman of his own age and kind,&quot; protested she.
                        &quot;But I&apos;m neglecting my work.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-117" n="113"/>
                    <p>And she returned to it with a resolute manner that made him ashamed to
                        interrupt againespecially after the unconscious savage rebukes she had
                        administered. He sat there fighting against the impulse to watch her
                        denouncing himselfappealing to pride, to shame, to prudenceto his love for
                        Josephineto the sense of decency that restrains a hunter from aiming at a
                        harmless tame song bird. But all in vain. He concentrated upon her at last,
                        stared miserably at her, filled with longing and dread and shameand longing,
                        and yet more longing.</p>
                    <p>When she finished and stood at the other side of the desk, waiting for him to
                        pass upon her work, she must have thought he was in a profound abstraction.
                        He did not speak, made a slight motion with his hand to indicate that she
                        was to go. Shut in alone, he buried his face in his arms. &quot;What
                        madness!&quot; he groaned. &quot;If I loved her, there&apos;d be
                        some excuse for me. But I don&apos;t. I couldn&apos;t. Yet I seem
                        ready to ruin everything, merely to gratify a selfish whiman insane
                        whim.&quot;</p>
                    <p>On top of the papers she had left he saw a separate slip. He drew it toward
                        him, spread it out before him. Her address. An unknown street in Jersey
                        City!</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll not go,&quot; he said aloud, pushing the slip
                        away. Go? Certainly not. He had never really meant to go. He would, of
                        course, keep his engagement with Josephine. &quot;And I&apos;ll not
                        come down town until she has taken <pb id="VAA2369-118" n="[114]"/> another
                        job and has caught Tetlow. I&apos;ll stop this idiocy of trying to make
                        an impression on a person not worth impressing. What weak vanityto be piqued
                        by this girl&apos;s lack of interest!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Neverthelesshe at six o&apos;clock telephoned to the Burroughs&apos;
                        house that he was detained down town. He sent away his motor, dined alone in
                        the station restaurant in Jersey City. And at half past seven he set out in
                        a cab in search ofwhat? He did not dare answer that interrogation.</p>

                    <head>VI</head>
                    <p>L<hi rend="sc">IKE</hi> many another chance explorer from New York, Norman
                        was surprised to discover that, within a few minutes of leaving the railway
                        station, his cab was moving through a not unattractive city. He expected to
                        find the Hallowells in a tenement in some more or less squalid street
                        overhung with railway smoke and bedaubed with railway grime. He was
                        delighted when the driver assured him that there was no mistake, that the
                        comfortable little cottage across the width of the sidewalk and a small
                        front yard was the sought-for destination.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait, please,&quot; he said to the cabman. &quot;Or, if you
                        like, you can go to that corner saloon down there. I&apos;ll know where
                        to find you.&quot; And he gave him half a dollar.</p>
                    <p>The cabman hesitated between two theories of this conductwhether it was the
                        generosity it seemed or was a ruse to &quot;side step&quot; payment.
                        Heor his thirstdecided for the decency of human nature; he drove confidingly
                        away. Norman went up the tiny stoop and rang. The sound of a piano, in the
                        room on the ground floor where there was light, abruptly ceased. The door
                            <pb id="VAA2369-120" n="116"/> opened and Miss Hallowell stood before
                        him. She was throughout a different person from the girl of the office. She
                        had changed to a tight-fitting pale-blue linen dress made all in one piece.
                        Norman could now have not an instant&apos;s doubt about the genuineness,
                        the bewitching actuality, of her beauty. The wonder was how she could
                        contrive to conceal so much of it for the purposes of business. It was a
                        peculiar kind of beautynot the radiant kind, but that which shines with a
                        soft glow and gives him who sees it the delightful sense of being its
                        original and sole discoverer. An artistic eyeor an eye that discriminates in
                        and responds to feminine lovelinesswould have been captivated, as it
                        searched in vain for flaw.</p>
                    <p>If Norman anticipated that she would be nervous before the task of receiving
                        in her humbleness so distinguished a visitor, he must have been straightway
                        disappointed. Whether from a natural lack of that sense of social
                        differences which is developed to the most pitiful snobbishness in New York
                        or from her youth and inexperience, she received him as if he had been one
                        of the neighbors dropping in after supper. And it was Norman who was ill at
                        ease. Nothing is more disconcerting to a man accustomed to be received with
                        due respect to his importance than to find himself put upon the common human
                        level and compelled to &quot;make good&quot; all over again from the
                        beginning. He felthe knewthat he was an humble candidate for her <pb
                            id="VAA2369-121" n="117"/> favora candidate with the chances perhaps
                        against him.</p>
                    <p>The tiny parlor had little in it beside the upright piano because there was
                        no space. But the paper, the carpet and curtains, the few pieces of
                        furniture, showed no evidence of bad taste, of painful failure at the effort
                        to &quot;make a front.&quot; He was in the home of poor people, but
                        they were obviously people who made a highly satisfactory best of their
                        poverty. And in the midst of it all the girl shone like the one evening star
                        in the mystic opalescence of twilight.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We weren&apos;t sure you were coming,&quot; said she.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll call father.... No, I&apos;ll take you back to
                        his workshop. He&apos;s easier to get acquainted with there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you play something for me first? Orperhaps you
                        sing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A very little,&quot; she admitted. &quot;Not worth
                        hearing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sure I&apos;d like it. I want to get used to my
                        surroundings before I tackle thethe biology.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Without either hesitation or shyness, she seated herself at the piano.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll sing the song I&apos;ve just learned.&quot;
                        And she began. Norman moved to the chair that gave him a view of her in
                        profile. For the next five minutes he was witness to one of those rare,
                        altogether charming visions that linger in the memory in freshness and
                        fragrance until memory itself fades away. She sat very straight at the
                        piano, and the position brought <pb id="VAA2369-122" n="118"/> out all the
                        long lines of her figurethe long, round white neck and throat, the long back
                        and bosom, the long arms and legsa series of lovely curves. It has been
                        scientifically demonstrated that pale blue is preeminently the sex color. It
                        certainly was preminently <hi rend="i">her</hi> color, setting off each and
                        every one of her charms and suggesting the roundness and softness and
                        whiteness her drapery concealed. She was one of those rare beings whose
                        every pose is instinct with grace. And her voice It was small, rather high,
                        at times almost shrill. But in every note of its register there sounded a
                        mysterious, melancholy-sweet call to the responding nerves of man.</p>
                    <p>Before she got halfway through the song Norman was fighting against the same
                        mad impulse that had all but overwhelmed him as he watched her in the
                        afternoon. And when her last note rose, swelled, slowly faded into silence,
                        it seemed to him that had she kept on for one note more he would have
                        disclosed to her amazed eyes the insanity raging within him.</p>
                    <p>She turned on the piano stool, her hands dropped listlessly in her lap.
                        &quot;Aren&apos;t those words beautiful?&quot; she said in a
                        dreamy voice. She was not looking at him. Evidently she was hardly aware of
                        his presence.</p>
                    <p>He had not heard a word. He was in no mood for mere words.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve never liked anything so well,&quot; he said. And
                        he lowered his eyes that she might not see what they must be revealing.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-123" n="119"/>
                    <p>She rose. He made a gesture of protest. &quot;Won&apos;t you sing
                        another?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not after that,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s the
                        best I know. It has put me out of the mood for the ordinary songs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are a dreameraren&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s my real life,&quot; replied she. &quot;I go
                        through the other part just to get to the dreams.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you dream?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She laughed carelessly. &quot;Oh, you&apos;d not be interested. It
                        would seem foolish to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re mistaken there,&quot; cried he. &quot;The
                        only thing that ever has interested me in life is dreams and making them
                        come true.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But not <hi rend="i">my</hi> kind of dreams. The only kind I like
                        are the ones that couldn&apos;t possibly come true.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There isn&apos;t any dream that can&apos;t be made to come
                        true.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him eagerly. &quot;You think so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The wildest ones are often the easiest.&quot; He had a moving
                        voice himself, and it had been known to affect listening ears hypnotically
                        when he was deeply in earnest, was possessed by one of those desires that
                        conquer men of will and then make them irresistible instruments.
                        &quot;What is your dream?happiness? ... love?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She gazed past him with swimming eyes, with a glance that seemed like a brave
                        bright bird exploring infinity. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said under her
                        breath. &quot;But it could nevernever come true. It&apos;s too
                        perfect.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-124" n="120"/>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t doubt,&quot; he said, in a tone that fitted her
                        mood as the rhythm of the cradle fits the gentle breathing of the sleeping
                        child. &quot;Don&apos;t ever doubt. And the dream will come
                        true.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have been in love?&quot; she said, under the spell of his
                        look and tone.</p>
                    <p>He nodded slowly. &quot;I am,&quot; he replied, and he was under the
                        spell of her beauty.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is itwonderful?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Like nothing else on earth. Everything else seemspoor and
                        cheapbeside it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He drew a step nearer. &quot;But you couldn&apos;t lovenot yet,
                        &quot;he said. &quot;You haven&apos;t had the experience. You
                        will have to learn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t know me,&quot; she cried. &quot;I have
                        been teaching myself ever since I was a little girl. I&apos;ve thought
                        of nothing else most of the time. Oh&quot; she clasped her white hands
                        against her small bosom&quot;if I ever have the chance, how much I shall
                        give!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know it! I know it!&quot; he replied. &quot;You will make
                        some man happier than ever man was before.&quot; His infatuation did not
                        blind him to the fact that she cared nothing about him, looked on him in the
                        most unpersonal way. But that knowledge seemed only to inflame him the more,
                        to lash him on to the folly of an ill-timed declaration. &quot;I have
                        felt how much you will givehow much you will loveI&apos;ve felt it from
                        the second time I saw youperhaps from the first. I&apos;ve <pb
                            id="VAA2369-125" n="121"/> never seen any woman who interested me as you
                        dowho drew me as you doagainst my ambitionagainst my will. II&quot;</p>
                    <p>He had been fighting against the words that would come in spite of him. He
                        halted now because the flood of emotion suffocated speech. He stood before
                        her, ghastly pale and trembling. She did not draw back. She seemed compelled
                        by his will, by the force of his passion, to stay where she was. But in her
                        eyes was a fascinated terrora fear of himof the passion that dominated him,
                        a passion like the devils that made men gash themselves and leap from
                        precipices into the sea. To unaccustomed eyes the first sight of passion is
                        always terrifying and is usually repellent. One must learn to adventure the
                        big wave, the great hissing, towering billow that conceals behind its menace
                        the wild rapture of infinite longing realized.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have frightened you?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; was her whispered reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But it is your dream come true.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shrank backnot in aversion, but gently. &quot;Noit isn&apos;t my
                        dream,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t realize it yet, but you will.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head positively. &quot;I couldn&apos;t ever think of
                        you in that way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He did not need to ask why. She had already explained when they were talking
                        of Tetlow. There was a finality in her tone that filled him with despair. It
                            <pb id="VAA2369-126" n="122"/> was his turn to look at her in terror.
                        What power this slim delicate girl had over him! What a price she could
                        exact if she but knew I knew? Why, he had told herwas telling her in look
                        and tone and gesturewas giving himself frankly into captivitywas prostrate,
                        inviting her to trample. His only hope of escape lay in her inexperiencethat
                        she would not realize. In the insanities of passion, as in some other forms
                        of dementia, there is always left a streak of reasonof that craft which
                        leads us to try to get what we want as cheaply as possible. Men, all but
                        beside themselves with love, will bargain over the terms, if they be of the
                        bargaining kind by nature. Norman was not a haggler. But common prudence was
                        telling him how unwise his conduct was, how he was inviting the defeat of
                        his own purposes.</p>
                    <p>He waved his hand impatiently. &quot;We&apos;ll see, my
                        dear,&quot; he said with a light good-humored laugh. &quot;I
                        mustn&apos;t forget that I came to see your father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him doubtfully. She did not understanddid not quite likethis
                        abrupt change of mood. It suggested to her simplicity a lack of seriousness,
                        of sincerity. &quot;Do you really wish to see my father?&quot; she
                        inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why else should I come away over to Jersey City? Couldn&apos;t
                        I have talked with you at the office?&quot;</p>
                    <p>This seemed convincing. She continued to study his face for light upon the
                        real character of this strange <pb id="VAA2369-127" n="123"/> new sort of
                        man. He regarded her with a friendly humorous twinkle in his eyes.
                        &quot;Then I&apos;ll take you to him,&quot; she said at length.
                        She was by no means satisfied, but she could not discover why she was
                        dissatisfied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t possibly do you any harm,&quot; he urged, with
                        raillery.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I think not,&quot; replied she gravely. &quot;But you
                        mustn&apos;t say those things!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not?&quot; Into his eyes came their strongest, most
                        penetrating look. &quot;I want you. And I don&apos;t intend to give
                        you up. It isn&apos;t my habit to give up. So, sooner or later I get
                        what I go after.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You make meafraid,&quot; she said nervously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of what?&quot; laughed he. &quot;Not of me, certainly. Then
                        it must be of yourself. You are afraid you will end by wanting me to want
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nonot that,&quot; declared she, confused by his quick
                        cleverness of speech. &quot;I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m
                        afraid of.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then let&apos;s go to your father.... You&apos;ll not tell
                        Tetlow what I&apos;ve said?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot; And once more her simple negation gave him a sense of
                        her absolute truthfulness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Or that I&apos;ve been here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked astonished. &quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ohoffice reasons. It wouldn&apos;t do for the others to
                        know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She reflected on this. &quot;I don&apos;t understand,&quot; was
                            <pb id="VAA2369-128" n="124"/> the result of her thinking. &quot;But
                        I&apos;ll do as you ask. Only, you must not come again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not? If they knew at the office, they&apos;d simply
                        talkunpleasantly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she admitted hesitatingly after reflecting.
                        &quot;So you mustn&apos;t come again. I don&apos;t like some
                        kinds of secrets.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But your father will know,&quot; he urged.
                        &quot;Isn&apos;t that enough forfor propriety?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t explain. I don&apos;t understand, myself. I do
                        a lot of things by instinct.&quot; She, standing with her hands behind
                        her back and with clear, childlike eyes gravely upon him, looked puzzled but
                        resolved. &quot;And my instinct tells me not to do anything secret about
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This answer made him wonder whether after all he might not be too positive in
                        his derisive disbelief in women&apos;s instincts. He laughed.
                        &quot;Wellnow for your father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The workshop proved to be an annex to the rear, reached by a passage leading
                        past a cosy little dining room and a kitchen where the order and the shine
                        of cleanness were notable even to masculine eyes. &quot;You are well
                        taken care of,&quot; he said to hershe was preceding him to show the
                        way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We take care of ourselves,&quot; replied she. &quot;I get
                        breakfast before I leave and supper after I come home. Father has a cold
                        lunch in the middle of the day, when <pb id="VAA2369-129" n="125"/> he eats
                        at allwhich isn&apos;t often. And on Saturday afternoons and Sundays I
                        do the heavy work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You <hi rend="i">are</hi> a busy lady!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, not so very busy. Father is a crank about system and order. He
                        has taught me to plan everything and work by the plans.&quot;</p>
                    <p>For the first time Norman had a glimmer of real interest in meeting her
                        father. For in those remarks of hers he recognized at once the rare superior
                        manthe man who works by plan, where the masses of mankind either drift
                        helplessly or are propelled by some superior force behind them without which
                        they would be, not the civilized beings they seem, but even as the savage in
                        the dugout or as the beast of the field. The girl opened a door; a bright
                        light streamed into the dim hallway.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father!&quot; she called. &quot;Here&apos;s Mr.
                        Norman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman saw, beyond the exquisite profile of the girl&apos;s head and
                        figure, a lean tallish old man, dark and gray, whose expression proclaimed
                        him at first glance no more in touch with the affairs of active life in the
                        world than had he been an inhabitant of Mars.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hallowell gave his caller a polite glance and handshakeevidence of merest
                        surface interest in him, of amiable patience with an intruder. Norman saw in
                        the neatness of his clothing and linen further proof of the girl&apos;s
                        loving care. For no such abstracted personality as this would ever bother
                        about such things <pb id="VAA2369-130" n="126"/> for himself. These details,
                        however, detained Norman only for a moment. In the presence of Hallowell it
                        was impossible not to concentrate upon him.</p>
                    <p>As we grow older what we are inside, the kind of thoughts we admit as our
                        intimates, appears ever more strongly in the countenance. This had often
                        struck Norman, observing the men of importance about him, noting how as they
                        aged the look of respectability, of intellectual distinction, became a
                        thinner and ever thinner veneer over the selfishness and greediness, the
                        vanity and sensuality and falsehood. But never before had he been so deeply
                        impressed by its truth. Evidently Hallowell during most of his fifty-five or
                        sixty years had lived the purely intellectual life. The result was a look of
                        spiritual beauty, the look of the soul living in the high mountain, with
                        serenity and vast views constantly before it. Such a face fills with awe the
                        ordinary follower of the petty life of the world if he have the brains to
                        know or to suspect the ultimate truth about existence. It filled Norman with
                        awe. He hastily turned his eyes upon the girland once more into his face
                        came the resolute, intense, white-hot expression of a man doggedly set upon
                        an earthy purpose.</p>
                    <p>There was an embarrassed silence. Then the girl said, &quot;Show him the
                        worms, father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hallowell smiled. &quot;My little girl thinks no one has seen that
                        sort of thing,&quot; said he. &quot;I can&apos;t make her
                        believe it is one of the commonplaces.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-131" n="127"/>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve never had anyone here more ignorant than I,
                        sir,&quot; said Norman. &quot;The only claim on your courtesy I can
                        make is that I&apos;m interested and that I perhaps know enough in a
                        general way to appreciate.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hallowell waved his hand toward a row of large glass bottles on one of the
                        many shelves built against the rough walls of the room. &quot;Here they
                        are,&quot; said he. &quot;It&apos;s the familiar illustration of
                        how life may be controlled.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t understand,&quot; said Norman, eying the
                        bottled worms curiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, it&apos;s simply the demonstration that life is a mere
                        chemical process&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman had ceased to listen. The girl was moving toward the door by which
                        they had enteredwas in the doorwaywas gone! He stood in an attitude of
                        attention; Hallowell talked on and on, passing from one thing to another,
                        forgetting his caller and himself, thinking only of the subject, the beloved
                        science, that has brought into the modern world a type of men like those who
                        haunted the deserts and mountain caves in the days when Rome was falling to
                        pieces. With those saintly hermits of the Dark Ages religion was the
                        allabsorbing subject. And seeking their own salvation was the goal upon
                        which their ardent eyes were necessarily bent. With these modern devotees,
                        sciencethe search for the truth about the world in which they liveis their
                        religion; and their goal is the redemption of <pb id="VAA2369-132" n="128"/>
                        the world. They are resolvedstep by step, each worker contributing his mite
                        of discoveryto transform the world from a hell of discomfort and pain and
                        death to a heaven where men and women, free and enlightened and perhaps
                        immortal, shall live in happiness. They even dream that perhaps this race of
                        gods shall learn to construct the means to take them to another and younger
                        planet, when this Earth has become too old and too cold and too nakedly clad
                        in atmosphere properly to sustain life.</p>
                    <p>From time to time Norman caught a few words of what Hallowell saidwords that
                        made him respect the intelligence that had uttered them. But he neither
                        cared nor dared to listen. He refused to be deflected from his one purpose.
                        When he was as old as Hallo-well, it would be time to think of these
                        matters. When he had snatched the things he needed, it would be time to take
                        the generous, wide, philosopher view of life. But not yet. He was still
                        young; he couldand he would!drink of the sparkling heady life of the senses,
                        typefied now for him in this girl. How her loveliness flamed in his
                        bloodflamed as fiercely when he could not see the actual, tangible charms as
                        when they were radiating their fire into his eyes and through his skin!
                        First he must live that glorious life of youth, of nerves aquiver with
                        ecstasy. Also, he must shut out the things of the intellectmust live in
                        brain as well as in body the animal lifein brain the life of cunning and <pb
                            id="VAA2369-133" n="129"/> strategy. For the intellectual life would
                        make it impossible to pursue such ignoble things. First, material success
                        and material happiness. Then, in its own time, this intellectual life to
                        which such men as Hallowell ever beckon, from their heights, such men as
                        Norman, deep in the wallow that seems to them unworthy of them, even as they
                        roll in it.</p>
                    <p>As soon as there came a convenient pause in Hallowell&apos;s talk, Norman
                        said, &quot;And you devote your whole life to these things?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hallowell&apos;s countenance lost its fine glow of enthusiasm.
                        &quot;I have to make a living. I do chemical analyses for doctors and
                        druggists. That takes most of my time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you can dispatch those things quickly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hallowell shook his head. &quot;There&apos;s only one way to do
                        things. My clients trust me. I can&apos;t shirk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman smiled. He admired this simplicity. But it amused him, too; in a world
                        of shirking and shuffling, not to speak of downright dishonesty, it struck
                        the humorous note of the incongruous. He said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;But if you could give all your time you would get on
                        faster.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesif I had the time<hi rend="i">and</hi> the money. To make the
                        search exhaustive would take moneyfive or six thousand a year, at the least.
                        A great deal more than I shall ever have.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Have you tried to interest capitalists?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-134" n="130"/>
                    <p>Hallowell smiled ironically. &quot;There is much talk about capitalists
                        and capital opening up things. But I have yet to learn of an instance of
                        their touching anything until they were absolutely sure of large profits.
                        Their failed enterprises are not miscarriage of noble purpose but mistaken
                        judgment, judgment blinded by hope and greed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see that a philosopher can know life without living it,&quot;
                        said Norman. &quot;But couldn&apos;t you put your scheme in such a
                        way that some capitalist would be led to hope?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d have to tell them the truth. Possibly I might discover
                        something with commercial value, but I couldn&apos;t promise. I
                        don&apos;t think it is likely.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman&apos;s eyes were on the door. His thoughts were reaching out to
                        the distant and faint sound of a piano. &quot;Just what do you propose
                        to search for?&quot; inquired he.</p>
                    <p>He tried to listen, because it was necessary that he have some knowledge of
                        Hallowell&apos;s plans. But he could not fix his attention. After a few
                        moments he glanced at his watch, interrupted with, &quot;I think I
                        understand enough for the present. I&apos;ve stayed longer than I
                        intended. I must go now. When I come again I may perhaps have some plan to
                        propose.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Plan?&quot; exclaimed Hallowell, his eyes lighting up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not surenot at all sure,&quot; hastily added
                        Norman. &quot;I don&apos;t wish to give you false hopes. The <pb
                            id="VAA2369-135" n="131"/> matter is extremely difficult. But
                        I&apos;ll try. I&apos;ve small hope of success, but I&apos;ll
                        try.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My daughter didn&apos;t explain to me,&quot; said the
                        scientist. &quot;She simply said one of the gentlemen for whom she
                        worked was coming to look at my place. I thought it was mere
                        curiosity.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So it was, Mr. Hallowell,&quot; said Norman. &quot;But I
                        have been interested. I don&apos;t as yet see what can be done.
                        I&apos;m only saying that I&apos;ll think it over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I understand,&quot; said Hallowell. He was trying to seem calm
                        and indifferent. But his voice had the tremulous note of excitement in it
                        and his hands fumbled nervously, touching evidence of the agitated gropings
                        of his mind in the faint, perhaps illusory, light of a new-sprung hope.
                        &quot;Yes, I understand, perfectly. Stillit is pleasant to think about
                        such a thing, even if there&apos;s no chance of it. I am very fond of
                        dreaming. That has been my life, you know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman colored, moved uneasily. The fineness of this man&apos;s character
                        made him uncomfortable. He could pity Hallowell as a misguided failure. He
                        could dilate himself as prosperous, successful, much the more imposing and
                        important figure in the contrast. Yet there was somehow a point of view at
                        which, if one looked carefully, his own sort of man shriveled and the
                        Hallowell sort towered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I <hi rend="i">must</hi> be going,&quot; Norman said.
                        &quot;Nodon&apos;t come with me. I know the way. I&apos;ve
                        interrupted you <pb id="VAA2369-136" n="132"/> long enough.&quot; And he
                        put out his hand and, by those little clevernesses of manner which he
                        understood so well, made it impossible for Hallowell to go with him to
                        Dorothy.</p>
                    <p>He was glad when he shut the door between him and her father. He paused in
                        the hall to dispel the vague, self-debasing discomfortand listening to <hi
                            rend="i">her</hi> voice as she sang helped wonderfully. There is no more
                        trying test of a personality than to be estimated by the voice alone. That
                        test produces many strange and startling results. Again and again it
                        completely reverses our judgment of the personality, either destroys or
                        enhances its charm. The voice of this girl, floating out upon the quiet of
                        the cottagethe voice, soft and sweet, full of the virginal passion of dreams
                        unmarred by experience It was while listening to her voice, as he stood
                        there in the dimly lighted hall, that Frederick Norman passed under the
                        spell in all its potency. In taking an ansthetic there is the stage when we
                        reach out for its soothing effects; then comes the stage when we half
                        desire, half fear; then a stage in which fear is dominant, and we struggle
                        to retain our control of the senses. Last comes the stage when we feel the
                        full power of the drug and relax and yield or are beaten down into quiet.
                        Her voice drew him into the final stage, was the blow of the overwhelming
                        wave&apos;s crest that crushed him into submission.</p>
                    <p>She glanced toward the door. He was leaning <pb id="VAA2369-137" n="133"/>
                        there, an ominous calm in his pale, resolute face. She gazed at him with
                        widening eyes. And her look was the look of helplessness before a force that
                        may, indeed must, be struggled against, but with the foregone certainty of
                        defeat.</p>
                    <p>A gleam of triumph shone in his eyes. Then his expression changed to one more
                        conventional. &quot;I stopped a moment to listen, on my way
                        out,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>Her expression changed also. The instinctive, probably unconscious response
                        to his look faded into the sweet smile, serious rather than merry, that was
                        her habitual greeting. &quot;Mr. Tetlow didn&apos;t get away from
                        father so soon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I stayed longer than I intended. I found it even more interesting
                        than I had expected... Would you be glad if your father could be free to do
                        as he likes and not be worried about anything?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is one of my dreams.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it&apos;s certainly one that might come true... And you
                        It&apos;s a shame that you should have to do so much drudgeryboth here
                        and in New York.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t mind about myself. It&apos;s all
                        I&apos;m fit for. I haven&apos;t any talentexcept for
                        dreaming.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And for making<hi rend="i">some</hi> man&apos;s dreams come
                        true.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her gaze dropped. And as she hid herself she looked once more almost as
                        insignificant and colorless as he had once believed her to be.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-138" n="134"/>
                    <p>She shook her head slowly without raising her eyes or emerging from the deep
                        recess of her reserve.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are a mystery to me. I can&apos;t decide whether you are
                        very innocent or veryconcealing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She glanced inquiringly at him. &quot;I don&apos;t
                        understand,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>He smiled. &quot;No more do I. I&apos;ve seen so much of fakingin
                        women as well as in menthat it&apos;s hard for me to believe anyone is
                        genuine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think I am trying to deceive you? About what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He made an impatient gestureimpatience with his credulity where she was
                        concerned. &quot;No matter. I want to make you happybecause I want you
                        to make me happy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her eyes became as grave as a wondering child&apos;s. &quot;You are
                        laughing at me,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why do you say that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because I could not make you happy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What could a serious man like you find in me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>His intense, burning gaze held hers. &quot;Some time I will tell
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shut herself within herself like a flower folding away its beauty and
                        leaving exposed only the colorless underside of its petals. It was
                        impossible to say whether she understood or was merely obeying an instinct.</p>
                    <p>He watched her a moment in silence. Then he said:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-139" n="135"/>
                    <p>&quot;I am mad about youmad. You <hi rend="i">must</hi> understand. I can
                        think only of you. I am insane with jealousy of you. I want youI must have
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He would have seized her in his arms, but the look of sheer amazement she
                        gave him protected her where no protest or struggle would.
                        &quot;You?&quot; she said. &quot;Did you really mean it? I
                        thought you were just talking.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t you see that I mean it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesyou look as if you did. But I can&apos;t believe it. I could
                        never think of you in that way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Once more that frank statement of indifference infuriated him. He <hi
                            rend="i">must</hi> compel her to feelhe must give that indifference the
                        lieand at once! He caught her in his arms. He rained kisses upon her pale
                        face. She made not the least resistance, but seemed dazed. &quot;I will
                        teach you to love me,&quot; he cried, drunk now with the wine of her
                        lips, with the perfume of her exquisite youth. &quot;I will make you
                        happy. We shall be mad with happiness.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She gently freed herself. &quot;I don&apos;t believe I could ever
                        think of you in that way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, darlingyou will. You can&apos;t help loving where you are
                        loved so utterly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She gazed at him wonderinglythe puzzled wonder of a child.
                        &quot;Youloveme?&quot; she said slowly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Call it what you like. I am mad about you. I have forgotten

                    <p>And again he was kissing her with the soft fury of fire; and again she was
                        submitting with the passive, dazed expression that seemed to add to his
                        passion. To make her feel! To make her respond! He, whom so many women had
                        lovedwomen of position, of fame for beauty, of social distinction or
                        distinction as singers, playerswomen of society and women of talentall kinds
                        of worth-while womenthey had cared, had run after him, had given freely all
                        he had asked and more. And this girlnobody at allshe had nothing for him.</p>
                    <p>He held her away from him, cried angrily: &quot;What is the matter with
                        you? What is the matter with me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t understand,&quot; she said. &quot;I wish
                        you wouldn&apos;t kiss me so much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He released her, laughed satirically. &quot;Ohyou are playing a game. I
                        might have known.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t understand,&quot; said she. &quot;A while
                        ago you said you loved me. Now you act as if you didn&apos;t like me at
                        all.&quot; And she smiled gayly at him, pouting her lips a little. Once
                        more her beauty was shining. It made his nerves quiver to see the color in
                        her pure white skin where he had kissed her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t care whether it is a game or not,&quot; he
                        cried. And he was about to seize her again, when she repulsed him. He
                        crushed her resistance, held her tight in his arms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You frighten me,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Youhurt
                        me.&quot;</p>

                    <p>He released her. &quot;What do you want?&quot; he cried.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t you care at all?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes. I like youvery much. I have from the first time I saw you.
                        But you seem olderand more serious.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never mind about that. We are going to love each otherand I am
                        going to make you and your father happy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you make father happy I will do anything for you. I
                        don&apos;t want anything myselfbut he is getting old and sometimes his
                        despair is terrible.&quot; There were tears in her voicetears and the
                        most touching tenderness. &quot;He has some great secret that he wants
                        to discover, and he is afraid he will die without having had the
                        chance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will love me if I make your father happy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He knew it was the question of a fool, but he so longed to hear from her lips
                        some word to give him hope that he could not help asking it. She said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Love you asas you seem to love me? Not that same way. I
                        don&apos;t feel that way toward you. But I will love you in my own
                        way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He observed her with penetrating eyes. Was this speech of hers innocence or
                        calculation? He could get no clue to the truth. He saw nothing but
                        innocence; the teaching of experience warned him to believe in nothing but
                        guile. He hid his doubt and chagrin behind a mocking smile. &quot;As you
                        please,&quot; said he. &quot;I <pb id="VAA2369-142" n="138"/> will
                        do my part. Thenwe&apos;ll see... Do you care about anyone elsein <hi
                            rend="i">my</hi> way of loving, I mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was again the question of an infatuated fool, and put in an infatuated
                        fool&apos;s way. For, if she were a &quot;deep one,&quot; how
                        could he hope to get the truth? But her answer reassured him.
                        &quot;No,&quot; she saidher simple, direct negation that had a
                        convincing power he had never seen equaled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I ever knew of another man&apos;s touching you,&quot; he
                        said, &quot;I&apos;d feel like strangling him.&quot; He laughed
                        at himself. &quot;Not that I should strangle him. That sort of thing
                        isn&apos;t done any more. But I&apos;d do something
                        devilish.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I haven&apos;t promised not to kiss anyone else,&quot;
                        she said. &quot;Why should I? I don&apos;t love you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her strangely. &quot;But you&apos;re going to love
                        me,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>She shrank within herself again. She looked at him with uneasy eyes.
                        &quot;You won&apos;t kiss me any more until I tell you that I do
                        love you?&quot; she asked with the gravity and pathos and helplessness
                        of a child.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you want to learn to love me?to learn to
                        Love?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was silenta silence that maddened him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t be afraid to speak,&quot; he said irritably.
                        &quot;What are you thinking?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That I don&apos;t want you to kiss meand that I do want father
                        to be happy.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-143" n="139"/>
                    <p>&quot;Was this guile? Was it innocence? He put his arms round her.
                        &quot;Look at me,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>She gazed at him frankly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You like me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you want me to kiss you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know. It makes medislike you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He released her. She laid her hand on his arm eagerly.
                        &quot;Please&quot; she implored. &quot;I don&apos;t mean to
                        hurt you. I wouldn&apos;t offend you for anything. Onlywhen you ask me a
                        questionmustn&apos;t I tell you the truth?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Always,&quot; he said, believing in her, in spite of the
                        warnings of cynical worldliness. &quot;I don&apos;t know whether you
                        are sincere or notas yet. So for the present I&apos;ll give you the
                        benefit of the doubt.&quot; He stood back and looked at her from head to
                        foot. &quot;You are beautiful!perfect,&quot; he said in a low voice.
                        He laughed. &quot;I&apos;ll resist the temptation to kiss you again.
                        I must go now. About your fatherI&apos;ll see what can be
                        done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She stood with her hands behind her back, looking up at him with an
                        expression he could not fathom. Suddenly she advanced, put up her lips and
                        said gravely, &quot;Won&apos;t you kiss me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He eyed her quizzically. &quot;Ohyou&apos;ve changed your
                        mind?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then why do you ask me to kiss you?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-144" n="[140]"/>
                    <p>&quot;Because of what you said about father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He laughed and kissed her. And then she, too, laughed. He said, &quot;Not
                        for my own sakenot a little bit?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; she cried, &quot;when you kiss me that way.
                        I like to be kissed. I am very affectionate.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He laughed again. &quot;You <hi rend="i">are</hi> a queer one. If
                        it&apos;s a game, it&apos;s a good one. Is it a game?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said she gayly. &quot;Good
                        night. This is dreadfully late for me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good night,&quot; he said, and they shook hands. &quot;Do
                        you like me betteror less?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Better,&quot; was her prompt, apparently honest reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Curiously enough, I&apos;m beginning to <hi rend="i">like</hi>
                        you,&quot; said he. &quot;Now don&apos;t ask me what I mean by
                        that. If you don&apos;t know already, you&apos;ll not find out from
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, but I do know,&quot; cried she. &quot;The way you
                        kissed methat was one thing. The way you feel toward me nowthat&apos;s a
                        different thing. Isn&apos;t it so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Exactly. I see we are going to get on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, indeed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They shook hands again in friendliest fashion, and she opened the front door
                        for him. And her farewell smile was bright and happy.</p>

                        account of stockwith dismal results. She had wound him round her fingers,
                        had made him say only the things he should not have said, and leave unsaid
                        the things that might have furthered his purposes. He had conducted the
                        affair ridiculously&quot;just what is to be expected of an infatuated
                        fool.&quot; However, there was no consolation in the discovery that he
                        was reduced, after all these years of experience, to the common levelman
                        weak and credulous in his dealings with woman. He hoped that his disgust
                        with himself would lead on to disgust, or, rather, distaste for her. It is
                        the primal instinct of vanity to dislike and to shun those who have
                        witnessed its humiliation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I believe I am coming to my senses,&quot; he said. And he
                        ventured to call her up before him for examination and criticism. This as he
                        stood upon the forward deck of the ferry with the magnificent panorama of
                        New York before him. New York! And he, of its strong men, of the few in all

                        excursion of his! And for what? There he summoned her before him. And at the
                        first glance of his fancy at her fair sweet face and lovely figure, he
                        quailed. He was hearing her voice again. He was feeling the yield of her
                        smooth, round form to his embrace, the yield of her smooth white cheek to
                        his caress. In his nostrils was the fragrance of her youth, the matchless
                        perfume of nature, beyond any of the distillations of art in its appeal to
                        his normal and healthy nerves. And he burned with the fire only she could
                        quench. &quot;I mustI must!My God, I <hi rend="i">must!</hi>&quot;
                        he muttered.</p>
                    <p>When he reached home, he asked whether his sister was in. The butler said
                        that Mrs. Fitzhugh had just come from the theater. In search of her, he went
                        to the library, found her seated there with a book and a cigarette, her wrap
                        thrown back upon her chair. &quot;Come out to supper with me,
                        Ursula,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m starved and
                        bored.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, you&apos;re not dressed!&quot; exclaimed his sister.

                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t eat, but I&apos;ll drink. Yes, let&apos;s
                        have a spree. It&apos;s been years since we had onenot since we were
                        poor. Let&apos;s not go to a <hi rend="i">deadly</hi> respectable place.

                    <p>&quot;But I must have food. Why not the Martin?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;ll dothough I&apos;d prefer something a little
                        farther up Broadway.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Martin is gay enough. The truth is, there&apos;s nothing
                        really gay any more. There&apos;s too much money. Money suffocates
                        gayety.&quot;</p>
                    <p>To the Martin they went, and he ordered an enormous supperone of those
                        incredible meals for which he was famous. They dispatched a quart of
                        champagne before the supper began to come, he drinking at least two thirds
                        of it. He drank as much while he was eatingand called for a third bottle
                        when the coffee was served. He had eaten half a dozen big oysters, a whole
                        guinea hen, a whole portion of salad, another of Boniface cheese, with
                        innumerable crackers.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I could eat as you do!&quot; sighed Ursula enviously.
                        &quot;Yet it&apos;s only one of your accomplishments.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not eating much nowadays,&quot; said he gloomily.
                        &quot;I&apos;m losing my appetite.&quot; And he lit a long black
                        cigar and swallowed half a large glass of the champagne. &quot;Nothing
                        tastes goodnot even champagne.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There <hi rend="i">is</hi> something wrong with you,&quot; said
                        Ursula. &quot;Did you ask me out for confidences, or for adviceor for

                    <p>&quot;None of them,&quot; replied he. &quot;Only for company. I
                        knew I&apos;d not be able to sleep for hours, and I wanted to put off
                        the time when I&apos;d be alone.&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;Influence? Don&apos;t I do whatever you say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She laughed. &quot;Nobody has influence over you,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not even myself,&quot; replied he morosely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wellthat talking-to you gave me has had its effect,&quot;
                        proceeded Mrs. Fitzhugh. &quot;It set me to thinking. There are other
                        things besides loveman and woman love. I&apos;ve decided toto behave
                        myself and give poor Clayton a chance to rest.&quot; She smiled, a
                        little maliciously. &quot;He&apos;s had a horrible fright. But
                        it&apos;s over now. What a fine thing it is for a woman to have a
                        sensible brother!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman grunted, took another liberal draught of the champagne.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I had a mind like yours!&quot; pursued Ursula.
                        &quot;Now, you simply couldn&apos;t make a fool of
                        yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her sharply. He felt as if she had somehow got wind of his
                        eccentric doings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve always resented your rather contemptuous attitude
                        toward women,&quot; she went on. &quot;But you are rightreally you
                        are. We&apos;re none of us worth the excitement men make about
                        us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It isn&apos;t the woman who makes a fool of the man,&quot;
                        said Norman. &quot;It&apos;s the man who makes a fool of himself. A
                        match can cause a terrific explosion if it&apos;s in the right placebut
                        not if it isn&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-149" n="145"/>
                    <p>She nodded. &quot;That&apos;s it. We&apos;re simply matchesand
                        most of us of the poor sputtering kind that burns with a bad odor and goes
                        out right away. A very inferior quality of matches.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; repeated Norman, &quot;it&apos;s the man who
                        does the whole business.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A mocking smile curled her lips. &quot;I knew you weren&apos;t in
                        love with Josephine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stared gloomily at his cigar.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you&apos;re going to marry her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m in love with her,&quot; he said angrily.
                        &quot;And I&apos;m going to marry her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She eyed him shrewdly. &quot;Fredare you in love with some one
                        else?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He did not answer immediately. When he did it was with a
                        &quot;No&quot; that seemed the more emphatic for the delay.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, just one of your little affairs.&quot; And she began to
                        poke fun at him. &quot;I thought you had dropped that sort of thing for
                        good and all. I hope Josie won&apos;t hear of it. She&apos;d not
                        understand. Women never dounless they don&apos;t care a rap about the
                        man.... Is she on the stage? I know you&apos;ll not tell me, but I like
                        to ask.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her brother looked at her rather wildly. &quot;Let&apos;s go
                        home,&quot; he said. He was astounded and alarmed by the discovery that
                        his infatuation had whirled him to the lunacy of longing to confideand he
                        feared lest, if <pb id="VAA2369-150" n="146"/> he should stay on, he would
                        blurt out his disgraceful secret. &quot;Waiter, the bill.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t let&apos;s go yet,&quot; urged his sister.
                        &quot;The most interesting people are beginning to come. Besides, I want
                        more champagne.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He yielded. While she gazed round with the air of a visitor to a Zoo that is
                        affected by fashionable people, and commented on the faces, figures, and
                        clothes of the women, he stared at his plate and smoked and drank. Finally
                        she said, &quot;I&apos;d give anything to see you make a fool of
                        yourself, just once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He grinned. &quot;Things are in the way to having your wish
                            <unclear>gratifi----</unclear> he said. &quot;It looks to me as if
                        my time had come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She tried to conceal her anxiety. &quot;Are you serious?&quot; she
                        asked. Then added: &quot;Of course not. You simply couldn&apos;t.
                        Especially nowwhen Josephine might hear. I suppose you&apos;ve noticed
                        how Joe Culver is hanging round her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He nodded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s no dangerunless&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall marry Josephine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not if she hears.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s not going to hear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t be too sure. Women love to boast. It tickles their
                        vanity to have a man. Yes, they pretend to be madly in love simply to give
                        themselves the excuse for tattling.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-151" n="147"/>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;ll not hear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can&apos;t be sure.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want you to help me out. I&apos;m going to tell her
                        I&apos;m tremendously busy these few next daysor weeks.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Weeks!&quot; Ursula Fitzhugh laughed. &quot;My, it must be
                        serious!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Weeks,&quot; repeated her brother. &quot;And I want you to
                        say things that&apos;ll help outand to see a good deal of her.&quot;
                        He flung down his cigar. &quot;You women don&apos;t understand how
                        it is with a man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t we though! Why, it&apos;s a very ordinary
                        occurrence for a woman to be really in love with several men at
                        once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His eyes gleamed jealously. &quot;I don&apos;t believe it,&quot;
                        he cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not Josephine,&quot; she said reassuringly.
                        &quot;She&apos;s one of those single-hearted, untemperamental women.
                        They concentrate. They have no imagination.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wasn&apos;t thinking of Josephine,&quot; said he
                        sullenly. &quot;To go back to what I was saying, I am in love with
                        Josephine and with no one else. I can&apos;t explain to you how or why
                        I&apos;m entangled. But I&apos;ll get myself untangled all rightand
                        very shortly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know that, Fred. You aren&apos;t the permanent-damn-fool
                        sort.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should say not!&quot; exclaimed he. &quot;It&apos;s a
                        hopeful sign that I know exactly how big a fool I am.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head in strong dissent. &quot;On the contrary,&quot;
                            <pb id="VAA2369-152" n="148"/> said she, &quot;it&apos;s a bad
                        sign. I didn&apos;t realize I was making a fool of myself until you
                        pointed it out to me. That stopped me. If I had been doing it with my eyes
                        open, your jacking me up would only have made me go ahead.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A woman&apos;s different. It doesn&apos;t take much to stop
                        a woman. She&apos;s about half stopped when she begins.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ursula was thoroughly alarmed. &quot;Fred,&quot; she said earnestly,
                        &quot;you&apos;re running bang into danger. The time to stop is
                        right now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t do it,&quot; he said. &quot;Let&apos;s
                        not talk about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t? That word from <hi rend="i">you?</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;From me,&quot; replied he. &quot;Don&apos;t forget
                        helping out with Josephine. Let&apos;s go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And he refused to be persuaded to stay onor to be cajoled or baited into
                        talking further of this secret his sister saw was weighing heavily.</p>
                    <p>He was down town half an hour earlier than usual the next morning. But no one
                        noted it because his habit had always been to arrive among the firstnot to
                        set an example but to give his prodigious industry the fullest swing. There
                        was in Turkey a great poet of whom it is said that he must have written
                        twenty-five hours a day. Norman&apos;s accomplishment bulked in that
                        same way before his associates. He had not slept the whole night. But,
                        thanks to his enormous vitality, no trace of this serious dissipation
                        showed. The huge <pb id="VAA2369-153" n="149"/> supper he had eatenand
                        drunkthe sleepless night and the giant breakfast of fruit and cereal and
                        chops and wheat cakes and coffee he had laid in to stay him until lunch
                        time, would together have given pause to any but such a physical
                        organization as his. The only evidence of it was a certain slight
                        irritabilitybut this may have been due to his state of intense
                        self-dissatisfaction.</p>
                    <p>As he entered the main room his glance sought the corner where Miss Hallowell
                        was ensconced. She happened to look up at that instant. With a radiant smile
                        she bowed to him in friendliest fashion. He colored deeply, frowned with
                        annoyance, bowed coldly and strode into his room. He fussed and fretted
                        about with his papers for a few minutes, then rang the bell.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Send in Miss Pritchardno, Mr. Gowdyno, Miss Hallowell,&quot; he
                        said to the office boy. And then he looked sharply at the pert young face
                        for possible signs of secret cynical amusement. He saw none such, but was
                        not convinced. He knew too well how by a sort of occult process the
                        servants, all the subordinates, round a person like himself discover the
                        most intimate secrets, almost get the news before anything has really
                        occurred.</p>
                    <p>Miss Hallowell appeared, and very cold and reserved she looked as she stood
                        waiting.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I sent for you because&quot; he began. He glanced at the door
                        to make sure that it was closed&quot;because <pb id="VAA2369-154"
                            n="150"/> I wanted to hear your voice.&quot; And he laughed
                        boyishly. He was in high good humor now.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why did you speak to me as you did when you came in?&quot; said
                        she.</p>
                    <p>There was certainly novelty in this direct attack, this equal to equal
                        criticism of his manners. He was not pleased with the novelty; but at the
                        same time he felt a lack of the courage to answer her as she deserved, even
                        if she was playing a clever game. &quot;It isn&apos;t necessary that
                        the whole office should know our private business,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>She seemed astonished. &quot;What private business?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Last night,&quot; said he, uncertain whether she was trifling
                        with him or was really the innocent she pretended to be. &quot;If I were
                        you, I&apos;d not speak as friendlily as you did this morningnot before
                        people.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot; inquired she, her sweet young face still more
                        perplexed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This isn&apos;t a small town out West,&quot; explained he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s New York. People misunderstandor rather&quot; He
                        gave her a laughing, mischievous glance &quot;or ratherthey
                        don&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t see anything to make a mystery about,&quot;
                        declared the girl. &quot;Why, you act as if there were something to be
                        ashamed of in coming to see me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was observing her sharply. How could a girl live in the New York
                        atmosphere several years without getting a sensible point of view? Yet, so
                        far as he <pb id="VAA2369-155" n="151"/> could judge, this girl was
                        perfectly honest in her ignorance. &quot;Don&apos;t be
                        foolish,&quot; said he. &quot;Please accept the fact as I give it to
                        you. You mustn&apos;t let people see everything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She made no attempt to conceal her dislike for this. &quot;I
                        won&apos;t be mixed up in anything like that,&quot; said she, quite
                        gently and without a suggestion of pique or anger. &quot;It makes me
                        feel lowand it&apos;s horribly common. Either we are going to be friends
                        or we aren&apos;t. And if we are, why, we&apos;re friends whenever
                        we meet. I&apos;m not ashamed of you. And if you are ashamed of me, you
                        can cut me out altogether.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His color deepened until his face was crimson. His eyes avoided hers.
                        &quot;I was thinking chiefly of you,&quot; he saidand he honestly
                        thought he was speaking the whole truth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then please don&apos;t do so any more,&quot; said she,
                        turning to go. &quot;I understand about New York snobbishness. I want
                        nothing to do with it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He disregarded the danger of the door being opened at any moment. He rushed
                        to her and took her reluctant hand. &quot;You mustn&apos;t blame me
                        for the ways of the world. I can&apos;t change them. Do be sensible,
                        dearest. You&apos;re only going to be here a few days longer.
                        I&apos;ve got that plan for you and your father all thought out.
                        I&apos;ll put it through at once. I don&apos;t want the office
                        talking scandal about usdo you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him pityingly. His eyes fell before <pb id="VAA2369-156"
                            n="152"/> hers. &quot;I know it&apos;s a weakness,&quot; he
                        said, giving up trying to deceive her and himself. &quot;But I
                        can&apos;t help it. I was brought up that way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well<hi rend="i">I</hi> wasn&apos;t. I see we can never be
                        friends.&quot;</p>
                    <p>What a mess he had made of this affair! This girl must be playing upon him.
                        In his folly he had let her see how completely he was in her power, and she
                        was using that power to establish relations between them that were the very
                        opposite of what he desiredand must have. He must control himself.
                        &quot;As you please,&quot; he said coldly, dropping her hand.
                        &quot;I&apos;m sorry, but unless you are reasonable I can do nothing
                        for you.&quot; And he went to his desk.</p>
                    <p>She hesitated a moment; as her back was toward him, he could not see her
                        expression. Without looking round she went out of his office. It took all
                        his strength to let her go. &quot;She&apos;s bluffing,&quot; he
                        muttered. &quot;And yetperhaps she isn&apos;t. There may be people
                        like that left in New York.&quot; Whatever the truth, he simply must
                        make a stand. He knew women; no woman had the least respect for a man who
                        let her ruleand this woman, relying upon his weakness for her, was bent upon
                        ruling. If he did not make a stand, she was lost to him. If he did make a
                        stand, he could no more than lose her. Lose her! That thought made him sick
                        at heart. &quot;What a fool I am about her!&quot; he cried.
                        &quot;I must hurry things up. I must get enough of hermust get through
                        it and back to my sober senses.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-157" n="153"/>
                    <p>That was a time of heavy pressure of important affairs. He furiously attacked
                        one task after another, only to abandon each in turn. His mind, which had
                        always been his obedient, very humble servant, absolutely refused to obey.
                        He turned everything over to his associates or to subordinates, fighting all
                        morning against the longing to send for her. At half past twelve he strode
                        out of the office, putting on the air of the big man absorbed in big
                        affairs. He descended to the street. But instead of going up town to keep an
                        appointment at a business lunch he hung round the entrance to the opposite
                        building.</p>
                    <p>She did not appear until one o&apos;clock. Then out she camewith the head
                        office boy!the good-looking, young head office boy.</p>
                    <p>Norman&apos;s contempt for himself there reached its lowest ebb. For his
                        blood boiled with jealousyjealousy of his head office boy!and about an
                        obscure little typewriter! He followed the two, keeping to the other side of
                        the street. Doubtless those who saw and recognized him fancied him deep in
                        thought about some mighty problem of corporate law or policy, as he moved
                        from and to some meeting with the great men who dictated to a nation of
                        ninety millions what they should buy and how much they should pay for it. He
                        saw the two enter a quick-lunch restaurantstruggled with a crack-brained
                        impulse to join themdragged himself away to his appointment.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-158" n="154"/>
                    <p>He was never too amiable in dealing with his clients, because he had found
                        that, in self-protection, to avoid being misunderstood and largely
                        increasing the difficulties of amicable intercourse, he must keep the feel
                        of iron very near the surface. That day he was for the first time irascible.
                        If the business his clients were engaged in had been less perilous and his
                        acute intelligence not indispensable, he would have cost the firm dear. But
                        in business circles, where every consideration yields to that of material
                        gain, the man with the brain may conduct himself as he pleasesand usually
                        does so, when he has strength of character.</p>
                    <p>All afternoon he wrestled with himself to keep away from the office. He won,
                        but it was the sort of victory that gives the winner the chagrin and
                        despondency of defeat. At home, late in the afternoon, he found Josephine in
                        the doorway, just leaving. &quot;You&apos;ll walk home with
                        mewon&apos;t you?&quot; she said. And, taken unawares and
                        intimidated by guilt, he could think of no excuse.</p>
                    <p>Some oneprobably a Frenchmanhas said that there are always in a
                        man&apos;s life three womenthe one on the way out, the one that is, and
                        the one that is to be. Normanever the industrious trafficker with the
                        feminine that the man of the intense vitality necessary to a great career of
                        action is apt to bewas by no means new to the situation in which he now
                        found himself. But never before had the circumstances been so difficult.
                        Josephine in no way resembled any woman <pb id="VAA2369-159" n="155"/> with
                        whom he had been involved; she was the first he had taken seriously. Nor did
                        the other woman resemble the central figure in any of his affairs. He did
                        not know what she was like, how to classify her; but he did know that she
                        was unlike any woman he had ever known and that his feeling for her was
                        differentappallingly differentfrom any emotion any other woman had inspired
                        in him. Soa walk alone with Josephinea first talk with her after his secret
                        treacherywas no light matter. &quot;Deeper and deeper,&quot; he said
                        to himself. &quot;Where is this going to end?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She began by sympathizing with him for having so much to do &quot;and
                        father says you can get through more work than any man he ever knew, not
                        excluding himself.&quot; She was full of tenderness and compliment, of a
                        kind of love that made him feel as the dirt beneath his feet. She respected
                        him so highly; she believed in him so entirely. The thought of her
                        discovering the truth, or any part of it, gave him a sensation of nausea. He
                        was watching her out of the corner of his eye. Never had he seen her more
                        statelily beautiful. If he should lose her! &quot;I&apos;m mad<hi
                            rend="i">mad</hi>!&quot; he said to himself. &quot;Josephine is
                        as high above her as heaven above earth. What is there to her, anyhow? Not
                        brainsnor tastenor such miraculous beauty. Why do I make an ass of myself
                        about her? I ought to go to my doctor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t believe you&apos;re listening to what
                        I&apos;m saying,&quot; laughed Josephine.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-160" n="156"/>
                    <p>&quot;My head&apos;s in a terrible state,&quot; replied he.
                        &quot;I can&apos;t think of anything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t try to talk or to listen, dearest,&quot; said
                        she in the sweet and soothing tone that is neither sweet nor soothing to a
                        man in a certain species of unresponsive mood. &quot;This air will do
                        you good. It doesn&apos;t annoy you for me to talk to you, does
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The question was one of those which confidently expects, even demands, a
                        sincere and strenuous negative for answer. It fretted him, this
                        matter-of-course assumption of hers that she could not but be altogether
                        pleasing, not to say enchanting to him. Her position, her wealth, the
                        attentions she had received, the flatteries In her circumstances could it be
                        in human nature not to think extremely well of oneself? And he admitted that
                        she had the right so to think. StillFor the first time she scraped upon his
                        nerves. His reply, &quot;Annoy me? The contrary,&quot; was
                        distinctly crisp. To an experienced ear there would have sounded the faint
                        warning under-note of sullenness.</p>
                    <p>But she, believing in his love and in herself, saw nothing, suspected
                        nothing. &quot;We know each other so thoroughly,&quot; she went on,
                        &quot;that we don&apos;t need to make any effort. How congenial we
                        are! I always understand you. I feel such a sense of the perfect freedom and
                        perfect frankness between us. Don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have wonderful intuitions,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>It was the time to alarm him by coldness, by capriciousness. <pb
                            id="VAA2369-161" n="157"/> But how could she know it? And she was in
                        lovereally in lovenot with herself, not with love, but with him. Thus, she
                        made the mistake of all true lovers in those difficult moments. She let him
                        see how absolutely she was his. Nor did the spectacle of her sincerity, of
                        her belief in his sincerity put him in any better humor with himself.</p>
                    <p>The walk was a mere matter of a dozen blocks. He thought it would never end.
                        &quot;You are sure you aren&apos;t ill?&quot; she said, when
                        they were at her doora superb bronze door it was, opening into a house of
                        the splendor that for the acclimated New Yorker quite conceals and more than
                        compensates absence of individual taste. &quot;You don&apos;t look
                        ill. But you act queerly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m often this way when they drive me too hard down
                        town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him with fond admiration; he might have been better pleased had
                        there not been in the look a suggestion of the possessive. &quot;How
                        they do need you! Father says But I mustn&apos;t make you any vainer
                        than you are.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He usually loved compliment, could take it in its rawest form with fine human
                        gusto. Now, he did not care enough about that &quot;father
                        says&quot; to rise to her obvious bait. &quot;I&apos;m horribly
                        tired,&quot; he said. &quot;Shall I see you to-morrow? No, I guess
                        notnot for several days. You understand?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perfectly,&quot; replied she. &quot;I&apos;ll miss you
                        dreadfully, <pb id="VAA2369-162" n="158"/> but my father has trained me
                        well. I know I mustn&apos;t be selfishand tempt you to neglect
                        things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said he. &quot;I must be off.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll come injust a moment?&quot; Her eyes sparkled.
                        &quot;The butler will have sense enough to go straight awayand the small
                        reception room will be quite empty as usual.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He could not escape. A few seconds and he was alone with her in the little
                        roomhow often had hetheybeen glad of its quiet and seclusion on such
                        occasions! She laid her hand upon his shoulders, gazed at him proudly.
                        &quot;It was here,&quot; said she, &quot;that you first kissed
                        me. Do you remember?&quot;</p>
                    <p>To take her gaze from his face and to avoid seeing her look of loving trust,
                        he put his arms round her. &quot;I don&apos;t deserve you,&quot;
                        he saidone of those empty pretenses of confession that yet give the human
                        soul a sense of truthfulness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d not say that if you knew how happy you make
                        me,&quot; murmured she.</p>
                    <p>The welcome sound of a step in the hall give him his release. When he was in
                        the street, he wiped his hot face with his handkerchief. &quot;And I
                        thought I had no moral sense left! &quot;he reflectednot the first man,
                        in this climax day of the triumph of selfish philosophies, to be astonished
                        by the discovery that the dead hands of heredity and tradition have a power
                        that can successfully defy reason.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-163" n="159"/>
                    <p>He started to walk back home, on impulse took a passing taxi and went to his
                        club. It was the Federal. They said of it that no man who amounted to
                        anything in New York could be elected a member, because any man on his way
                        up could not but offend one or more of the important persons in control.
                        Most of its members were nominated at birth or in childhood and elected as
                        soon as they were twenty-one. Norman was elected after he became a man of
                        consequence. He regarded it as one of the signal triumphs of his career; and
                        beyond question it was proof of his power, of the eagerness of important
                        men, despite their jealousy, to please him and to be in a position to get
                        the benefit of his brains should need arise. Norman&apos;s whole career,
                        like every career great and small, in the arena of action, was a derision of
                        the ancient moralities, a demonstration of the value of fear as an aid to
                        success. Even his friendsand he had as many as he cared to havehad been
                        drawn to him by the desire to placate him, to stand well where there was
                        danger in standing ill.</p>
                    <p>Until dinner time he stood at the club bar, drinking one cocktail after
                        another with that supreme indifference to consequences to health which made
                        his fellow men gape and wonderand cost an occasional imitator health, and
                        perhaps life. Nor did the powerful liquor have the least effect upon him,
                        apparently. Possibly he was in a better humor, but not noticeably so. He
                        dined at the club and spent the evening at bridge, <pb id="VAA2369-164"
                            n="[160]"/> winning several hundred dollars. He enjoyed the
                        consideration he received at that club, for his fellow members being men of
                        both social and financial consequence, their conspicuous respect for him was
                        a concentrated essence of general adulation. He lingered on, eating a great
                        supper with real appetite. He went home in high good humor with himself. He
                        felt that he was a conqueror born, that such things of his desire as did not
                        come could be forced to come. He no longer regarded his passion for the
                        nebulous girl of many personalities as a descent from dignity. Was he not
                        king? Did not his favor give her whatever rank he pleased? Might not a king
                        pick and choose, according to his fancy? Let the smaller fry grow nervous
                        about these matters of caste. They did well to take care lest they should
                        fall. But not he! He had won thus far by haughtiness, never by cringing. His
                        mortal day would be that in which he should abandon his natural tactics for
                        the modes of lesser men. True, only a strong head could remain steady in
                        these giddy altitudes of self-confidence. But was not his head strong?</p>
                    <p>And without hesitation he called up the vision that made him deliriousand
                        detained it and reveled in it until sleep came.</p>

                        that the little Hallowell girl could be so indifferent to him as she seemed.
                        Not that she was a fraudthat is, a conscious fraudeven so much of a fraud as
                        the sincerest of the other women he had known. Simply that she was carrying
                        out a scheme of coquetry. Could it be in human nature, even in the nature of
                        the most indiscriminating of the specimens of young feminine ignorance and
                        folly, not to be flattered by the favor of such a man as he? Common sense
                        answered that it could not bebut neglected to point out to him that almost
                        any vagary might be expected of human nature, when it could produce such a
                        deviation from the recognized types as a man of his position agitated about
                        such an unsought obscurity as Miss Hallowell. He continued to debate the
                        state of her mind as if it were an affair of mightiest momentwhich, indeed,
                        it was to him. And presently his doubt strengthened into conviction. She
                        must be secretly pleased, flattered, responsive. She had been in the office
                        long enough to be impressed by his position. Yes, there must be more or less
                        pretense in her <pb id="VAA2369-166" n="162"/> apparently complete
                        indifferencemore or less pretense, more or less coquetry, probably not a
                        little timidity.</p>
                    <p>She would come down from her high horsewith help and encouragement from him.
                        He was impatient to get to the office and see just how she would do itwhat
                        absurd, amusing attractive child&apos;s trick she would think out,
                        imagining she could fool him, as lesser intelligences are ever fatuously
                        imagining they can outwit greater.</p>
                    <p>He rather thought she would come in to see him on some pretext, would
                        maneuver round like a bird pretending to flutter away from the trap it has
                        every intention of entering. But eleven o&apos;clock of a wasted morning
                        came and she did not appear. He went out to see if she was thereshe must be
                        sick; she could not be there or he would have heard from her.... Yes, she
                        was at her desk, exactly as always. No, not exactly the same. She was
                        obviously attractive now; the air of insignificance had gone, and not the
                        dullest eyes in that office could fail to see at least something of her
                        beauty. And Tetlow was hanging over her, while the girls and boys grinned
                        and whispered. Clearly, the office was &quot;on to&quot; Tetlow....
                        Norman, erect and coldly infuriate, called out:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Tetlowone moment, please.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He went back to his den, Tetlow startling and following like one on the way
                        to the bar for sentence. &quot;Mr. Tetlow,&quot; he said, when they
                        were shut in together, <pb id="VAA2369-167" n="163"/> &quot;you are
                        making a fool of yourself before the whole office.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be a little patient with me, Mr. Norman,&quot; said the head
                        clerk humbly. &quot;I&apos;ve got another place for her.
                        She&apos;s going to take it to-morrow. Thenthere&apos;ll be no more
                        trouble.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman paled. &quot;She wishes to leave?&quot; he contrived to
                        articulate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She spoke to me about leaving before I told her I had found her
                        another job.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman debatedbut for only a moment. &quot;I do not wish her to
                        leave,&quot; he said coldly. &quot;I find her useful and most
                        trustworthy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow&apos;s eyes were fixed strangely upon him.
                        &quot;What&apos;s the matter with you?&quot; asked Norman, the
                        under-note of danger but thinly covered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then she was right,&quot; said Tetlow slowly. &quot;I
                        thought she was mistaken. I see that she is right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; said Normana mere inquiry, devoid of
                        bluster or any other form of nervousness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know very well what I mean, Fred Norman,&quot; said Tetlow.
                        &quot;And you ought to be ashamed of yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t stand there scowling and grimacing like an
                        idiot,&quot; said Norman with an amused smile. &quot;What do you
                        mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She told meabout your coming to see her <pb id="VAA2369-168"
                            n="164"/> about your offer to do something for her fatherabout your
                        acting in a way that made her uneasy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>For an instant Norman was panic-stricken. Then his estimate of her reassured
                        him. &quot;I took your advice,&quot; said he. &quot;I went to
                        see for myself. How did I act that she was made uneasy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She didn&apos;t say. But a woman can tell what a man has in the
                        back of his headwhen it concerns her. And she is a good womanso innocent
                        that you ought to be ashamed of yourself for even thinking of her in that
                        way. God has given innocence instincts, and she felt what you were
                        about.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman laugheda deliberate provocation. &quot;Love has made a fool of
                        you, old man,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I notice you don&apos;t deny,&quot; retorted Tetlow
                        shrewdly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Deny what? There&apos;s nothing to deny.&quot; He felt
                        secure now that he knew she had been reticent with Tetlow as to the
                        happenings in the cottage.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe I&apos;m wronging you,&quot; said Tetlow, but not in
                        the tone of belief. &quot;However that may be, I know you&apos;ll
                        not refuse to listen to my appeal. I love her, Norman. I&apos;m going to
                        make her my wife if I can. And I ask youfor the sake of our old friendshipto
                        let her alone. I&apos;ve no doubt you could dazzle her. You
                        couldn&apos;t make a bad woman of her. But you could make her very
                        miserable.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman pushed about the papers before him. His <pb id="VAA2369-169" n="165"/>
                        face wore a cynical smile; but Tetlow, who knew him in all his moods, saw
                        that he was deeply agitated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know that I can win her, Fred,&quot; he
                        pleaded. &quot;But I feel that I might if I had a fair chance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think she&apos;d refuse <hi rend="i">you</hi>?&quot;
                        said Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Like a flash, unless I&apos;d made her care for me.
                        That&apos;s the kind she is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That sounds absurd. Why, there isn&apos;t a woman in New York
                        who would refuse a chance to take a high jump up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d have said so, too. But since I&apos;ve gotten
                        acquainted with her I&apos;ve learned better. She may be spoiled some
                        day, but she hasn&apos;t been yet. God knows, I wish I could tempt her.
                        But I can&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re entirely too credulous, old man. She&apos;ll
                        make a fool of you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know better,&quot; Tetlow stubbornly maintained.
                        &quot;Anyhow, I don&apos;t care. I love her, and I&apos;d marry
                        her, no matter what her reason for marrying me was.&quot;</p>
                    <p>What pitiful infatuation!worse than his own. Poor Tetlow!he deserved a better
                        fate than to be drawn into this girl&apos;s trapfor, of course, she
                        never could care for such a heavy citizenheavy and homelythe loosely fat
                        kind of homely that is admired by no one, not even by a woman with no eye at
                        all for the physical points of the male. It would be a real kindness to save
                        worthy Tetlow. What a fool she&apos;d make of him!how she&apos;d
                        squander his moneyand torment <pb id="VAA2369-170" n="166"/> him with
                        jealousyand unfit him for his career. Poor Tetlow! If he could get what he
                        wanted, he&apos;d be well punished for his imprudence in wanting it.
                        Really, could friendship do him a greater service than to save him?</p>
                    <p>Norman gave Tetlow a friendly, humorous glance. &quot;You&apos;re a
                        hopeless case, Billy,&quot; he said. &quot;But at least
                        don&apos;t rush into trouble. Take your time. You can always get in, you
                        know; and you may not get in quite so deep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You promise to let her alone?&quot; said Tetlow eagerly.</p>
                    <p>Again his distinguished friend laughed. &quot;Don&apos;t be an ass,
                        old man. Why imagine that, just because you&apos;ve taken a fancy to a
                        girl, everyone wants her?&quot; He clapped him on the shoulder, gave him
                        a push toward the door. &quot;I&apos;ve wasted enough time on this
                        nonsense.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow did not venture to disregard a hint so plain. He went with his doubt
                        still unsolvedhis doubt whether his jealousy was right or his high opinion
                        of his hero friend whose series of ever-mounting successes had filled him
                        with adoration. He knew the way of success, knew no man could tread it
                        unless he had, or acquired, a certain hardness of heart that made him an
                        uncomfortable not to say dangerous associate. He regretted his own inability
                        to acquire that indispensable hardness, and envied and admired it in Fred
                        Norman. But, at <pb id="VAA2369-171" n="167"/> the same time that he
                        admired, he could not help distrusting.</p>
                    <p>Norman battled with his insanity an hour, then sent for Miss Hallowell.</p>
                    <p>The girl had lost her look of strength and vitality. She seemed frail and
                        dimso unimportant physically that he wondered why her charm for him
                        persisted. Yet it did persist. If he could take her in his arms, could make
                        her drooping beauty revive!through love for him if possible; if not, then
                        through anger and hate! He must make her feel, must make her acknowledge,
                        that he had power. It seemed to him another instance of the resistless
                        fascination which the unattainable, however unworthy, has ever had for the
                        conqueror temperament.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are leaving?&quot; he said curtly, both a question and an
                        affirmation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are making a mistakea serious mistake.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She stood before him listlessly, as if she had no interest either in what he
                        was saying or in him. That maddening indifference!</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was a mistake to tattle your trouble to Tetlow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did not tattle,&quot; said she quietly, colorlessly.
                        &quot;I said only enough to make him help me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what did he say about me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That I had misjudged youthat I must be mistaken.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-172" n="168"/>
                    <p>Norman laughed. &quot;How seriously the little people of the world do
                        take themselves!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him. His amused eyes met hers frankly. &quot;You
                        didn&apos;t mean it?&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>He beamed on her. &quot;Certainly I did. But I&apos;m not a lunatic
                        or a wild beast. Do you think I would take advantage of a girl in your
                        position?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her eyes seemed to grow large and weary, and an expression of experience
                        stole over her young face, giving it a strange appearance of age-in-youth.
                        &quot;It has been done,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>How reconcile such a look with the theory of her childlike innocence? But
                        then how reconcile any two of the many varied personalities he had seen in
                        her? He said: &quot;Yesit has been done. But not by me. I shall take
                        from you only what you gladly give.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will get nothing else,&quot; said she with quiet strength.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That being settled&quot; he went on, holding up a small package
                        of papers bound together by an elastic&quot;Here are the proposed
                        articles of incorporation of the Chemical Research Company. How do you like
                        the name?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The company that is to back your father. Capital stock, twenty-five
                        thousand dollars, one half paid up. Your father to be employed as director
                        of the laboratories at five thousand a year, with a fund of <pb
                            id="VAA2369-173" n="169"/> ten thousand to draw upon. You to be employed
                        as secretary and treasurer at fifteen hundred a year. I will take the
                        paid-up stock, and your father and you will have the privilege of buying it
                        back at par within five years. Do you follow me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I understand,&quot; was her unexpected reply. Her
                        replies were usually unexpected, like the expressions of her face and
                        figure; she was continually comprehending where one would have said she
                        would not, and not comprehending where it seemed absurd that she should not.
                        &quot;Yes, I understand.... What else?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked intently at him, and her eyes seemed to be reading his soul to the
                        bottom.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing else,&quot; he repeated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No obligationfor moneyorfor anything?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No obligation. A hope perhaps.&quot; He was smiling with the
                        gayest good humor. &quot;But not the kind of hope that ever becomes a
                        disagreeable demand for payment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She seated herself, her hands in her lap, her eyes downa lovely picture of
                        pensive repose. He waited patiently, feasting his senses upon her delicate,
                        aromatic loveliness. At last she said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I accept.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He had anticipated an argument. This promptness took him by surprise. He felt
                        called upon to explain, to excuse her acceptance. &quot;I am taking a
                        little flyer <pb id="VAA2369-174" n="170"/> making a gamble,&quot; said
                        he. &quot;Your father may turn up nothing of commercial value. Again the
                        company may pay big&quot;</p>
                    <p>She gave him a long look through half-closed eyes, a queer smile flitting
                        round her lips. &quot;I understand perfectly why you are doing
                        it,&quot; she said. &quot;Do <hi rend="i">you</hi> understand why I
                        am accepting?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why should you refuse?&quot; rejoined he. &quot;It is a
                        good business prop&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know very well why I should refuse. But&quot; She gave a
                        quiet laugh of experience; it made him feel that she was making a fool of
                        him&quot;I shall not refuse. I am able to take care of myself. And I
                        want father to have his chance. Of course, I shan&apos;t explain to
                        him.&quot; She gave him a mischievous glance. &quot;And I
                        don&apos;t think <hi rend="i">you</hi> will.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He contrived to cover his anger, doubt, chagrin, general feeling of having
                        been outwitted. &quot;No, I shan&apos;t tell him,&quot; laughed
                        he. &quot;You are making a great fool of me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you want to back out?&quot;</p>
                    <p>What audacity! He hesitateddid not dare. Her indifference to himher personal,
                        her physical indifference gave her the mastery. His teeth clenched and his
                        passion blazed in his eyes as he said: &quot;Noyou witch! I&apos;ll
                        see it through.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She smiled lightly. &quot;I suppose you&apos;ll come to the offices
                        of the companyoccasionally?&quot; She drew <pb id="VAA2369-175" n="171"
                        /> nearer, stood at the corner of the desk. Into her exquisite eyes came a
                        look of tenderness. &quot;And I shall be glad to see you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean that?&quot; he said, despising himself for his humble
                        eagerness, and hating her even as he loved her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed I do.&quot; She smiled bewitchingly. &quot;You are a
                        lot better man than you think.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am an awful fool about you,&quot; retorted he. &quot;You
                        see, I play my game with all my cards on the table. I wish I could say the
                        same of you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not playing a game,&quot; replied she. &quot;You make
                        a mystery where there isn&apos;t any. Andall your cards aren&apos;t
                        on the table.&quot; She laughed mockingly. &quot;At least, you think
                        there&apos;s one that isn&apos;tthough, really, it is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;About your engagement.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He covered superbly. &quot;Oh,&quot; said he in the most indifferent
                        tone. &quot;Tetlow told you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;As soon as I heard that,&quot; she went on, &quot;I felt
                        better about you. I understand how it is with men the passing fancies they
                        have for women.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How did you learn?&quot; demanded he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think a girl could spend several years knocking about down
                        town in New York without getting experience?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He smileda forced smile of raillery, hiding sudden <pb id="VAA2369-176"
                            n="172"/> fierce suspicion and jealousy. &quot;I should say not. But
                        you always pretend innocence.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t be held responsible for what you read into my
                        looks and into what I say,&quot; observed she with her air of a wise old
                        infant. &quot;But I was so glad to find out that you were seriously in
                        love with a nice girl up town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He burst out laughing. She gazed at him in childlike surprise. &quot;Why
                        are you laughing at me?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothingnothing,&quot; he assured her. He would have found it
                        difficult to explain why he was so intensely amused at hearing the grand
                        Josephine Burroughs called &quot;a nice girl up town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are in love with her? You are engaged to her?&quot; she
                        inquired, her grave eyes upon him with an irresistible appeal for truth in
                        them.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tetlow didn&apos;t lie to you,&quot; evaded he.
                        &quot;You don&apos;t know it, but Tetlow is going to ask you to
                        marry him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I knew,&quot; replied she indifferently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How? Did he tell you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. Just as I knew you were not going to ask me to marry
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The mere phrase, even when stated as a negation, gave him a sensation of ice
                        suddenly laid against the heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s quite easy to tell the difference between the two
                        kinds of menthose that care for me more than <pb id="VAA2369-177" n="173"/>
                        they care for themselves and those that care for themselves more than they
                        care for me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the way it looks to youis it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the way it is,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There are some things you don&apos;t understand. This is one of
                        them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe I don&apos;t,&quot; said she. &quot;But
                        I&apos;ve my own ideaand I&apos;m going to stick to it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This amused him. &quot;You are a very opinionated and self-confident
                        young lady,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>She laughed roguishly. &quot;I&apos;m taking up a lot of your
                        time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t think of it. You haven&apos;t asked when the new
                        deal is to begin.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yesand I shall have to tell Mr. Tetlow I&apos;m not taking
                        the place he got for me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be careful what you say to him,&quot; cautioned Norman.
                        &quot;You must see it wouldn&apos;t be well to tell him what you are
                        going to do. There&apos;s no reason on earth why he should know your
                        businessis there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not reply; she was reflecting.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are not thinking of marrying Tetloware you?</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&apos;t love himand
                        couldn&apos;t learn to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With a sincerely judicial air, now that he felt secure, he said:
                        &quot;Why not? It would be a good match.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t love him,&quot; she repeated, as if that were
                        a <pb id="VAA2369-178" n="174"/> sufficient and complete answer. And he was
                        astonished to find that he so regarded it, also, in spite of every assault
                        of all that his training had taught him to regard as common sense about
                        human nature.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can simply say to Tetlow that you&apos;ve decided to stay
                        at home and take care of your father. The offices of the company will be at
                        your house. Your official duties practically amount to taking care of your
                        father. So you&apos;ll be speaking the truth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, it isn&apos;t exactly lying, to keep something from
                        somebody who has no right to know it. What you suggest isn&apos;t quite
                        the truth. But it&apos;s near enough, and I&apos;ll say it to
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His own view of lying was the same as that she had expressed. Also, he had no
                        squeamishness about saying what was in no sense true, if the falsehood were
                        necessary to his purposes. Yet her statement of her code, moral though he
                        thought it and eminently sensible as well, lowered her once more in his
                        estimation. He was eager to find reason or plausible excuse for believing
                        her morally other and less than she seemed to be. Immediately the prospects
                        of his ultimate projectswhatever they might prove to betook on a more
                        hopeful air. &quot;And I&apos;d advise you to have Tetlow keep away
                        from you. We don&apos;t want him nosing round.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, indeed,&quot; said she. &quot;He is a nice man, but
                        tiresome. And if I encouraged him ever so little, he&apos;d be
                        sentimental. The most tiresome thing in the world <pb id="VAA2369-179"
                            n="175"/> to a girl is a man who talks that sort of thing when she
                        doesn&apos;t want to hear itfrom him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He laughed. &quot;Meaning me?&quot; he suggested.</p>
                    <p>She nodded, much pleased. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry about that,&quot; mocked he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shan&apos;t till I have to,&quot; she assured him.
                        &quot;And I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll have to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>On the Monday morning following, Tetlow came in to see Norman as soon as he
                        arrived. &quot;I want a two weeks&apos; leave,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;I&apos;m going to Bermuda or down there somewhere.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, what&apos;s the matter?&quot; cried Norman.
                        &quot;You do look ill, old man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw her last night,&quot; replied the chief clerk, dropping
                        an effort at concealing his dejection. &quot;She she turned me
                        down.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Really? You?&quot; Norman&apos;s tone of sympathetic
                        surprise would not have deceived half attentive ears. But Tetlow was
                        securely absorbed. &quot;Why, Billy, she can&apos;t hope to make as
                        good a match.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s what I told herwhen I saw the game was going
                        against me. But it was no use.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman trifled nervously with the papers before him. Presently he said,
                        &quot;Is it some one else?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow shook his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you know?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because she said so,&quot; replied the head clerk.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-180" n="176"/>
                    <p>&quot;Ohif she said so, that settles it,&quot; said Norman with
                        raillery.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s given up workthank God,&quot; pursued
                        Tetlow.&quot; She&apos;s getting more beautiful all the timeNorman,
                        if you had seen her last night, you&apos;d understand why I&apos;m
                        stark mad about her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman&apos;s eyes were down. His hands, the muscles of his jaw were
                        clinched.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, I mustn&apos;t think of that,&quot; Tetlow went on.
                        &quot;As I was about to say, if she were to stay on in the offices some
                        onesome attractive man like you, only with the heart of a
                        scoundrel&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman laughed cynically.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, a scoundrel!&quot; reiterated the fat head-clerk.
                        &quot;Some scoundrel would tempt her beyond her power to resist. Money
                        and clothes and luxury will do anything. We all get to be harlots here in
                        New York. Some of us know it, and some don&apos;t. But we all look it
                        and act it. And she&apos;d go the way of the restwith or without
                        marriage. It&apos;s just as well she didn&apos;t marry me. I know
                        what&apos;d have become of her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman nodded.</p>
                    <p>Tetlow gave a weary sigh. &quot;Anyhow, she&apos;s safe at home with
                        her father. He&apos;s found a backer for his experiments.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s good,&quot; said Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can spare me for ten days,&quot; Tetlow went on.
                        &quot;I&apos;d be of no use if I stayed.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-181" n="177"/>
                    <p>There was a depth of misery in his kind gray eyes that moved Norman to get up
                        and lay a friendly hand on his shoulder. &quot;It&apos;s the best
                        thing, old man. She wasn&apos;t for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow dropped into a chair and sobbed. &quot;It has killed me,&quot;
                        he groaned. &quot;I don&apos;t mean I&apos;ll commit suicide or
                        die. I mean I&apos;m dead insidedead.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, come, Billywhere&apos;s your good sense?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know what I&apos;m talking about,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;Norman, God help the man who meets the woman he really wantsGod
                        help him if she doesn&apos;t want him. You don&apos;t understand.
                        You&apos;ll never have the experience. Any woman you wanted would be
                        sure to want you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman, his hand still on Tetlow&apos;s shoulder, was staring ahead with
                        a terrible expression upon his strong features.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If she could see the inside of methe part that&apos;s the real
                        meI think she would love meor learn to love me. But she can only see the
                        outsidethis homely face and body of mine. It&apos;s horrible, Fredto
                        have a mind and a heart fit for love and for being loved, and an outside
                        that repels it. And how many of us poor devils of that sort there aremen and
                        women both!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman was at the window now, his back to the room, to his friend. After a
                        while Tetlow rose and made a feeble effort to straighten himself.
                        &quot;Is it all right about the vacation?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-182" n="[178]"/>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Norman, without turning.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you, Fred. You&apos;re a good friend.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll see you before you go,&quot; said Norman, still
                        facing the window. &quot;You&apos;ll come back all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow did not answer. When Norman turned he was alone.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> no way was Norman&apos;s luck superior to most
                        men&apos;s more splendidly than in that his inborn tendency to arrogant
                        and extravagant desires was matched by an inborn capacity to get the
                        necessary money. His luxurious tastes were certainly not moderated by his
                        associations enormously rich people who, while they could be stingy enough
                        some respects, at the same time could and did fling away fortunes in
                        gratifying selfish whimsfor silly showy houses, for retinues of wasteful
                        servants, for gewgaws that accentuated the homeliness of their homely women
                        and coarsened and vulgarized their pretty women or perhaps for a
                        night&apos;s gambling or entertaining, or for the forced smiles and
                        contemptuous caresses of some belle of the other world. Norman fortunately
                        cared not at all for the hugely expensive pomp of the life of the rich; if
                        he had, he would have hopelessly involved himself, as after all he was not a
                        money-grubber but a lawyer. But when there appeared anything for which he
                        did care, he was ready to bid for it like the richest of the rich.</p>
                    <p>Therefore the investment of a few thousand dollars seemed a small matter to
                        him. He had many a time <pb id="VAA2369-184" n="180"/> tossed away far more
                        for far less. He did not dole out the sum he had agreed to provide. He paid
                        it into the Jersey City bank to the credit of the Chemical Research Company
                        and informed its secretary and treasurer that she could draw freely against
                        it. &quot;If you will read the by-laws of the company,&quot; said
                        he, &quot;you will see that you&apos;ve the right to spend exactly
                        as you see fit. When the money runs low, let me know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll be very careful,&quot; said Dorothea Hallowell,
                        secretary and treasurer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s precisely what we don&apos;t want,&quot;
                        replied he. He glanced round the tiny parlor of the cottage. &quot;We
                        want everything to be run in first-class shape. That&apos;s the only way
                        to get results. First of all, you must take a proper housea good-sized one,
                        with large groundsroom for building your father a proper
                        laboratory.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her dazed and dazzled expression delighted him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you must live better. You must keep at least two
                        servants.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But we can&apos;t afford it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your father has five thousand a year. You have fifteen hundred.
                        That makes sixty-five hundred. The rent of the house and the wages and keep
                        of the servants are a charge against the corporation. So, you can well
                        afford to make yourselves comfortable.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t got used to the idea as yet,&quot; said
                        Dorothea. &quot;Yeswe <hi rend="i">are</hi> better off than we
                        were.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-185" n="181"/>
                    <p>&quot;And you must live better. I want you to get some clothesand things
                        of that sort.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shrank within herself and sat quiet, her gaze fixed upon her hands lying
                        limp in her lap.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is no reason why your father shouldn&apos;t be made
                        absolutely comfortable and happy. That&apos;s the way to get the best
                        results from a man of his sort.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She faded on toward the self-effacing blank he had first known.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Think it out, Dorothy,&quot; he said in his frankest, kindliest
                        way. &quot;You&apos;ll see I&apos;m right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No? What does that mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve an instinct against it,&quot; replied she.
                        &quot;I&apos;d rather father and I kept on as we are.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But that&apos;s impossible. You&apos;ve no right to live in
                        this small, cramping way. You must broaden out and give <hi rend="i"
                        >him</hi> room to grow.... Isn&apos;t that sensible?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It sounds so,&quot; she admitted. &quot;But&quot; She
                        gazed round helplessly &quot;I&apos;m afraid!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Afraid of what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then don&apos;t bother about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll have to be verycareful,&quot; she said
                        thoughtfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;As you please,&quot; replied he. &quot;Only, don&apos;t
                        live and think on a ten-dollar-a-week basis. That isn&apos;t the way to
                        get on.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-186" n="182"/>
                    <p>He never again brought up the matter in direct form. But most of his
                        conversation was indirect and more or less subtle suggestions as to ways of
                        branching out. She moved cautiously for a few days, then timidly began to
                        spend money.</p>
                    <p>There is a notion widely spread abroad that people who have little money know
                        more about the art of spending money and the science of economizing than
                        those who have much. It would be about as sensible to say that the best
                        swimmers are those who have never been near the water, or no nearer than a
                        bath tub. Anyone wishing to be convinced need only make an excursion into
                        the poor tenement district and observe the garbage barrels overflowing with
                        spoiled foodor the trashy goods exposed for sale in the shops and the
                        markets. Those who have had money and have lost it are probably, as a rule,
                        the wisest in thrift. Those who have never had money are almost invariably
                        prodigalbecause they are ignorant. When Dorothea Hallowell was a baby the
                        family had had money. But never since she could remember had they been
                        anything but poor.</p>
                    <p>She did not know how to spend money. She did not know prices or valuesbeing
                        in that respect precisely like the mass of mankindand womankindwho imagine
                        they are economical because they hunt so-called bargains and haggle with
                        merchants who have got doubly ready for them by laying in inferior goods and
                        by putting up prices in advance. She knew how much <pb id="VAA2369-187"
                            n="183"/> ten dollars a week was, the meaning of the twenty to thirty
                        dollars a week her father had made. But she had only a faintand
                        exaggeratedly mistakennotion about sixty-five hundred a yearsix and a half
                        thousands. It seemed wealth to her, so vast that a hundred thousand a year
                        would have seemed no more. As soon as she drifted away from the known
                        coursethe thirty to forty dollars a week upon which they had been
                        livingDorothea Hallowell was in a trackless sea, with a broken compass and
                        no chart whatever. A common enough experience in America, the land of sudden
                        changes of fortune, of rosiest hopes about &quot;striking it
                        rich,&quot; of carelessness and ignorance as to values, of eager and
                        untrained appetite for luxury and novelty of any and every kind.</p>
                    <p>At first any expenditure, however small, for the plainest comfort which had
                        been beyond their means seemed a giddy extravagance. But a bank account<hi
                            rend="i">and</hi> a check booksoon dissipated that nervousness. A few
                        charge accounts, a little practice in the simple easy gesture of drawing a
                        check, and she was almost at her ease. With people who have known only
                        squalor or with those who have earned their better fortune by privation and
                        slow accumulation, the spreading out process is usually slownot so slow as
                        it used to be when our merchants had not learned the art of tempting any and
                        every kind of human nature, but still far from rapid. A piece of money
                        reminds them vividly and <pb id="VAA2369-188" n="184"/> painfully of the
                        toil put into acquiring it; and they shy away from the pitfall of the facile
                        check. With those born and bred as Dorothy was and elevated into what seems
                        to them affluence by no effort of their own, the spreading is a tropical,
                        overnight affair.</p>
                    <p>Counting all she spent and arranged to spend in those first few weeks, you
                        had no great total. But it was great for a girl who had been making ten
                        dollars a week. Also there were sown in her mind broadcast and thick the
                        seeds of desire for more luxurious comfort, of need for it, that could never
                        be uprooted.</p>
                    <p>Norman came over almost every evening. He got a new and youthful and
                        youth-restoring kind of pleasure out of this process of expansion. He liked
                        to hear each trifling detail, and he was always making suggestions that bore
                        immediate fruit in further expenditure. When he again brought up the subject
                        of a larger house, she listened with only the faintest protests. Her ideas
                        of such a short time before seemed small, laughably small now.
                        &quot;Father was worrying only this morning because he is so
                        cramped,&quot; she admitted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We must remedy that at once,&quot; said Norman.</p>
                    <p>And on the following Sunday he and she went house hunting. They found a
                        satisfactory placepeculiarly satisfactory to Norman because it was near the
                        Hudson tunnel, and so only a few minutes from his office. To Dorothy it
                        loomed a mansion, almost a palace. In fact it was a modestly roomy
                        old-fashioned brick house, with <pb id="VAA2369-189" n="185"/> a brick
                        stable at the side that, with a little changing, would make an admirable
                        laboratory.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You haven&apos;t the timeor the experienceto fit this place
                        up,&quot; said Norman. &quot;I&apos;ll attend to itthat if,
                        I&apos;ll have it attended to.&quot; Seeing her uneasy expression,
                        he added: &quot;I can get much better terms. They&apos;d certainly
                        overcharge you. There&apos;s no sense in wasting moneyis
                        there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she admitted, convinced.</p>
                    <p>He gave the order to a firm of decorators. It was a moderate order,
                        considering the amount of work that had to be done. But if the girl had seen
                        the estimates Norman indorsed, she would have been terrified. However, he
                        saw to it that she did not see them; and she, ignorant of values, believed
                        him when he told her the general account of the corporation must be charged
                        with two thousand dollars.</p>
                    <p>Her alarm took him by surprise. The sum seemed small to himand it was only
                        about one fifth what the alterations and improvements had cost. Cried she,
                        &quot;Why, that&apos;s more than our whole income for a year has
                        been!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are forgetting these improvements add to the value of the
                        property. I&apos;ve bought it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>That quieted her. &quot;You are sure you didn&apos;t pay those
                        decorators and furnishers too much?&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t like their work?&quot; inquired he,
                        chagrined.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-190" n="186"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yesyes, indeed,&quot; she assured him. &quot;I like
                        plain, solid-looking things. Buttwo thousand dollars is a lot of
                        money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman regretted that, as his whole object had been to please her, he had not
                        ordered the more showy cheaper stuff but had insisted upon the simplest,
                        plainest-looking appointments throughout. Even her bedroom, furniture, even
                        her dressing table set, was of the kind that suggests cost only to the
                        experienced, carefully and well educated in values and in taste.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I&apos;m sure it isn&apos;t fair to charge <hi rend="i"
                            >all</hi> these things to the company,&quot; she protested.
                        &quot;I can&apos;t allow it. Not the things for my personal
                        use.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You <hi rend="i">are</hi> a fierce watchdog of a
                        treasurer,&quot; said Norman, laughing at her but noting and respecting
                        the fine instinct of good breeding shown in her absence of greediness, of
                        desire to get all she could. &quot;But I&apos;m letting the firm of
                        decorators take over what you leave behind in the old house. I&apos;ll
                        see what they&apos;ll allow for it. Maybe that will cover the expense
                        you object to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This contented her. Nor was she in the least suspicious when he announced
                        that the decorators had made such a liberal allowance that the deficit was
                        but three hundred dollars. &quot;Those chaps,&quot; he explained,
                        &quot;have a wide margin of profit. Besides, they&apos;re eager to
                        get more and bigger work from me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A few weeks, and he was enjoying the sight of her ensconced with her father
                        in luxurious comfortwith <pb id="VAA2369-191" n="187"/> two servants, with a
                        well-run house, with pleasant gardens, with all that is at the command of an
                        income of six thousand a year in a comparatively inexpensive city.</p>
                    <p>Only occasionallyand then not deeplywas he troubled by the reflection that he
                        was still far from his goaland had made apparently absurdly little progress
                        toward it through all this maneuvering. The truth was, he preferred to
                        linger when lingering gave him so many new kinds of pleasure. Of those in
                        the large and motley company that sit down to the banquet of the senses, the
                        most are crude, if not coarse, gluttons. They eat fast and furiously, having
                        a raw appetite. Now and then there is one who has some idea of the art of
                        enjoymentthe art of prolonging and varying both the joys of anticipation and
                        the joys of realization.</p>
                    <p>He turned his attention to tempting her to extravagance in dress. But his
                        success there was not all he could have wished. She wore better clothesmuch
                        better. She no longer looked the poor working girl, struggling desperately
                        to be neat and clean. She had almost immediately taken on the air of the
                        comfortable classes. But everything she got for herself was inexpensive. And
                        she made dresses for herself, and trimmed all her hats. With the hats Norman
                        found no fault. There her good taste produced about as satisfactory results
                        as could have been got at the fashionable millinersmore satisfactory than
                        are got by the women who go there, with no taste of their own beyond a hazy
                        idea that they <pb id="VAA2369-192" n="188"/> want &quot;something like
                        what Mrs. So-and-So is wearing.&quot; But homemade dresses were a
                        different matter.</p>
                    <p>Norman longed to have her in toilettes that would bring out the full beauty
                        of her marvelous figure. He, after the manner of the more intelligent and
                        worldlywise New York men, had some knowledge of women&apos;s clothes.
                        His sister knew how to dress; Josephine knew how, though her taste was
                        somewhat too sober to suit Normanat least to suit him in Dorothy. He thought
                        out and suggested dresses to Dorothy, and told her where to get them.
                        Dorothy tried to carry out at home such of his suggestions as pleased
                        herfor, like all women, she believed she knew how to dress herself. Her
                        handiwork was creditable. It would have contented a less exacting and less
                        trained taste than Norman&apos;s. It would have contented him had he not
                        been infatuated with her beauty of face and form. As it was, the improvement
                        in her appearance only served to intensify his agitation. He now saw in her
                        not only all that had first conquered him, but also those unsuspected
                        beauties and gracesand possibilities of beauty and grace yet more
                        entrancing, were she but dressed properly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t begin to appreciate how beautiful you
                        are,&quot; said he. It had ever been one of his rules in dealing with
                        women to feed their physical vanity sparingly and cautiously, lest it should
                        blaze up into one of those consuming flames that produce a very frenzy of
                            <pb id="VAA2369-193" n="189"/> conceit. But this rule, like all the
                        others, had gone by the board. He could not conceal his infatuation from
                        her, not even when he saw that it was turning her head and making his task
                        harder and harder. &quot;If you would only go over to New York to
                        several dressmakers whose names I&apos;ll give you, I know
                        you&apos;d get clothes from them that you could touch up into something
                        uncommon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t afford it,&quot; said she. &quot;What I
                        have is good enoughand costs more than I&apos;ve the right to
                        pay.&quot; And her tone silenced him; it was the tone of finality, and
                        he had discovered that she had a will.</p>
                    <p>Never before had Frederick Norman let any important thing drift. And when he
                        started in with Dorothy he had no idea of changing that fixed policy. He
                        would have scoffed if anyone had foretold to him that he would permit the
                        days and the weeks to go by with nothing definite accomplished toward any
                        definite purpose. Yet that was what occurred. Every time he came he had in
                        mind a fixed resolve to make distinct progress with the girl. Every time he
                        left he had a furious quarrel with himself for his weakness. &quot;She
                        is making a fool of me,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;She <hi
                            rend="i">must</hi> be laughing at me.&quot; But he returned only to
                        repeat his folly, to add one more to the lengthening, mocking series of lost
                        opportunities.</p>
                    <p>The truth lay deeper than be saw. He recognized <pb id="VAA2369-194" n="190"
                        /> only his own weakness of the infatuated lover&apos;s fatuous
                        timidity. He did not realize how potent her charm for him was, how
                        completely content she made him when he was with her, just from the fact
                        that they were together. After a time an unsatisfied passion often thus
                        diffuses itself, ceases to be a narrow torrent, becomes a broad river whose
                        resistless force is hidden beneath an appearance of sparkling calm. Her
                        ingenuousness amused him; her developing taste and imagination interested
                        him; her freshness, her freedom from any sense of his importance in the
                        world fascinated him, and there was a keener pleasure than he dreamed in the
                        novel sensation of breathing the perfume of what he, the one time cynic,
                        would have staked his life on being unsullied purity. Their relations were
                        to him a delightful variation upon the intimacy of master and pupil. Either
                        he was listening to her or was answering her questionsand the time flew. And
                        there never was a moment when he could have introduced the subject that most
                        concerned him when he was not with her. To have introduced it would have
                        been rudely to break the charm of a happy afternoon or evening.</p>
                    <p>Was she leading him on and on nowhere deliberately? Or was it the sweet and
                        innocent simplicity it seemed? He could not tell. He Would have broken the
                        charm and put the matter to the test had he not been afraid of the
                        consequences. What had he to fear? Was she not in his power? Was she not
                        his, whenever he should <pb id="VAA2369-195" n="191"/> stretch forth his
                        hand and claim her? Yesno doubtnot the slightest doubt. But He was afraid to
                        break the charm; it was such a satisfying charm.</p>
                    <p>Thenthere was her father.</p>
                    <p>Men who arrive anywhere in any direction always have the habit of ignoring
                        the nonessential more or less strongly developed. One reason perhaps the
                        chief reasonwhy Norman had got up to the high places of material success at
                        so early an age was that he had an unerring instinct for the essential and
                        wasted no time or energy upon the nonessential. In his present situation
                        Dorothy&apos;s father, the abstracted man of science, was one of the
                        factors that obviously fell into the nonessential class. Norman knew little
                        about him, and cared less. Also, he took care to avoid knowing him. Knowing
                        the father would open up possibilities of discomfort But, being a wise young
                        man, Norman gave this matter the least possible thought.</p>
                    <p>Still, it was necessary that the two men see something of each other.
                        Hallowell discovered nothing about Norman, not enough about his personal
                        appearance to have recognized him in the street far enough away from the
                        laboratory to dissociate the two ideas. Human beingsexcept his daughterdid
                        not interest Hallowell; and his feeling for her was somewhat in the nature
                        of an abstraction. Norman, on the other hand, was intensely interested in
                        human beings; indeed, he was interested in little else. He was always
                        thrusting <pb id="VAA2369-196" n="192"/> through surfaces, probing into
                        minds and souls. He sought thoroughly to understand the living machines he
                        used in furthering his ambitions and desires. So it was not long before he
                        learned much about old Newton Hallowelland began to admire himand with a man
                        of Norman&apos;s temperament to admire is to like.</p>
                    <p>He had assumed at the outset that the scientist was more or less the crank.
                        He had not talked with him many times before he discovered that, far from
                        being in any respect a crank, he was a most able and well-balanced
                        mentalitya genius. The day came when, Dorothy not having returned from a
                        shopping tour, he lingered in the laboratory talking with the father, or,
                        rather, listening while the man of great ideas unfolded to him conceptions
                        of the world that set his imagination to soaring.</p>
                    <p>Most of us see but dimly beyond the ends of our noses, and visualize what
                        lies within our range of sight most imperfectly. We know little about
                        ourselves, less about others. We fancy that the world and the human race
                        always have been about as they now are, and always will be. History reads to
                        us like a fairy tale, to which we give conventional acceptance as truth. As
                        to the future, we can conceive nothing but the continuation of just what we
                        see about us in the present. Norman, practical man though he was, living in
                        and for the present, had yet an imagination. He thought Hallowell a kind of
                        fool for thinking only of the future and <pb id="VAA2369-197" n="193"/>
                        working only for itbut he soon came to think him a divine fool. And through
                        Hallowell&apos;s spectacles he was charmed for many an hour with visions
                        of the world that is to be when, in the slow but steady processes of
                        evolution, the human race will become intelligent, will conquer the universe
                        with the weapons of science and will make it over.</p>
                    <p>When he first stated his projects to Norman, the young man had difficulty in
                        restraining his amusement. A new idea, in any line of thought with which we
                        are not familiar, always strikes us as ridiculous. Norman had been educated
                        in the ignorant conventional way still in high repute among the vulgar and
                        among those whose chief delight is to make the vulgar gape in awe. He
                        therefore had no science, that is, no knowledgeoutside his professionbut
                        only what is called learning, though tommyrot would be a fitter name for it.
                        He had only the most meager acquaintance with that great fundamental of a
                        sound and sane education, embryology. He knew nothing of what science had
                        already done to destroy all the still current notions about the mystery of
                        life and birth. He still laughed, as at a clever bit of legerdemain, when
                        Hallowell showed him how far science had progressed toward mastery of the
                        life of the lower forms of existencehow those &quot;worms&quot;
                        could be artificially created, could be aged, made young again, made
                        diseased and decrepit, restored to perfect health, could be swung back and
                        forth or sideways or sinuously <pb id="VAA2369-198" n="194"/> along the span
                        of existencecould even be killed and brought back to vigor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ve been at this sort of thing only a few
                        years,&quot; said Hallowell. &quot;I rather think it will not be
                        many years now before we shall not even need the initial germ of life to
                        enable us to create but can do it by pure chemical means, just as a taper is
                        lighted by holding a match to it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman ceased to think of sleight-of-hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Life,&quot; continued the juggler, transformed now into
                        practical man, leader of men, &quot;life has been demonstrated to be
                        simply one of the forms of energy, or one of the consequences of energy. The
                        final discovery is scientifically not far away. Then&quot; His eyes
                        lighted up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then what?&quot; asked Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then immortalityin the body. Eternal youth and health. A body that
                        is renewable much as any of our inanimate machines of the factory is
                        renewable. Why not? So far as we know, no living thing ever dies except by
                        violence. Diseaseold agethey are quite as much violence as the knife and the
                        bullet. What science can now do with these &apos;worms,&apos; as my
                        daughter calls themthat it will be able to do with the higher
                        organisms.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And the world would soon be jammed to the last acre,&quot;
                        objected Norman.</p>
                    <p>Hallowell shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Not at all.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-199" n="195"/>
                    <p>There will be no necessity to create new people, except to take the place of
                        those who may be accidentally obliterated.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But the world is dyingthe earth, itself, I mean.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;True. But science may learn how to arrest that cooling processor to
                        adapt man to it. Or, it may be that when the world ceases to be inhabitable
                        we shall have learned how to cross the star spaces, as I think I&apos;ve
                        suggested before. Thenwe should simply find a planet in its youth somewhere,
                        and migrate to it, as a man now moves to a new house when the old ceases to
                        please him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is a long flight of the fancy,&quot; said Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Longbut no stronger than the telegraph or the telephone. The
                        trouble with us is that we have been long stupefied by the ignorant
                        theological ideas of the universeideas that have come down to us from the
                        childhood of the race. We haven&apos;t got used to the new erathe
                        scientific era. And that is natural. Why, until less than three generations
                        ago there was really no such thing as science.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hadn&apos;t thought of that,&quot; admitted Norman.
                        &quot;We certainly have got on very fast in those three
                        generations.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rather fast. Not so fast, however, as we shall in the next three.

                        ago men lived much as they had for thousands of years. But it&apos;s
                        very different to-day. It will be inconceivably different
                        tomorrow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman could not get these ideas out of his brain. He began to understand why
                        Hallowell cared nothing about the active life of the dayabout its religion,
                        politics, modes of labor, its habits of one creature preying upon another.
                        To-morrow, not religion, not politics, but chemistry, not priests nor
                        politicians, but chemists, would change all thatand change it by the only
                        methods that compel. An abstract idea of liberty or justice can be rejected,
                        evaded, nullified. But a telephone, a steam engine, a mode of prolonging
                        lifethose realizations of ideas <hi rend="i">compel.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>When Dorothy came, Norman went into the garden with her in a frame of mind so
                        different from any he had ever before experienced that he scarcely
                        recognized himself. As the influence of the father&apos;s glowing
                        imagination of genius waned before the daughter&apos;s physical
                        loveliness and enchantment for him, he said to himself,
                        &quot;I&apos;ll keep away from him.&quot; Why? He did not permit
                        himself to go on to examine into his reasons. But he could not conceal them
                        from himself quickly enough to hide the knowledge that they were moral.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is the matter with you to-day?&quot; said Dorothy.
                        &quot;You are not a bit interesting.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Interested, you mean,&quot; he said with a smile of <pb
                            id="VAA2369-201" n="197"/> raillery, for he had long since discovered
                        that she was not without the feminine vanity that commands the centering of
                        all interest in the woman herself and resents any wandering of thought as a
                        slur upon her own powers of fascination.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, interested then,&quot; said she. &quot;You are
                        thinking about something else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not now,&quot; he assured her.</p>
                    <p>But he left early. No sooner had he got away from the house than the
                        scientific dreaming vanished and he wished himself back with her againback
                        where every glance at her gave him the most exquisite sensations. And when
                        he came the following day he apparently had once more restored her father to
                        his proper place of a nonessential. All that definitely remained of the day
                        before&apos;s impression was a certain satisfaction that he was aiding
                        with his money an enterprise of greater value and of less questionable
                        character than merely his own project. But the powerful influences upon our
                        life and conduct are rarely direct and definite. He, quite unconsciously,
                        had a wholly different feeling about Dorothy because of her father, because
                        of what his new knowledge of and respect for her father had revealed and
                        would continue to reveal to him as to the girl herselfher training, her
                        inheritance, her character that could not but be touched with the splendor
                        of the father&apos;s noble genius. And long afterward, when the father
                        as a distinct personality had been almost forgotten, Norman <pb
                            id="VAA2369-202" n="198"/> was still, altogether unconsciously,
                        influenced by himpowerfully, perhaps decisively influenced. Norman had no
                        notion of it, but ever after that talk in the laboratory, Dorothy Hallowell
                        was to him Newton Hallowell&apos;s daughter.</p>
                    <p>When he came the following day, with his original purposes and plans once
                        more intact, as he thought, he found that she had made more of a toilet than
                        usual, had devised a new way of doing her hair that enabled him to hang a
                        highly prized addition in his memory gallery of widely varied portraits of
                        her.</p>
                    <p>The afternoon was warm. They sat under a big old tree at the end of the
                        garden. He saw that she was much disturbedand that it had to do with him.
                        From time to time she looked at him, studying his face when she thought
                        herself unobserved. As he had learned that it is never wise to open up the
                        disagreeable, he waited. After making several futile efforts at
                        conversation, she abruptly said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw Mr. Tetlow this morningin Twenty-third Street. I was coming
                        out of a chemical supplies store where father had sent me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She paused. But Norman did not help her. He continued to wait.</p>
                    <p>&quot;HeMr. Tetlowacted very strangely,&quot; she went on.
                        &quot;I spoke to him. He stared at me as if he weren&apos;t going to
                        speakas if I weren&apos;t fit to speak to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Norman.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-203" n="199"/>
                    <p>&quot;Then he came hurrying after me. And he said, &apos;Do you know
                        that Norman is to be married in two weeks?&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So!&quot; said Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I said, &apos;What of it? How does that interest
                        me?&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It didn&apos;t interest you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was surprised that you hadn&apos;t spoken of it,&quot;
                        replied she. &quot;But I was more interested in Mr. Tetlow&apos;s
                        manner. What do you think he said next?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t imagine,&quot; said Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whythat I was even more shameless than he thought. He said:
                        &apos;Oh, I know all about you. I found out by accident. I
                        shan&apos;t tell anyone, for I can&apos;t help loving you still. But
                        it has killed my belief in woman to find out that <hi rend="i">you</hi>
                        would sell yourself.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was looking at Norman with eyes large and grave. &quot;And what did
                        you say?&quot; he inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t say anything. I looked at him as if he
                        weren&apos;t there and started on. Then he said, &apos;When Norman
                        abandons you, as he soon will, you can count on me, if you need a
                        friend.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was a pause. Then Norman said, &quot;And that was all?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied she.</p>
                    <p>Another pause. Norman said musingly: &quot;Poor Tetlow! I&apos;ve not
                        seen him since he went away to Bermudaat least he said he was going there.
                        One <pb id="VAA2369-204" n="200"/> day he sent the firm a formal letter of
                        resignation.... Poor Tetlow! Do you regret not having married him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t marry a man I didn&apos;t love.&quot;
                        She looked at him with sweet friendly eyes. &quot;I couldn&apos;t
                        even marry you, much as I like you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman laugheda dismal attempt at ease and raillery.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When he told me about your marrying,&quot; she went on,
                        &quot;I knew how I felt about you. For I was not a bit jealous. Why
                        haven&apos;t you ever said anything about it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He disregarded this. He leaned forward and with curious deliberateness took
                        her hand. She let it lie gently in his. He put his arm round her and drew
                        her close to him. She did not resist. He kissed her upturned face, kissed
                        her upon the lips. She remained passive, looking at him with calm eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kiss me,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>She kissed himwithout hesitation and without warmth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why do you look at me so?&quot; he demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t understand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Understand what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why you should wish to kiss me when you love another woman. What
                        would she say if she knew?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t know. And I rather think I
                        don&apos;t care. You are the only person on earth that interests
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-205" n="201"/>
                    <p>&quot;Then why are you marrying?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s not talk about that. Let&apos;s talk about
                        ourselves.&quot; He clasped her passionately, kissed her at first with
                        self-restraint, then in a kind of frenzy. &quot;How can you be so
                        cruel!&quot; he cried. &quot;Are you utterly cold?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not love you,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s no reason. Ijust don&apos;t. I&apos;ve
                        sometimes thought perhaps it was because you don&apos;t love
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good God, Dorothy! What do you want me to say or do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; replied she calmly. &quot;You asked me why I
                        didn&apos;t love you, and I was trying to explain. I don&apos;t want
                        anything more than I&apos;m getting. I am contentaren&apos;t
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Content!&quot; He laughed sardonically. &quot;As well ask
                        Tantalus if he is content, with the water always before his eyes and always
                        out of reach. I want youall you have to give. I couldn&apos;t be content
                        with less.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You ought not to talk to me this way,&quot; she reproved
                        gently, &quot;when you are engaged.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He flung her hand into her lap. &quot;You are making a fool of me. And I
                        don&apos;t wonder. I&apos;ve invited it. Surely, never since man was
                        created has there been such another ass as I.&quot; He drew her to her
                        feet, seized her roughly by the shoulders. &quot;When are you coming to
                        your senses?&quot; he demanded.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-206" n="202"/>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she inquired, in her childlike puzzled
                        way.</p>
                    <p>He shook her, kissed her violently, held her at arm&apos;s length.
                        &quot;Do you think it wise to trifle with me?&quot; he asked.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t your good sense tell you there&apos;s a limit
                        even to such folly as mine?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What <hi rend="i">is</hi> the matter?&quot; she asked
                        pathetically. &quot;What do you want? I can&apos;t give you what I
                        haven&apos;t got to give.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; he cried. &quot;But I want what you <hi rend="i"
                            >have</hi> got to give.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head slowly. &quot;Really, I haven&apos;t, Mr.
                        Norman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He eyed her with cynical amused suspicion. &quot;Why did you call me <hi
                            rend="i">Mr.</hi> Norman just then? Usually you don&apos;t call me
                        at all. It&apos;s been weeks since you have called me Mister. Was your
                        doing it just then one of those subtle, adroit, timely tricks of
                        yours?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was the picture of puzzled innocence. &quot;I don&apos;t
                        understand,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wellperhaps you don&apos;t,&quot; said he doubtfully.
                        &quot;At any rate, don&apos;t call me Mr. Norman. Call me
                        Fred.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t. It isn&apos;t natural. You seem Mister to me.
                        I always think of you as Mr. Norman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s it. And it must stop!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She smiled with innocent gayety. &quot;Very wellFred.... Fred.... Now
                        that I&apos;ve said it, I don&apos;t find <pb id="VAA2369-207"
                            n="203"/> it strange.&quot; She looked at him with an expression
                        between appeal and mockery. &quot;If you&apos;d only let me get
                        acquainted with you. But you don&apos;t. You make me feel that
                        I&apos;ve got to be careful with youthat I must be on my guard. I
                        don&apos;t know against whatfor you are certainly the very best friend
                        that I&apos;ve ever hadthe only real friend.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He frowned and bit his lipand felt uncomfortable, though he protested to
                        himself that he was simply irritated at her slyness. Yes, it must be
                        slyness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So,&quot; she went on, &quot;there&apos;s no <hi
                            rend="i">reason</hi> for being on guard. Still, I feel that
                        way.&quot; She looked at him with sweet gravity. &quot;Perhaps I
                        shouldn&apos;t if you didn&apos;t talk about love to me and kiss me
                        in a way I feel you&apos;ve no right to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again he laid his hands upon her shoulders. This time he gazed angrily into
                        her eyes. &quot;Are you a fool? Or are you making a fool of
                        me?&quot; he said. &quot;I can&apos;t decide which.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I certainly am very foolish,&quot; was her apologetic answer.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t know a lot of things, like you and father.
                        I&apos;m only a girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And he had the maddening sense of being baffled againof having got nowhere,
                        of having demonstrated afresh to himself and to her his own weakness where
                        she was concerned. What unbelievable weakness! Had there ever been such
                        another case? Yes, there must have been. How little he had known of the

                    <p>&quot;I suppose so,&quot; replied he sourly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you worried about the expense? Is it costing you too much, this
                        helping father? Are you sorry you went into it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was silent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are sorry?&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;You feel that you
                        are wasting your money?&quot;</p>
                    <p>His generosity forbade him to keep up the pretense that might aid him in his
                        project. &quot;No,&quot; he said hastily. &quot;No, indeed. This
                        expenseit&apos;s nothing.&quot; He flushed, hung his head in shame
                        before his own weakness, as he added, in complete surrender,
                        &quot;I&apos;m very glad to be helping your father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I knew you would be!&quot; she cried triumphantly. &quot;I
                        knew it!&quot; And she flung her arms round his neck and kissed him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s better!&quot; he said with a foolishly
                        delighted laugh. &quot;I believe we are beginning to get
                        acquainted.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, indeed. I feel quite different already.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hoped so. You are coming to your senses?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps. Only&quot; She laid a beautiful white pleading hand
                        upon his shoulder and gazed earnestly into his eyes&quot;please

                    <p>He looked at her uncertainly. &quot;Come round in <pb id="VAA2369-209"
                            n="[205]"/> your own way,&quot; he said at last. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t want to hurry you. I suppose every bird has its own way of
                        dropping from a perch.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t like my way?&quot; she inquired.</p>
                    <p>It was said archly but also in the way that always made him vaguely uneasy,
                        made him feel like one facing a mystery which should be explored cautiously.
                        &quot;It is graceful,&quot; he admitted, with a smile since he could
                        not venture to frown. &quot;Gracefulbut slow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She laughedand he could not but feel that the greater laughter in her too
                        innocent eyes was directed at him. She talked of other thingsand he let

                        from her, when she obviously wished to hold him and failed solely because
                        she did not understand her business. Like every other man, he no sooner
                        began to be attracted by a woman than he began to invest her with a mystery
                        and awe which she either could dissipate by forcing him to see the truth of
                        her commonplaceness or could increase into a power that would enslave him by
                        keeping him agitated and interested and ever satisfied yet ever baffled. But
                        no woman had shown this supreme skill in the art of loveuntil Dorothy
                        Hallowell. She exasperated him. She fascinated him. She kept him so restless
                        that his professional work was all but neglected. Was it her skill? Was it
                        her folly? Was she simply leading him on and on, guided blindly by
                        woman&apos;s instinct to get as much as she could and to give as little
                        as she dared? Or was she protected by a real indifference to himthe
                        strongest, indeed the only invulnerable armor a woman can wear? Was she
                        protecting herself? Or was it merely that he, weakened by his infatuation,
                        was doing the protecting for her?</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-211" n="207"/>
                    <p>Beside these distracting questions, the once all-important matter of
                        professional and worldly ambition seemed not worth troubling about. They
                        even so vexed him that he had become profoundly indifferent as to Josephine.
                        He saw her rarely. When they were alone he either talked neutral subjects or
                        sat almost mute, hardly conscious of her presence. He received her efforts
                        at the customary caressings with such stolidity that she soon ceased to
                        annoy him. They reduced their outward show of affection to a kiss when they
                        met, another when they separated. He was tiredalways tiredworn outhalf
                        sickharassed by business concerns. He did not trouble himself about whether
                        his listless excuses would be accepted or not. He did not care what she
                        thoughtor might thinkor might do.</p>
                    <p>Josephine was typical of the women of the comfortable class. For them the
                        fundamentally vital matters of lifethe profoundly harassing questions of
                        food, clothing, and shelterare arranged and settled. What is there left to
                        occupy their minds? Little but the idle emotions they manufacture and spread
                        foglike over their true natures to hide the barrenness, the monotony. They
                        fool with phrases about art or love or religion or charityfor none of those
                        things can be vivid realities to those who are swathed and stupefied in a
                        luxury they have not to take the least thought to provide for themselves.
                        Like all those women, Josephine fancied herself complexfancied she was a
                        person of variety <pb id="VAA2369-212" n="208"/> and of depth because she
                        repeated with a slight change of wording the things she read in clever books
                        or heard from clever men. There seemed to Norman to be small enough
                        originality, personality, to the ordinary man of the comfortable class; but
                        there was some, because his necessity of struggling with and against his
                        fellow men in the several arenas of active life compelled him to be at least
                        a little of a person. In the women there seemed nothing at allnot even in
                        Josephine. When he listened to her, when he thought of her, nowhe was calmly
                        critical. He judged her as a human specimenjudged much as would have old
                        Newton Hallowell to whom the whole world was mere laboratory.</p>
                    <p>She bored him nowand he made no effort beyond bare politeness to conceal the
                        fact from her. The situation was saved from becoming intolerable by that
                        universal saver of intolerable situations, vanity. She had the ordinary
                        human vanity. In addition, she had the peculiar vanity of woman, the
                        creation of man&apos;s flatteries lavished upon the sex he alternately
                        serves and spurns. In further addition, she had the vanity of her classthe
                        comfortable class that feels superior to the mass of mankind in fortune, in
                        intellect, in taste, in everything desirable. Heaped upon all these vanities
                        was her vanity of high social rankand atop the whole her vanity of great
                        wealth. None but the sweetest and simplest of human beings can stand up and
                        remain human under such a weight as this. If we are at all <pb
                            id="VAA2369-213" n="209"/> fair in our judgments of our fellow men, we
                        marvel that the triumphant classespecially the women, whose point of view is
                        never corrected by the experiences of practical lifeare not more arrogant,
                        more absurdly forgetful of the oneness and the feebleness of humanity.</p>
                    <p>Josephine was by nature one of the sweet and simple souls. And her love for
                        Norman, after the habit of genuine love, had destroyed all the instinct of
                        coquetry. The womanor, the manhas to be indeed interesting, indeed an
                        individuality, to remain interesting when sincerely in love, and so elevated
                        above the petty but potent sex trickeries. Josephine, deeply in love, was
                        showing herself to Norman in her undisguised natural sweet simplicityand
                        monotony. But, while men admire and reverence a sweet and simple feminine
                        souland love her in plays and between the covers of a book and when she is
                        talking highfaluting abstractions of moralityand wax wroth with any other
                        man who ignores or neglects herthey do not in their own persons become
                        infatuated with her. Passion is too much given to moods for that; it has a
                        morbid craving for variety, for the mysterious and the baffling.</p>
                    <p>The only thing that saves the race from ruin through passion is the rarity of
                        those by nature or by art expert in using it. Norman felt that he was paying
                        the penalty for his persistent search for this rarity; one of the basest
                        tricks of destiny upon man is to give him what he wantswealth, or fame, or
                        power, or the woman <pb id="VAA2369-214" n="210"/> who enslaves. Norman felt
                        that destiny had suddenly revealed its resolve to destroy him by giving him
                        not one of the things he wanted, but all.</p>
                    <p>The marriage was not quite two weeks away. About the time that the ordinary
                        plausible excuses for Norman&apos;s neglect, his abstraction, his
                        seeming indifference were exhausted, Josephine&apos;s vanity came
                        forward to explain everything to her, all to her own glory. As the elysian
                        hour approachedso vanity assured herthe man who loved her as her complex
                        soul and many physical and social advantages deserved was overcome with that
                        shy terror of which she had read in the poets and the novelists. A large
                        income, fashionable attire and surroundings, a carriage and a maidthese
                        things gave a woman a subtle and superior intellect and soul. How? Why? No
                        one knew. But everyone admitted, indeed saw, the truth. Further, these
                        beingsthese great ladiesaccording to all the accredited poets, novelists,
                        and other final authorities upon lifealways inspired the most awed and
                        worshipful and diffident feelings in their lovers. Therefore, shethe great
                        ladywas getting but her due. She would have liked something elsesomething
                        common and humanmuch better. But, having always led her life as the
                        conventions dictated, never as the common human heart yearned, she had no
                        keen sense of dissatisfaction to rouse her to revolt and to question. Also,
                        she was breathlessly busy with trousseau and the other arrangements for the
                        grand wedding.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-215" n="211"/>
                    <p>One afternoon she telephoned Norman asking him to come on his way home that
                        evening. &quot;I particularly wish to see you,&quot; she said. He
                        thought her voice sounded rather queer, but he did not take sufficient
                        interest to speculate about it. When he was with her in the small drawing
                        room on the second floor, he noted that her eyes were regarding him
                        strangely. He thought he understood why when she said:
                        &quot;Aren&apos;t you going to kiss me, Fred?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He put on his good-natured, slightly mocking smile. &quot;I thought you
                        were too busy for that sort of thing nowadays.&quot; And he bent and
                        kissed her waiting lips. Then he lit a cigarette and seated himself on the
                        sofa beside herthe sofa at right angles to the open fire.
                        &quot;Well?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>She gazed into the fire for full a minute before she said in a voice of
                        constraint, &quot;What became of thatthat girlthe Miss
                        Hallowell&quot;</p>
                    <p>She broke off abruptly. There was a pause choked with those dizzy pulsations
                        that fill moments of silence and strain. Then with a sob she flung herself
                        against his breast and buried her face in his shoulder.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t answer!&quot; she cried. &quot;I&apos;m
                        ashamed of myself. I&apos;m ashamedashamed!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He put his arm about her shoulders. &quot;But why shouldn&apos;t I
                        answer?&quot; said he in the kindly gentle tone we can all assume when a
                        matter that agitates some one else is wholly indifferent to us.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-216" n="212"/>
                    <p>&quot;Becauseit was aa trap,&quot; she answered hysterically.
                        &quot;Fredthere was a man here this afternoona man named Tetlow. He got
                        in only because he said he came from you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman laughed quietly. &quot;Poor Tetlow!&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He used to be your head clerkdidn&apos;t he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And one of my few friends.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s not your friend, Fred!&quot; she cried, sitting
                        upright and speaking with energy that quivered in her voice and flashed in
                        her fine brown eyes. &quot;He&apos;s your enemya snake in the grassa
                        malicious, poisonous&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman&apos;s quiet, even laugh interrupted. &quot;Oh, no,&quot;
                        said he. &quot;Tetlow&apos;s a good fellow. Anything he said would
                        be what he honestly believedanything he said about me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He pleaded that he was doing it for your good,&quot; she went
                        on with scorn. &quot;They always dolike the people that write father
                        wicked anonymous letters. Hethis man Tetlowhe said he wanted me for the sake
                        of my love for you to save you from yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman glanced at her with amused eyes. &quot;Well, why don&apos;t
                        you? But then you <hi rend="i">are</hi> doing it. You&apos;re marrying
                        me, aren&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again she put her head upon his shoulder. &quot;Indeed I am!&quot;
                        she cried. &quot;And I&apos;d be a poor sort if I let a sneak shake
                        my confidence in you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He patted her shoulder, and there was laughter in <pb id="VAA2369-217"
                            n="213"/> his voice as he said, &quot;But I never professed to be
                        trustworthy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I know you <hi rend="i">used</hi> to&quot; She laughed and
                        kissed his cheek. &quot;Never mind. I&apos;ve heard. But while you
                        were engaged to meabout to marry mewhy, you simply
                        couldn&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Couldn&apos;t what?&quot; inquired he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you want me to tell you what he said?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I know. But do as you like.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe I&apos;d better tell you. I seem to want to get rid of
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was about that girl.&quot; She sat upright and looked at him
                        for encouragement. He nodded. She went on: &quot;He said that if I asked
                        you, you would not dare deny you wereweregiving her money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Her and her father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shrank, startled. Then her lips smiled bravely, and she said,
                        &quot;He didn&apos;t say anything about her father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. That was my own correction of his story.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him with wonder and doubt. &quot;You aren&apos;t<hi
                            rend="i">doing</hi> it, Fred!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>He nodded. &quot;Yes, indeed.&quot; He looked at her placidly.
                        &quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are <hi rend="i">supporting</hi> her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you wish to put it that way,&quot; said he carelessly.
                        &quot;My money pays the billsall the bills.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-218" n="214"/>
                    <p>&quot;Fred!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes? What is it? Why are you so agitated?&quot; He studied her
                        face, then rose, took a final pull at the cigarette, tossed it in the fire.
                        &quot;I must be going,&quot; he said, in a cool, even voice.</p>
                    <p>She started up in a panic. &quot;Fred! What do you mean? Are you angry
                        with me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>His calm regard met hers. &quot;I do not likethis sort of
                        thing,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But surely you&apos;ll explain. Surely I&apos;m entitled to
                        an explanation.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why should <hi rend="i">I</hi> explain? You have evidently found an
                        explanation that satisfies you.&quot; He drew himself up in a quiet
                        gesture of haughtiness. &quot;Besides, it has never been my habit to
                        allow myself to be questioned or to explain myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her eyes widened with terror. &quot;Fred!&quot; she gasped.
                        &quot;What <hi rend="i">do</hi> you mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Precisely what I say,&quot; said he, in the same cool,
                        inevitable way. &quot;A man came to you with a story about me. You
                        listened. A sufficient answer to the story was that I am marrying you. That
                        answer apparently does not content you. Very well. I shall make no
                        other.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She gazed at him uncertainly. She felt him goingand going finally. She seized
                        him with desperate fingers, cried: &quot;I <hi rend="i">am</hi> content.
                        Oh, Freddon&apos;t frighten me this way!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-219" n="215"/>
                    <p>He smiled satirically. &quot;Are you afraid of the scandalbecause
                        everything for the wedding has gone so far?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How can you think that!&quot; cried sheperhaps too vigorously,
                        a woman would have thought.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What else is there for me to think? You certainly haven&apos;t
                        shown any consideration for me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you told me yourself that you were false to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Really? When?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She forgot her fear in a gush of rage rising from sudden realization of what
                        she was doingof how leniently and weakly and without pride she was dealing
                        with this man. &quot;Didn&apos;t you admit&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pardon me,&quot; said he, and his manner might well have calmed
                        the wildest tempest of anger. &quot;I did not admit. I never admit. I
                        leave that to people of the sort who explain and excuse and apologize. I
                        simply told you I was paying the expenses of a family named
                        Hallowell.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But <hi rend="i">why</hi> should you do it, Fred?&quot;</p>
                    <p>His smile was gently satirical. &quot;I thought Tetlow told you
                        why.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t believe him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then why this excitement?&quot;</p>
                    <p>One could understand how the opposition witnesses dreaded facing him.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t know just why,&quot; she stammered.
                        &quot;It seemed to me you were admitting <pb id="VAA2369-220" n="216"/>
                        I mean, you were confirming what that man accused you of.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And of what did he accuse me? I might say, of what do <hi rend="i"
                            >you</hi> accuse me?&quot; When she remained silent he went on:
                        &quot;I am trying to be reasonable, Josephine. I am trying to keep my
                        temper.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The look in her eyesthe fear, the timiditywas a startling revelation of
                        characterof the cowardice with which love undermines the strongest nature.
                        &quot;I know I&apos;ve been foolish and incoherent, Fred,&quot;
                        she pleaded. &quot;ButI love you! And you remember how I always was
                        afraid of that girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just what do you wish to know?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing, dearnothing. I am not sillily jealous. I ought to be
                        admiring you for your generosityyour charity.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s neither the one nor the other,&quot; said he with
                        exasperating deliberateness.</p>
                    <p>She quivered. &quot;Then <hi rend="i">what</hi> is it?&quot; she
                        cried. &quot;You are driving me crazy with your evasions.&quot;
                        Pleadingly, &quot;You must admit they <hi rend="i">are</hi>
                        evasions.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He buttoned his coat in tranquil preparation to depart. She instantly took
                        alarm. &quot;I don&apos;t mean that. It&apos;s my fault, not
                        asking you straight out. Fred, tell mewon&apos;t you? But if you are too
                        cross with me, thendon&apos;t tell me.&quot; She laughed nervously,
                        hiding her submission beneath a seeming of mocking exaggeration of humility.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll be good. I&apos;ll behave.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-221" n="217"/>
                    <p>A man who admired her as a figure, a man who liked her, a man who had no
                        feeling for her beyond the general human feeling of wishing well pretty
                        nearly everybodyin brief, any man but one who had loved her and had gotten
                        over it would have deeply pitied and sympathized with her. Fred Norman said,
                        his look and his tone coolly calm:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am backing Mr. Hallowell in a company for which he is doing
                        chemical research work. We are hatching eggs, out of the shell, so to speak.
                        Also we are aging and rejuvenating arthropods and the like. So far we have
                        declared no dividends. But we have hopes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She gave a hysterical sob of relief. &quot;Then it&apos;s only
                        businessnot the girl at all!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes, it&apos;s the girl, too,&quot; replied he.
                        &quot;She&apos;s an officer of the company. In fact, it was to make
                        a place for her that I went into the enterprise originally.&quot; With
                        an engaging air of frankness he inquired, &quot;Anything more?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was gazing soberly, almost somberly, into the fire.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll not be offended if I ask you one
                        question?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is there anything between you andher?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean, am I having an affair with her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She hung her head, but managed to make a slight nod of assent.</p>
                    <p>He laughed. &quot;No.&quot; He laughed again. &quot;No <pb
                            id="VAA2369-222" n="218"/> not thus far, my dear.&quot; He laughed a
                        third time, with still stronger and stranger mockery. &quot;She
                        congratulated me on my engagement with a sincerity that would have piqued a
                        man who was interested in her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you forgive me?&quot; Josephine said. &quot;What
                        I&apos;ve just been feeling and saying and putting you
                        throughit&apos;s beneath both of us. I suppose a womanno womancan help
                        being nasty where another woman is concerned.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With his satirical good-humored smile, &quot;I don&apos;t in the
                        least blame you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you&apos;ll not think less of me for giving way to a thing
                        so vulgar?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He kissed her with a carelessness that made her wince. But she felt that she
                        deserved itand was grateful. He said: &quot;Why don&apos;t you go
                        over and see for yourself? No doubt Tetlow gave you the addressand no doubt
                        you have remembered it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She colored and hastily turned her head. &quot;Don&apos;t punish
                        me,&quot; she pleaded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Punish you? What nonsense!... Do you want me to take you over? The
                        laboratory would interest youand Miss Hallowell is lovelier than ever. She
                        has an easier life now. Office work wears on women terribly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Josephine looked at him with a beautiful smile of love and trust.
                        &quot;You wish to be sure I&apos;m cured. Well, can&apos;t you
                        see that I am?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-223" n="219"/>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see why you should be. I&apos;ve said nothing
                        one way or the other.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She laughed gayly. &quot;You can&apos;t tempt me. I&apos;m really
                        cured. I think the only reason I had the attack was because Mr. Tetlow so
                        evidently believed he was speaking the truth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No doubt he did think he was. I&apos;m sure, in the same
                        circumstances, I&apos;d think of anyone else just what he thinks of
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then why do you do it, Fred?&quot; urged she with ill-concealed
                        eagerness. &quot;It isn&apos;t fair to the girl, is it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No one but you and Tetlow knows I&apos;m doing it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re mistaken there, dear. Tetlow says a great many
                        people down town are talking about itthat they say you go almost every day
                        to Jersey City to see her. He accuses you of having ruined her reputation.
                        He says she is quite innocent. He blames the whole thing upon you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman, standing with arms folded upon his broad chest, was gazing
                        thoughtfully into the fire.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t mind my telling you these things?&quot; she
                        said anxiously. &quot;Of course, I know they are lies&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So everyone is talking about it,&quot; interrupted he, so
                        absorbed that he had not heard her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t realize how conspicuous you are.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Well, it can&apos;t be
                        helped.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-224" n="220"/>
                    <p>&quot;You can&apos;t afford to be mixed up in a scandal,&quot;
                        she ventured, &quot;or to injure a poor little creatureI&apos;m
                        afraid you&apos;ll have toto stop it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stop it.&quot; His eyes gleamed with mirth, and something else.
                        &quot;It isn&apos;t my habit to heed gossip.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But think of <hi rend="i">her</hi>, Fred!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He smiled ironically. &quot;What a generous, thoughtful dear you
                        are!&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>She blushed. &quot;I&apos;ll admit I don&apos;t like it.
                        I&apos;m not jealousbut I wish you weren&apos;t doing it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So do I!&quot; he exclaimed, with sudden energy that astonished
                        and disquieted her. &quot;So do I! But since it can&apos;t be helped
                        I shall go on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Never had she respected him so profoundly. For the first time she had
                        measured strength with him and had been beaten and routed. She fancied
                        herself enormously proud; for she labored under the common delusion which
                        mistakes for pride the silly vanity of class, or birth, or wealth, or
                        position. She had imagined she would never lower that cherished pride of
                        hers to any man. And she had lowered it into the dust. No wonder women had
                        loved him, she skid to herself; couldn&apos;t he do with them, even the
                        haughtiest of them, precisely as he pleased? He had not tried to calm, much
                        less to end her jealousy; on the contrary, he had let it flame as high as it
                        would, had urged it higher. And she did not dare ask him, even as a loving
                        concession to her weakness, to give up an affair upon which everybody <pb
                            id="VAA2369-225" n="221"/> was putting the natural worst possible
                        construction! On the contrary, she had given him leave to go onbecause she
                        fearedyes, knewthat if she tried to interfere he would take it as evidence
                        that they could not get on together. What a man!</p>
                    <p>But there was more to come that day. As he was finishing dressing for dinner
                        his sister Ursula knocked. &quot;May I come, Frederick?&quot; she
                        said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure,&quot; he cried. &quot;I&apos;m fixing my
                        tie.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ursula, in a gown that displayed the last possiblemany of the homelier women
                        said impossibleinch of her beautiful shoulders, came strolling sinuously in
                        and seated herself on the arm of the divan. She watched him, in his evening
                        shirt, as he with much struggling did his tie. &quot;How young you do
                        look, Fred!&quot; said she. &quot;Especially in just that much
                        clothes. Not a day over thirty.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not exactly a nonogenarian,&quot; retorted he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But usually your facein spite of its smoothness and no wrinkleshas
                        a kind of an old youngor do I mean young old?look. You&apos;ve led such
                        a serious life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Um. That&apos;s the devil of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re looking particularly young to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Same to you, Urse.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I&apos;m not bad for thirty-four. People half believe me
                        when I say I&apos;m twenty-nine.&quot; She glanced <pb
                            id="VAA2369-226" n="222"/> complacently down at her softly glistening
                        shoulders. &quot;I&apos;ve still got my skin.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And a mighty good one it is. Best I ever sawexcept one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She reflected a moment, then smiled. &quot;I know it isn&apos;t
                        Josephine&apos;s. Hers is good but not notable. Eyes and teeth are her
                        strongholds. I suppose it&apos;sthe other lady&apos;s.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Exactly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean the one in Jersey City.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He went on brushing his hair with not a glance at the bomb she had exploded
                        under his very nose.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re a cool one,&quot; she said admiringly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cool?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought you&apos;d jump. I&apos;m sure you never dreamed
                        I knew.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He slid into his white waistcoat and began to button it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Though you might know I&apos;d find out,&quot; she went on,
                        &quot;when everyone&apos;s talking.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everyone&apos;s always talking,&quot; said he
                        indifferently.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And they rattle on to beat the band when they get a chance at a man
                        like you. Do you know what they&apos;re saying?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly. Loosen these straps in the back of my waistcoatthe upper
                        ones, won&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>As she fussed with the buckles she said: &quot;But you don&apos;t
                        know that they say you&apos;re going to pieces <pb id="VAA2369-227"
                            n="223"/> neglecting your caseskeeping away from your officewasting
                        about half of your day with your lady love. They say that you have gone
                        stark madthat you are rushing to ruin.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A little looser. That&apos;s better. Thanks.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And everyone&apos;s wondering when Josephine will hear and go
                        on the rampage. She&apos;s so proud and so stuck on herself that
                        they&apos;re betting she&apos;ll give you the bounce.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well&quot; getting into his coat&quot;you&apos;d
                        delight in that. For you don&apos;t like her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ohsoso,&quot; replied Ursula. &quot;She&apos;s all
                        right, as women go. You know we women don&apos;t ever think any too well
                        of each other. We&apos;re &apos;on.&apos; Now, I&apos;m
                        frank to admit I&apos;m not worth the powder to blow me up. I
                        can&apos;t do anything worth doing. I don&apos;t know anything worth
                        knowingexcept how to dress and make a fool of an occasional man.
                        I&apos;m not a good housekeeper, nor a good wifeand I&apos;d as lief
                        go to jail for two years as have a baby. But <hi rend="i">I</hi> admit
                        I&apos;m n. g. Most women are as poor excuses as I am, yet they think
                        they&apos;re <hi rend="i">grand</hi>!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman, standing before his sister and smiling mysteriously, said:
                        &quot;My dear Urse, let me give you a great truth in a sentence. The
                        value of anything is not its value to itself or in itself, but its value to
                        some one else. A womaneven as incompetent a person as you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Or Josephine.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-228" n="224"/>
                    <p>&quot;or Josephinemay seem to some man to be pricelessly valuable. And if
                        she happens to seem so to him, why, she <hi rend="i">is</hi> so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;MeaningJersey City?&quot;</p>
                    <p>His eyes glittered curiously. &quot;Meaning Jersey City,&quot; he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>A long silence. Then Ursula: &quot;But suppose Josephine hears?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stood beside the doorway, waiting for her to pass out. His face expressed
                        nothing. &quot;Let&apos;s go down. I&apos;m hungry. We were
                        talking about it this afternoon.&quot;</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l>&quot;You and Jo!&quot;</l>
                        <l>&quot;Josephine and I.&quot;</l>
                        <l>&quot;And it&apos;s all right?&quot;</l>
                        <l>&quot;Why not?&quot;</l>
                        <l>&quot;You fooled her?&quot;</l>
                        <l>&quot;I don&apos;t stoop to that sort of thing.&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>&quot;No, indeed,&quot; she laughed. &quot;You rise to heights of
                        deception that would make anyone else giddy. Oh, I&apos;d give anything
                        to have heard.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s nothing to deceive about,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>She shook her head. &quot;You can&apos;t put it over me, Fred.
                        You&apos;ve never before made a fool of yourself about a woman.
                        I&apos;d like to see her. I suppose I&apos;d be amazed.
                        I&apos;ve observed that the women who do the most extraordinary things
                        with men are the most ordinary sort of women.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-229" n="225"/>
                    <p>&quot;Not to the men,&quot; said he bitterly. &quot;Not while
                        they&apos;re doing it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Does <hi rend="i">she</hi> seem extraordinary to <hi rend="i"
                        >you</hi>still?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He thrust his hands deep in his pockets. &quot;What you heard is true.
                        I&apos;m letting everything slideworkcareereverything. I think of
                        nothing else. Ursula, I&apos;m mad about hermad!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She threw back her head, looked at him admiringly. Never had she so utterly
                        worshiped this wonderful, powerful brother of hers. He was in
                        lovereallymadly in loveat last. So he was perfect! &quot;How long do you
                        think it will hold, Fred?&quot; she said, all sympathy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;God knows!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yetcaring for her you can go on and marry another woman!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at his sister cynically. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t have me
                        marry <hi rend="i">her</hi>, would you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course not,&quot; protested she hastily. Her passion for
                        romance did not carry her to that idiocy. &quot;You couldn&apos;t.
                        She&apos;s a sort of working girlisn&apos;t she?anyhow, that class.
                        No, you couldn&apos;t marry her. But how can you marry another
                        woman?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How could I give up Josephine?and give her up probably to Bob
                        Culver?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ursula nodded understandingly. &quot;Butwhat are you going to
                        do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How should I know? Perhaps break it off when <pb id="VAA2369-230"
                            n="[226]"/> I marryif you can call it breaking off, when
                        there&apos;s nothing to break butme.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t mean&quot; she cried, stopping when her tone
                        had carried her meaning.</p>
                    <p>He laughed. &quot;Yesthat&apos;s the kind of damn fool I&apos;ve
                        been.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must have let her see how crazy you were about her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was anyone ever able to hide that sort of insanity?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ursula gazed wonderingly at him, drew a long breath. &quot;You!&quot;
                        she exclaimed. &quot;Of all men<hi rend="i">you</hi>!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s go down.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She must be a deep onedangerous,&quot; said Ursula, furious
                        against the woman who was daring to resist her matchless brother.
                        &quot;Fred, I&apos;m wild to see her. Maybe I&apos;d see
                        something that&apos;d help cure you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You keep out of it,&quot; he replied, curtly but not with ill
                        humor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It can&apos;t last long.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;d do for me, if it did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The marriage will settle everything,&quot; said Ursula with
                        confidence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s got to,&quot; said he grimly.</p>

                        He often called her up on one pretext or another, or frankly for no reason
                        at all beyond the overwhelming desire to hear her voice. But she had never
                        before &quot;disturbed&quot; him. He had again and again assured her
                        that he would not regard himself as &quot;disturbed,&quot; no matter
                        what he might be doing. She would not have it so. As he was always watching
                        for some faint sign that she was really interested in him, this call gave
                        him a thrill of hopea specimen of the minor absurdities of those days of
                        extravagant folly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you coming over to-day?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Right away, if you wish.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no. Any time will do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll come at once. I&apos;m not busy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. Late this afternoon. Father asked me to call up and make sure.

                            n="228"/> resist the impulse to say, &quot;Now that I&apos;ve

                        lunch.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her answering voice was irritated. &quot;Please don&apos;t.

                    <p>He shrank and quivered like a boy who has been publicly rebuked.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll come when you say,&quot; he replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not a minute before four o&apos;clock.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s a long timenow you&apos;ve made me crazy to see

                    <p>&quot;Dusting and polishing. Molly did the sweeping and is cleaning

                    <p>&quot;No one knows that better than I. But I want to have a picture of
                        you to look at.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve got on an old white skirt and an old shirt waist,
                        both dirty, and a pair of tennis shoes that were white once but are gray
                        now, where they aren&apos;t black. And I&apos;ve got a pink chiffon
                        rag tied round my hair.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pink is wonderful when you wear it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I look a fright. And my face is streakedand my arms.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you&apos;ve got your sleeves rolled up. That&apos;s an

                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s quite enough. Good-by.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And she rang off. He was used to her treating compliment and flattery from
                        him in that fashion. He could notor was it would not?understand why. He had
                        learned that she was not at all the indifferent and unaware person in the
                        matter of her physical charms he had at first fancied her. On the contrary,
                        she had more than her share of physical vanitynot more than was her right,
                        in view of her charms, but more than she could carry off well. With many a
                        secret smile he had observed that she thought herself perfect physically.
                        This did not repel him; it never does repel a manwhen and so long as he is
                        under the enchantment of the charms the woman more or less exaggerates. But,
                        while he had often seen women with inordinate physical vanity, so often that
                        he had come to regarding it as an essential part of feminine character,
                        never before had he seen one so content with her own good opinion of herself
                        that she was indifferent to appreciation from others.</p>
                    <p>He did not go back to the office after lunch. Several important matters were
                        coming up; if he got within reach they might conspire to make it impossible
                        for him to be with her on time. If his partners, his clients knew! He the
                        important man of affairs kneeling at the feet of a nobody!and why? Chiefly
                        because he <pb id="VAA2369-234" n="230"/> was unable to convince her that he
                        amounted to anything. His folly nauseated him. He sat in a corner in the
                        dining room of the Lawyers&apos; Club and drank one whisky and soda
                        after another and brooded over his follies and his unhappiness, muttering
                        monotonously from time to time: &quot;No wonder she makes a fool of me.
                        I invite it, I beg for it, damned idiot that I am!&quot; By three
                        o&apos;clock he had drunk enough liquor to have dispatched the average
                        man for several days. It had produced no effect upon him beyond possibly a
                        slight aggravation of his moodiness.</p>
                    <p>It took only twenty minutes to get from New York to her house. He set out at
                        a few minutes after three; arrived at twenty minutes to four. As experience
                        of her ways had taught him that she was much less friendly when he disobeyed
                        her requests, he did not dare go to the house, but, after looking at it from
                        a corner two blocks away, made a detour that would use up some of the time
                        he had to waste. And as he wandered he indulged in his usual alternations
                        between self-derision and passion. He appeared at the house at five minutes
                        to four. Patrick, who with Molly his wife looked after the domestic affairs,
                        was at the front gate gazing down the street in the direction from which he
                        always came. At sight of him Pat came running. Norman quickened his pace,
                        and every part of his nervous system was in turmoil.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Hallowellhe&apos;s<hi rend="i">dead</hi>,&quot; gasped
                        Pat.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-235" n="231"/>
                    <p>&quot;Dead?&quot; echoed Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Three quarters of an hour ago, sir. He came from the lobatry,
                        walked in the sitting room where Miss Dorothy was oiling the furniture and I
                        was oiling the floor. And he sets downand he looks at heras cool and calm as
                        could beand he says, &apos;Dorothy, my child, I&apos;m
                        dying.&apos; And she stands up straight and looks at him curious
                        likejust curious like. And he says, &apos;Dorothy, good-by.&apos;
                        And he shivers, and I jumps up just in time to catch him from rolling to the
                        floor. He was dead thenso the doctor says.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dead!&quot; repeated Norman, looking round vaguely.</p>
                    <p>He went on to the house, Pat walking beside him and chattering on and ona
                        stream of words Norman did not hear. As he entered the open front door
                        Dorothy came down the stairs. He had thought he knew how white her skin was.
                        But he did not know until then. And from that ghostly pallor looked the eyes
                        of grief beyond tears. He advanced toward her. But she seemed to be wrapped
                        in an atmosphere of aloofness. He felt himself a stranger and an alien.
                        After a brief silence she said: &quot;I don&apos;t realize it.
                        I&apos;ve been upstairs where Pat carried himbut I don&apos;t
                        realize it. It simply can&apos;t be.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you know what he wished to say to me?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. I guess he felt this coming. Probably it came quicker than he
                        expected. Now I can see that <pb id="VAA2369-236" n="232"/> he
                        hasn&apos;t been well for several days. But he would never let anything
                        about illness be said. He thought talking of those things made them
                        worse.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have relativessomebody you wish me to telegraph?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head. &quot;No one. Our relatives out West are second
                        cousins or further away. They care nothing about us. No, I&apos;m all
                        alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The tears sprang to his eyes. But there were no tears in her eyes, no
                        folornness in her voice. She was simply stating a fact. He said:
                        &quot;I&apos;ll look after everything. Don&apos;t give it a
                        moment&apos;s thought.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I&apos;ll arrange,&quot; replied she.
                        &quot;It&apos;ll give me something to dosomething to do for him. You
                        see, it&apos;s my last chance.&quot; And she turned to ascend the
                        stairs. &quot;Something to do,&quot; she repeated dully. &quot;I
                        wish I hadn&apos;t cleaned house this morning. That would be something
                        more to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This jarred on himthen brought the tears to his eyes again. How childish she
                        was!and how desolate! &quot;But you&apos;ll let me stay?&quot;
                        he pleaded. &quot;You&apos;ll need me. At any rate, I want to feel
                        that you do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d rather you didn&apos;t stay,&quot; she said,
                        in the same calm, remote way. &quot;I&apos;d rather be alone with
                        him, this last time. I&apos;ll go up and sit there until they take him
                        away. And thenin a few days I&apos;ll see what to doI&apos;ll send
                        for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t leave you at such a time,&quot; he cried.
                        &quot;You <pb id="VAA2369-237" n="233"/> haven&apos;t realized yet.
                        When you do you will need some one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t understand,&quot; she interrupted.
                        &quot;He and I understood each other in some ways. I know he&apos;d
                        not wantanyone round.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At her slight hesitation before &quot;anyone&quot; he winced.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I must be alone with him,&quot; she went on. &quot;Thank
                        you, but I want to go now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not just yet,&quot; he begged. Then, seeing the shadow of
                        annoyance on her beautiful white face, he rose and said:
                        &quot;I&apos;m going. I only want to help you.&quot; He extended
                        his hand impulsively, drew it back before she had the chance to refuse it.
                        For he felt that she would refuse it. He said, &quot;You know you can
                        rely on me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I don&apos;t need anybody,&quot; replied she.
                        &quot;Goodby.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I can do anything&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pat will telephone.&quot; She was already halfway upstairs.</p>
                    <p>He found Pat in the front yard, and arranged with him to get news and to send
                        messages by way of the drug store at the corner, so that she would know
                        nothing about it. He went to a florist&apos;s in New York and sent
                        masses of flowers. And thenthere was nothing more to do. He stopped in at
                        the club and drank and gambled until far into the morning. He fretted
                        gloomily about all the next day, riding alone in the Park, <pb
                            id="VAA2369-238" n="234"/> driving with his sister, drinking and
                        gambling at the club again and smiling cynically to himself at the covert
                        glances his acquaintances exchanged. He was growing used to those glances.
                        He cared not the flip of a penny for them.</p>
                    <p>On the third day came the funeral, and he went. He did not let his cabman
                        turn in behind the one carriage that followed the hearse. At the graveyard
                        he stood afar off, watching her in her simple new black, noting her calm.
                        She seemed thinner, but he thought it might be simply her black dress. He
                        could see no change in her face. As she was leaving the grave, she looked in
                        his direction but he was uncertain whether she had seen him. Pat and Molly
                        were in the big, gloomy looking carriage with her.</p>
                    <p>He ventured to go to the front gate an hour later. Pat came out.
                        &quot;It&apos;s no use to go in, Mr. Norman,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;She&apos;ll not see you. She&apos;s shut up in her own
                        room.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hasn&apos;t she cried yet, Pat?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not yet. We&apos;re waiting for it, sir. We&apos;re afraid
                        her mind will give way. At least, Molly is. I don&apos;t think so.
                        She&apos;s a queer young ladyas queer as she looksthough at first
                        you&apos;d never think it. She&apos;s always looking different. I
                        never seen so many persons in one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t Molly <hi rend="i">make</hi> her cry?by talking
                        about him?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-239" n="235"/>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s tried, sir. It wasn&apos;t no use. Why, Miss
                        Dorothy talks about him just as if he was still here.&quot; Pat wiped
                        the sweat from his forehead. &quot;I&apos;ve been in many a house of
                        mourning, but never through such a strain as this. Somehow I feel as if
                        I&apos;d never before been round where there was anyone that&apos;d
                        lost somebody they <hi rend="i">really</hi> cared about. Weeping and moaning
                        don&apos;t amount to much beside what she&apos;s doing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman stayed round for an hour or more, then rushed away distracted. He
                        drank like a madmandrank himself into a daze, and so got a few hours of a
                        kind of sleep. He was looking haggard and wild now, and everyone avoided
                        him, though in fact there was not the least danger of an outburst of temper.
                        His sisterJosephinethe officeseveral clients telephoned for him. To all he
                        sent the same refusalthat he was too ill to see anyone. Not until the third
                        day after the funeral did Dorothy telephone for him.</p>
                    <p>He took an ice-cold bath, got himself together as well as he could, and
                        reached the house in Jersey City about half past three in the afternoon. She
                        came gliding into the room like a ghost, trailing a black neglige that made
                        the whiteness of her skin startling. Her eyelids were heavy and dark, but
                        unreddened. She gazed at him with calm, clear melancholy, and his heart
                        throbbed and ached for her. She seated herself, clasped her hands loosely in
                        her lap, and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve sent for you so that I could settle things
                        up.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-240" n="236"/>
                    <p>&quot;Your father&apos;s affairs? Can&apos;t I do it
                        better?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He had arranged everything. There are only the papershis notesand
                        he wrote out the addresses of the men they were to be sent to. No, I mean
                        settle things up with you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t bother about that,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;Besides, there&apos;s nothing to settle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shan&apos;t pretend I&apos;m going to try to pay you
                        back,&quot; she went on, as if he had not spoken. &quot;I never
                        could do it. But you will get part at least by selling this furniture and
                        the things at the laboratory.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dorothyplease,&quot; he implored. &quot;Don&apos;t you
                        understand you&apos;re to stay on here, just the same? What sort of man
                        do you think I am? I did this for you, and you know it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But <hi rend="i">I</hi> did it for my father,&quot; replied
                        she, &quot;and he&apos;s gone.&quot; She was resting her
                        melancholy gaze upon him. &quot;I couldn&apos;t take anything from
                        you. You didn&apos;t think I was that kind?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was silent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I cared nothing about the scandalwhat people saidso long as I was
                        doing it for him.... I&apos;d have done <hi rend="i">anything</hi> for
                        him. Sometimes I thought you were going to compel me to do things
                        I&apos;d have hated to do. I hope I wronged you, but I feared you meant
                        that.&quot; She sat thinking several minutes, sighed wearily.
                        &quot;It&apos;s all over now. It doesn&apos;t matter. I
                        needn&apos;t bother about it any more.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-241" n="237"/>
                    <p>&quot;Dorothy, let&apos;s not talk of these things now,&quot;
                        said Norman. &quot;There&apos;s no hurry. I want you to wait until
                        you are calm and have thought everything over. Then I&apos;m sure
                        you&apos;ll see that you ought to stay on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How could I?&quot; she asked wonderingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not? Am I demanding anything of you? You know I&apos;m
                        notand that I never shall.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But there&apos;s no reason on earth why <hi rend="i">you</hi>
                        should support <hi rend="i">me</hi>. I can work. Why shouldn&apos;t I?
                        And if I didn&apos;t, if I stayed on here, what sort of woman would I
                        be?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was unable to find an answer. He was trying not to see a look in her
                        faceor was it in her soul, revealed through her eyes?a look that made him
                        think for the first time of a resemblance between her and her father.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You see yourself I&apos;ve got to go. Any money I could earn
                        wouldn&apos;t more than pay for a room and board somewhere.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can let me advance you money while you&quot; He hesitated,
                        had an idea which he welcomed eagerly&quot;while you study for the
                        stage. Yes, that&apos;s the sensible thing. You can learn to act. Then
                        you will be able to make a decent living.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She slowly shook her head. &quot;I&apos;ve no talent for itand no
                        liking. No, Mr. Norman, I must go back to workand right away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But at least wait until you&apos;ve looked into the stage <pb
                            id="VAA2369-242" n="238"/> business,&quot; he urged. &quot;You
                        may find that you like it and that you have talent for it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t take any more from you,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think I am not to be trusted. I&apos;m not going to say now
                        how I feel toward you. But I can honestly say one thing. Now that you are
                        all alone and unprotected, you needn&apos;t have the least fear of
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She smiled faintly. &quot;I see you don&apos;t believe me. Well, it
                        doesn&apos;t matter. I&apos;ve seen Mr. Tetlow and he has given me a
                        place at twelve a week in his office.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman sank back in his chair. &quot;He is in for himself now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. He&apos;s head clerk for Pitchley &amp;
                        Culver.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Culver!&quot; exclaimed Norman. &quot;I don&apos;t want
                        you to go into Culver&apos;s office. He&apos;s a
                        scoundrel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again Dorothy smiled faintly. Norman colored. &quot;I know he stands
                        wellas well as I do. But I can&apos;t trust you with him. That sounds
                        ridiculous butit&apos;s true.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I can trust myself,&quot; she said quietly. Her grave
                        regard fixed his. &quot;Don&apos;t you?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>His eyes lowered. &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied. &quot;Butwhy
                        shouldn&apos;t you come back with us? I&apos;ll see that you get a
                        much better position than Culver&apos;s giving you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Over her face crept one of those mysterious transformations that made her so
                        bafflingly fascinating to him. Behind that worldly-wise, satirical mask was
                        she mocking at him? All she said was: &quot;I couldn&apos;t work <pb
                            id="VAA2369-243" n="239"/> there. I&apos;ve settled it with Mr.
                        Tetlow. I go to work to-morrow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To-morrow!&quot; he cried, starting up.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I&apos;ve found a place to live. Pat and Molly will take
                        care of things for you here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dorothy! You don&apos;t <hi rend="i">mean</hi> this?
                        You&apos;re not going to break off?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shan&apos;t see you againexcept as we may meet by
                        accident.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you realize what you&apos;re saying means to me?&quot;
                        he cried. &quot;Don&apos;t you know how I love you?&quot; He
                        advanced toward her. She stood and waited passively, looking at him.
                        &quot;Dorothymy lovedo you want to kill me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When are you to be married?&quot; she asked quietly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are playing with me!&quot; he cried. &quot;You are
                        tormenting me. What have I ever done that you should treat me this
                        way?&quot; He caught her unresisting hands and kissed them.
                        &quot;Dearmy deardon&apos;t you care for me at all?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she said placidly. &quot;I&apos;ve always
                        told you so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He seized her in his arms, kissed her with a frenzy that was savage,
                        ferocious. &quot;You will drive me mad. You <hi rend="i">have</hi>
                        driven me mad!&quot; he muttered. And he added, unconscious that he was
                        speaking his thoughts, so distracted was he: &quot;You <hi rend="i"
                        >must</hi> love meyou <hi rend="i">must!</hi> No woman has ever resisted me.
                        You cannot.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She drew herself away from him, stood before him <pb id="VAA2369-244" n="240"
                        /> like snow, like ice. &quot;One thing I have never told you.
                        I&apos;ll tell you now,&quot; she said deliberately. &quot;I
                        despise you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He fell back a step and the chill of her coldness seemed to be freezing the
                        blood in his veins.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve always despised you,&quot; she went on, and he
                        shivered before that contemptuous wordit seemed only the more contemptuous
                        for her calmness. &quot;Sometimes I&apos;ve despised you
                        thoroughlyagain only a littlebut always that feeling.&quot;</p>
                    <p>For a moment he thought she had at last stung his pride into the semblance of
                        haughtiness. He was able to look at her with mocking eyes and to say,
                        &quot;I congratulate you on your cleverness in concealing your
                        feelings.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It wasn&apos;t my cleverness,&quot; she said wearily.
                        &quot;It was your blindness. I never deceived you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, you never have,&quot; he replied sincerely.
                        &quot;Perhaps I deserve to be despised. Again, perhaps if you knew the
                        worldthe one I live inbetter, you&apos;d think less harshly of
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think harshly of you. How could Iafter all you did
                        for my father?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dorothy, if you&apos;ll stay here and study for the stageor
                        anything you chooseI promise you I&apos;ll never speak of my feeling for
                        youor show it in any wayunless you yourself give me leave.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She smiled with childlike pathos. &quot;You ought not <pb
                            id="VAA2369-245" n="[241]"/> to tempt me. Do you want me to keep on
                        despising you? Can&apos;t you ever be fair with me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The sad, frank gentleness of the appeal swung his unhinged mind to the other
                        extremefrom the savagery of passion to a frenzy of remorse. &quot;Fair
                        to <hi rend="i">you</hi>? No,&quot; he cried, &quot;because I love
                        you. Oh, I&apos;m ashamedbitterly ashamed. I&apos;m capable of any
                        baseness to get you. You&apos;re right. You can&apos;t trust me. In
                        going you&apos;re saving me from myself.&quot; He hesitated, stared
                        wildly, appalled at the words that were fighting for utterancethe words
                        about marriageabout marrying her! He said hoarsely: &quot;I am madmad! I
                        don&apos;t know what I&apos;m saying. Good-by For God&apos;s
                        sake, don&apos;t think the worst of me, Dorothy. Good-by. I <hi rend="i"
                            >will</hi> be a man againI will!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And he wrung her hand and, talking incoherently, he rushed from the room and
                        from the house.</p>

                    <p>H<hi rend="sc">E</hi> went straight home and sought his sister. She had that
                        moment come in from tea after a matine. She talked about the playhow badly
                        it was actedand about the women she had seen at teahow badly dressed they
                        were. &quot;It&apos;s hard to say which is the more dreadfulthe
                        ugly, misshapen human race without clothes or in the clothes it insists on
                        wearing. And the talk at that tea! Does no one ever say a pleasant thing
                        about anyone? Doesn&apos;t anyone ever do a pleasant thing that can be
                        spoken about? I read this morning Tolstoy&apos;s advice about resolving
                        to think all day only nice thoughts and sticking to it. That sounded good to
                        me, and I decided to try it.&quot; Ursula laughed and squirmed about in
                        her tight-fitting dress that made an enchanting display of her figure.
                        &quot;What is one to do? <hi rend="i">I</hi> can&apos;t be a fraud,
                        for one. And if I had stuck to my resolution I&apos;d have spent the day
                        in lying. What&apos;s the matter, Fred?&quot; Now that her attention
                        was attracted she observed more closely. &quot;What <hi rend="i"
                        >have</hi> you been doing? You lookfrightful!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve broken with her,&quot; replied he.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-247" n="243"/>
                    <p>&quot;With Jo?&quot; she cried. &quot;Why, Fred, you
                        can&apos;tyou can&apos;twith the wedding only five days
                        away!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not with Jo.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ursula breathed noisy relief. She said cheerfully: &quot;Ohwith the
                        other. Well, I&apos;m glad it&apos;s over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Over?&quot; said he sardonically. &quot;Over? It&apos;s
                        only begun.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you&apos;ll stick it out, Fred. You&apos;ve made a fool
                        of yourself long enough. What was the girl playing for? Marriage?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He nodded. &quot;I guess so.&quot; He laughed curtly. &quot;And
                        she almost won.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ursula smiled with fine mockery. &quot;Almost, but not quite. I know you
                        men. Women do that sort of fool thing. But menneverat least not the
                        ambitious, snobbish New York men.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She almost won,&quot; he repeated. &quot;At least, I almost
                        did it. If I had stayed a minute longer I&apos;d have done it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You like to think you would,&quot; mocked Ursula. &quot;But
                        if you had tried to say the words your lungs would have collapsed, your
                        vocal chords snapped and your tongue shriveled.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not so damn sure I shan&apos;t do it yet,&quot; he
                        burst out fiercely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I am,&quot; said Ursula, calm, brisk, practical.
                        &quot;What&apos;s she going to do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Going to work.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-248" n="244"/>
                    <p>Ursula laughed joyously. &quot;What a joke! A woman go to work when she
                        needn&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is going to work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To work another man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She meant it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How easily women fool men!even the wise men like you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She meant it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She still hopes to marry youor she has heard of your
                        marriage&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman lifted his head. Into his face came the cynical, suspicious
                        expression.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And has fastened on some other man. Or perhaps she&apos;s found
                        some good provider who&apos;s willing to marry her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman sprang up, his eyes blazing, his mouth working cruelly. &quot;By
                        God!&quot; he cried. &quot;If I thought that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>His sister was alarmed. Such a manin such a deliriummight commit any
                        absurdity. He flung himself down in despair. &quot;Urse, why
                        can&apos;t I get rid of this thing? It&apos;s ruining me.
                        It&apos;s killing me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your good sense tells you if you had her you&apos;d be over
                        it&quot; She snapped her fingers&quot;like that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;YesyesI know it! But&quot; He groaned&quot;she has broken
                        with me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ursula went to him and kissed him and took his head in her arms.
                        &quot;What a <hi rend="i">boy</hi>-boy it is!&quot; she said <pb
                            id="VAA2369-249" n="245"/> tenderly. &quot;Oh, it must be dreadful
                        to have always had whatever one wanted and then to find something one
                        can&apos;t have. We women are used to itand the usual sort of man. But
                        not your sort, Freddyand I&apos;m so sorry for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want her, UrseI want her,&quot; he groaned, and he was almost
                        sobbing. &quot;My God, I <hi rend="i">can&apos;t</hi> get on without
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, Freddy dear, listen to me. You know she&apos;s
                        &apos;way, &apos;way beneath youthat she isn&apos;t at all what
                        you&apos;ve got in the habit of picturing herthat it&apos;s all
                        delusion and nonsense&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want her,&quot; he repeated. &quot;I want her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d be ashamed if you had her as a wifewouldn&apos;t
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was silent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She isn&apos;t a <hi rend="i">lady.</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; replied he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She hasn&apos;t any sense. A low sort of cunning, yes. But not
                        brainsnot enough to hold you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; replied he.
                        &quot;She&apos;s got enough for a woman. AndI <hi rend="i">want</hi>
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She isn&apos;t to be compared with Josephine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I don&apos;t want Josephine. I want <hi rend="i"
                        >her.</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But which do you want to <hi rend="i">marry</hi>?to bring forward
                        as your wife?to spend your life with?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know. I&apos;m a mad fool. But, Urse, I can&apos;t help
                        it.&quot; He stood up suddenly. &quot;I&apos;ve used every
                        weapon <pb id="VAA2369-250" n="246"/> I&apos;ve got. Even prideand it
                        skulked away. My sense of humorand it weakened. My willand it
                        snapped.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is she so wonderful?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is soelusive. I can&apos;t understand herI can&apos;t
                        touch her. I can&apos;t find her. She keeps me going like a man chasing
                        an echo.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Like a man chasing an echo,&quot; repeated Ursula reflectively.
                        &quot;I understand. It is maddening. She must be cleverin her
                        way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Or very simple. God knows which; I don&apos;tand sometimes I
                        think she doesn&apos;t, either.&quot; He made a gesture of
                        dismissal. &quot;Well, it&apos;s finished. I must pull myself
                        togetheror try to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will,&quot; said his sister confidently. &quot;A
                        fortnight from now you&apos;ll be laughing at yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am now. I have been all along. Butit does no good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She had to go and dress. But she could not leave until she had tried to make
                        him comfortable. He was drinking brandy and soda and staring at his feet
                        which were stretched straight out toward the fire.
                        &quot;Where&apos;s your sense of humor?&quot; she demanded.
                        &quot;Throw yourself on your sense of humor. It&apos;s a friend that
                        sticks when all others fail.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s my only hope,&quot; he said with a grim smile.
                        &quot;I can see myself. No wonder she despises me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Despises you?&quot; scoffed Ursula. &quot;A <hi rend="i"
                            >woman</hi> despise <pb id="VAA2369-251" n="247"/>
                        <hi rend="i">you</hi>! She&apos;s crazy about you, I&apos;ll bet
                        anything you like. Before you&apos;re through with this you&apos;ll
                        find out I&apos;m right. And thenyou&apos;ll have no use for
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She despises me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wellwhat of it? Really, Fred, it irritates me to see you absolutely
                        unlike yourself. Why, you&apos;re as broken-spirited as a henpecked old
                        husband.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just that,&quot; he admitted, rising and looking drearily
                        about. &quot;I don&apos;t know what the devil to do next. Everything
                        seems to have stopped.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Going to see Josephine this evening?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose so,&quot; was his indifferent reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll have to dress after dinner. There&apos;s no
                        time now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dress?&quot; he inquired vaguely. &quot;Why dress? Why do
                        anything?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She thought he would not go to Josephine but would hide in his club and
                        drink. But she was mistaken. Toward nine o&apos;clock he, in evening
                        dress, with the expression of a horse in a treadmill, rang the bell of
                        Josephine&apos;s house and passed in at the big bronze doors. The butler
                        must have particularly admired the way he tossed aside his coat and hat. As
                        soon as he was in the presence of his fiance he saw that she was again in
                        the throes of some violent agitation.</p>
                    <p>She began at once: &quot;I&apos;ve just had the most frightful scene
                        with father,&quot; she said. &quot;He&apos;s been hearing a lot
                        of stuff about you down town and it set him wild.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-252" n="248"/>
                    <p>&quot;Do you mind if I smoke a cigar?&quot; said he, looking at her
                        unseeingly with haggard, cold eyes. &quot;And may I have some
                        whisky?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She rang. &quot;I hope the servants didn&apos;t hear him,&quot;
                        she said. Then, as a step sounded outside she put on an air of gayety, as if
                        she were still laughing at some jest he had made. In the doorway appeared
                        her fatherone of those big men who win half the battle in advance on
                        personal appearance of unconquerable might. Burroughs was noted for his
                        generosity and for his violent temper. As a rule men of the largeness
                        necessary to handling large affairs are free from petty vindictiveness. They
                        are too busy for hatred. They do not forgive; they are most careful not to
                        forget; they simply stand ready at any moment to do whatever it is to their
                        interest to do, regardless of friendships or animosities. Burroughs was an
                        exception in that he got his highest pleasure out of pursuing his enemies.
                        He enjoyed this so keenly that several timesso it was saidhe had sacrificed
                        real money to satisfy a revenge. But these rumors may have wronged him. It
                        is hardly probable that a man who would let a weakness carry him to that
                        pitch of folly could have escaped destruction. For of all the follies
                        revenge is the most dangerousas well as the most fatuous.</p>
                    <p>Burroughs had a big face. Had he looked less powerful the bigness of his
                        features, the spread of cheek and jowl, would have been grotesque. As it
                        was, the <pb id="VAA2369-253" n="249"/> face was impressive, especially when
                        one recalled how many, many millions he owned and how many more he
                        controlled. The control was better than the ownership. The millions he owned
                        made him a cowardhe was afraid he might lose them. The millions he
                        controlled, and of course used for his own enrichment, made him brave, for
                        if they were lost in the daring ventures in which he freely staked them,
                        why, the loss was not his, and he could shift the blame. Usually Norman
                        treated him with great respect, for his business gave the firm nearly half
                        its total income, and it was his daughter and his wealth, prestige and
                        power, that Norman was marrying. But this evening he looked at the great man
                        with a superciliousness that was peculiarly disrespectful from so young a
                        man to one well advanced toward old age. Norman had been feeling relaxed,
                        languid, exhausted. The signs of battle in that powerful face nerved him,
                        keyed him up at once. He waited with a joyful impatience while the servant
                        was bringing cigars and whisky. The enormous quantities of liquor he had
                        drunk in the last few days had not been without effect. Alcohol, the general
                        stimulant, inevitably brings out in strong relief a man&apos;s dominant
                        qualities. The dominant quality of Norman was love of combat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Josephine tells me you are in a blue fury,&quot; said Norman
                        pleasantly when the door was closed and the three were alone.
                        &quot;Nonot a blue fury. A black fury.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-254" n="250"/>
                    <p>At the covert insolence of his tone Josephine became violently agitated.
                        &quot;Father,&quot; she said, with the imperiousness of an only and
                        indulged child, &quot;I have asked you not to interfere between Fred and
                        me. I thought I had your promise.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I said I&apos;d think about it,&quot; replied her father.
                        He had a heavy voice that now and then awoke some string of the lower
                        octaves of the piano in the corner to a dismal groan.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve decided to speak out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s right, sir,&quot; said Norman. &quot;Is
                        your quarrel with me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Josephine attempted an easy laugh. &quot;It&apos;s that silly story
                        we were talking about the other day, Fred.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I supposed so,&quot; said he. &quot;You are not smoking,
                        Mr. Burroughs&quot; He laughed amiably&quot;at least not a
                        cigar.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The doctor only allows me one, and I&apos;ve had it,&quot;
                        replied Burroughs, his eyes sparkling viciously at this flick of the whip.
                        &quot;What is the truth about that business, Norman?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman&apos;s amused glance encountered the savage glare mockingly.
                        &quot;Why do you ask?&quot; he inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because my daughter&apos;s happiness is at stake. Because I
                        cannot but resent a low scandal about a man who wishes to marry my
                        daughter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very proper, sir,&quot; said Norman graciously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My daughter,&quot; continued Burroughs with accelerating anger,
                        &quot;tells me you have denied the story.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-255" n="[]"/>
                    <figure entity="VAA2369-3">
                        <p>&quot;&apos;Father ... I have asked you not to interfere between
                            Fred and me.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    </figure>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-256" n="251"/>
                    <p>Norman interrupted with an astonished look at Josephine. She colored, gazed
                        at him imploringly. His face terrified her. When body and mind are in health
                        and at rest the fullness of the face hides the character to a great extent.
                        But when a human being is sick or very tired the concealing roundness goes
                        and in the clearly marked features the true character is revealed. In
                        Norman&apos;s face, haggard by his wearing emotions, his character stood
                        forththe traits of strength, of tenacity, of inevitable purpose. And
                        Josephine saw and dreaded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But,&quot; Burroughs went on, &quot;I have it on the best
                        authority that it is true.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman, looking into the fascinating face of danger, was thrilled.
                        &quot;Then you wish to break off the engagement?&quot; he said in
                        the gentlest, smoothest tone.</p>
                    <p>Burroughs brought his fist down on the tableand Norman recognized the gesture
                        of the bluffer. &quot;I wish you to break off with that woman!&quot;
                        he cried. &quot;I insist upon itupon positive assurances from
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fred!&quot; pleaded Josephine. &quot;Don&apos;t listen
                        to him. Remember, <hi rend="i">I</hi> have said nothing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He had long been looking for a justifying grievance against her. It now
                        seemed to him that he had found it. &quot;Why should you?&quot; he
                        said genially but with subtle irony, &quot;since you are getting your
                        father to speak for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was just enough truth in this to entangle her <pb id="VAA2369-257"
                            n="252"/> and throw her into disorder. She had been afraid of the
                        consequences of her father&apos;s interfering with a man so spirited as
                        Norman, but at the same time she had longed to have some one put a check
                        upon him. Norman&apos;s suave remark made her feel that he could see
                        into her inmost soulcould see the anger, the jealousy, the doubt, the
                        hatred-tinged love, the love-saturated hate seething and warring there.</p>
                    <p>Burroughs was saying: &quot;If we had not committed ourselves so deeply,
                        I should deal very differently with this matter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why should that deter you?&quot; said Normanand Josephine gave
                        a piteous gasp. &quot;If this goes much farther, I assure you <hi
                            rend="i">I</hi> shall not be deterred.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Burroughs, firmly planted in a big leather chair, looked at the young man in
                        puzzled amazement. &quot;I see you think you have us in your
                        power,&quot; he said at last. &quot;But you are mistaken.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;On the contrary,&quot; rejoined the young man, &quot;I see
                        you believe you have me in your power. And in a sense you are <hi rend="i"
                            >not</hi> mistaken.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father, he is right,&quot; cried Josephine agitatedly.
                        &quot;I shouldn&apos;t love and respect him as I do if he would
                        submit to this hectoring.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hectoring!&quot; exclaimed Burroughs. &quot;Josephine,
                        leave the room. I cannot discuss this matter properly before you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope you will not leave, Josephine,&quot; said Norman. <pb
                            id="VAA2369-258" n="253"/> &quot;There is nothing to be said that
                        you cannot and ought not to hear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not an infant, father,&quot; said Josephine.
                        &quot;Besides, it is as Fred says. He has done
                        nothingimproper.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then why does he not say so?&quot; demanded Burroughs, seeing a
                        chance to recede from his former too advanced position.
                        &quot;That&apos;s all I ask.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I told you all about it, father,&quot; said Josephine
                        angrily. &quot;They&apos;ve been distorting the truth, and the truth
                        is to his credit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman avoided the glance she sent to him; it was only a glance and away, for
                        more formidably than ever his power was enthroned in his haggard face. He
                        stood with his back to the fire and it was plain that the muscles of his
                        strong figure were braced to give and to receive a shock. &quot;Mr.
                        Burroughs,&quot; he said, &quot;your daughter is mistaken. Perhaps
                        it is my faultin having helped her to mislead herself. The plain truth is, I
                        have become infatuated with a young woman. She cares nothing about mehas
                        repulsed me. I have been and am making a fool of myself about her.
                        I&apos;ve been hoping to cure myself. I still hope. But I am not
                        cured.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was absolute silence in the room. Norman stole a glance at Josephine.
                        She was sitting erect, a greenish pallor over her ghastly face.</p>
                    <p>He said: &quot;If she will take me, now that she knows <pb
                            id="VAA2369-259" n="254"/> the truth, I shall be gratefuland I shall
                        make what effort I can to do my best.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her and she at him. And for an instant her eyes softened. There
                        was the appeal of weak human heart to weak human heart in his gaze. Her lip
                        quivered. A brief struggle between vanity and loveand vanity, the stronger,
                        the strongest force in her life, dominating it since earliest babyhood and
                        only seeming to give way to love when love cameit was vanity that won. She
                        stiffened herself and her mouth curled with proud scorn. She laugheda sneer
                        of jealous rage. &quot;Father,&quot; she said, &quot;the lady in
                        the case is a common typewriter in his office.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But to menespecially to practical mendifferences of rank and position among
                        women are not fundamentally impressive. Man is in the habit of taking what
                        he wants in the way of womankind wherever he finds it, and he understands
                        that habit in other men. He was furious with Norman, but he did not
                        sympathize with his daughter&apos;s extreme attitude. He said to Norman
                        sharply:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You say you have broken with the woman?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She has broken with me,&quot; replied Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;At any rate, everything is broken off.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Apparently.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then there is no reason why the marriage should not go
                        on.&quot; He turned to his daughter. &quot;If you understood men,
                        you would attach no importance to this <pb id="VAA2369-260" n="255"/>
                        matter. As you yourself said, the woman isn&apos;t a ladyisn&apos;t
                        in our class. That sort of thing amounts to nothing. Norman has acted well.
                        He has shown the highest kind of honestyhas been truthful where most men
                        would have shifted and lied. Anyhow, things have gone too far.&quot; Not
                        without the soundest reasons had Burroughs accepted Norman as his
                        son-in-law; and he had no fancy for giving him up, when men of his preminent
                        fitness were so rare.</p>
                    <p>There was another profound silence. Josephine looked at Norman. Had he
                        returned her gaze, the event might have been different; for within her there
                        was now going on a struggle between two nearly evenly matched vanitiesthe
                        vanity of her own outraged pride and the vanity of what the world would say
                        and think, if the engagement were broken off at that time and in those
                        circumstances. But he did not look at her. He kept his eyes fixed upon the
                        opposite wall, and there was no sign of emotion of any kind in his stony
                        features. Josephine rose, suppressed a sob, looked arrogant scorn from eyes
                        shining with tearstears of selfpity. &quot;Send him away,
                        father,&quot; she said. &quot;He has tried to degrade <hi rend="i"
                            >me!</hi> I am done with him.&quot; And she rushed from the room,
                        her father half starting from his chair to detain her.</p>
                    <p>He turned angrily on Norman. &quot;A hell of a mess you&apos;ve
                        made!&quot; he cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A hell of a mess,&quot; replied the young man.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-261" n="[256]"/>
                    <p>&quot;Of course she&apos;ll come round. But you&apos;ve got to do
                        your part.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s settled,&quot; said Norman. And he threw his
                        cigar into the fireplace. &quot;Good night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold on!&quot; cried Burroughs. &quot;Before you go, you
                        must see Josie alone and talk with her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It would be useless,&quot; said Norman. &quot;You know
                        her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Burroughs laid his hand friendlily but heavily upon the young man&apos;s
                        shoulder. &quot;This outburst of nonsense might cost you two young
                        people your happiness for life. This is no time for jealousy and false
                        pride. Wait a moment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Norman. &quot;But it is
                        useless.&quot; He understood Josephine nowhe who had become a
                        connoisseur of love. He knew that her vanity-founded love had vanished.</p>
                    <p>Burroughs disappeared in the direction his daughter had taken. Norman waited
                        several minuteslong enough slowly to smoke a cigarette. Then he went into
                        the hall and put on his coat with deliberation. No one appeared, not even a
                        servant. He went out into the street.</p>
                    <p>In the morning papers he found the announcement of the withdrawal of the
                        invitationsand from half a column to several columns of comment, much of it
                        extremely unflattering to him.</p>

                    <p>W<hi rend="sc">HEN</hi> a &quot;high life&quot; engagement such as
                        that of Norman and Miss Burroughs, collapses on the eve of the wedding, the
                        gossip and the scandal, however great, are but a small part of the mess.
                        Doubtless many a marriageand not in high life alone, eitherhas been put
                        through, although the one party or the other or both have discovered that
                        disaster was inevitablesolely because of the appalling muddle the sensible
                        course would precipitate. In the case of the Norman-Burroughs fiasco, there
                        wereto note only a few big itemssuch difficulties as several car loads of
                        presents from all parts of the earth to be returned, a house furnished
                        throughout and equipped to the last scullery maid and stable boy to be
                        disposed of, the entire Burroughs domestic economy which had been
                        reconstructed to be put back upon its former basis.</p>
                    <p>It is not surprising that, as Ursula Fitzhugh was credibly informed,
                        Josephine almost decided to send for Bob Culver and marry him on the day
                        before the day appointed for her marriage to Fred. The reason given for her
                        not doing this sounded plausible. Culver, despairing of making the match on
                        which his ambition <pb id="VAA2369-263" n="258"/> and therefore his heart
                        was setand seeing a chance to get suddenly rich, had embarked for a career
                        as a blackmailer of corporations. That is, he nosed about for a big
                        corporation stealthily doing or arranging to do some unlawful but highly
                        profitable acts; he bought a few shares of its stock, using a fake client as
                        a blind; he then proceeded to threaten it with exposure, expensive
                        hindrances and the like, unless it bought him off at a huge profit to
                        himself. This business was regarded as most disreputable andthanks to the
                        power of the big corporations over the courtshad resulted in the sending of
                        several of its practisers to jail or on hasty journeys to foreign climes.
                        But Culver, almost if not quite as good a lawyer as Norman, was too clever
                        to be caught in that way. However, while he was getting very rich rapidly,
                        he was as yet far from rich enough to overcome the detestation of old
                        Burroughs, and to be eligible for the daughter.</p>
                    <p>So, Josephine sailed away to Europe, with the consolation that her father was
                        so chagrined by the fizzle that he had withdrawn his veto upon the purchase
                        of a foreign titlethat veto having been the only reason she had looked at
                        home for a husband. Strange indeed are the ways of lovenever stranger than
                        when it comes into contact with the vanities of wealth and social position
                        and the other things that cause a human being to feel that he or she is
                        lifted clear of and high above the human condition. Josephine had her
                        consolation. For <pb id="VAA2369-264" n="259"/> Norman the only consolation
                        was escape from a marriage which had become so irksome in anticipation that
                        he did not dare think what it would be in the reality. Over against this
                        consolation was set a long list of disasters. He found himself immediately
                        shunned by all his friends. Their professed reason was that he had acted
                        shabbily in the breaking of the engagement; for, while it was assumed that
                        Josephine must have done the actual breaking, it was also assumed that he
                        must have given her provocation and to spare. This virtuous indignation was
                        in large part mere pretext, as virtuous indignation in frail mortals toward
                        frail mortals is apt to be. The real reason for shying off from Norman was
                        his atmosphere of impending downfall. And certainly that atmosphere had
                        eaten away and dissipated all his former charm. He looked dull and
                        boresomeand he was.</p>
                    <p>But the chief disaster was material. As has been said, old Burroughs, in his
                        own person and in the enterprises he controlled, gave Norman&apos;s firm
                        about half its income. The day Josephine sailed, Lockyer, senior partner of
                        the firm, got an intimation that unless Norman left, Burroughs would take
                        his law business elsewhere, and would &quot;advise&quot; others of
                        their clients to follow his example. Lockyer no sooner heard than he began
                        to bestir himself. He called into consultation the learned Benchley and the
                        astute Sanders and the soft and sly Lockyer junior. There could be no
                        question <pb id="VAA2369-265" n="260"/> that Norman must be got rid of. The
                        only point was, who should inform the lion that he had been deposed?</p>
                    <p>After several hours of anxious discussion, Lockyer, his inward perturbations
                        hid beneath that mask of smug and statesmanlike respectability, entered the
                        lion&apos;s dena sick lion, sick unto death probably, but not a dead
                        lion. &quot;When you&apos;re ready to go uptown,
                        Frederick,&quot; said he in his gentlest, most patriarchal manner,
                        &quot;let me know. I want to have a little talk with you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman, heavy eyed and listless, looked at the handsome old fraud. As he
                        looked something of the piercing quality and something of the humorous came
                        back into his eyes. &quot;Sit down and say it now,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d prefer to talk where we can be quiet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman rang his bell and when an office boy appeared, said. &quot;No one
                        is to disturb me until I ring again.&quot; Then as the boy withdrew he
                        said to Lockyer: &quot;Now, sir, what is it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lockyer strolled to the window, looked out as if searching for something he
                        failed to find, came back to the chair on the opposite side of the desk from
                        Norman, seated himself. &quot;I don&apos;t know how to
                        begin,&quot; said he. &quot;It is hard to say painful things to
                        anyone I have such an affection for as I have for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman pushed a sheet of letter paper across the desk toward his partner.
                        &quot;Perhaps that will help you,&quot; observed he carelessly.</p>
                    <p>Lockyer put on his nose glasses with the gesture of <pb id="VAA2369-266"
                            n="261"/> grace and intellect that was famous. He reada brief demand for
                        a release from the partnership and a request for an immediate settlement.
                        Lockyer blinked off his glasses with the gesture that was as famous and as
                        admiringly imitated by lesser legal lights as was his gesture of
                        bespectacling himself. &quot;This is most astounding, my boy,&quot;
                        said he. &quot;It is mostmost&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gratifying?&quot; suggested Norman with a sardonic grin.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not in the least, Frederick. The very reversethe exact
                        reverse.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman gave a shrug that said &quot;Why do you persist in those fraudsand
                        with <hi rend="i">me?</hi>&quot; But he did not speak.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; pursued Lockyer, &quot;that you would not
                        have taken this step without conclusive reasons. And I shall not venture the
                        impertinence of prying or of urging.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Norman drily. &quot;Now, as to the terms
                        of settlement.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lockyer, from observation and from gossip, had a pretty shrewd notion of the
                        state of his young partner&apos;s mind, and drew the not unwarranted
                        conclusion that he would be indifferent about termswould be
                        &quot;easy.&quot; With the suavity of Mr. Great-and-Good-Heart he
                        said: &quot;My dear boy, there can&apos;t be any question of money
                        with us. We&apos;ll do the generously fair thingfor, we&apos;re not
                        hucksterers but gentlemen.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-267" n="262"/>
                    <p>&quot;That sounds terrifying,&quot; observed the young man, with a
                        faint ironic smile. &quot;I feel my shirt going and the cold winds
                        whistling about my bare body. To save time, let <hi rend="i">me</hi> state
                        the terms. You want to be rid of me. I want to go. It&apos;s a whim with
                        me. It&apos;s a necessity for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lockyer shifted uneasily at these evidences of unimpaired mentality and
                        undaunted spirit.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here are my terms,&quot; proceeded Norman. &quot;You are to
                        pay me forty thousand a year for five yearsunless I open an office or join
                        another firm. In that case, payments are to cease from the date of my
                        reentering practice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lockyer leaned back and laughed benignantly. &quot;My dear
                        Norman,&quot; he said with a gently remonstrant shake of the head,
                        &quot;those terms are impossible. Forty thousand a year! Why that is
                        within ten thousand of the present share of any of us but you. It is the
                        income of nearly three quarters of a million at six per centof a million at
                        four per cent!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Norman, settling back in his chair.
                        &quot;Then I stand pat.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, my dear Norman, permit me to propose terms that are fair to
                        all&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When I said I stood pat I meant that I would stay on.&quot; His
                        eyes laughed at Lockyer. &quot;I guess we can live without Burroughs and
                        his dependents. Maybe they will find they can&apos;t live without
                        us.&quot; He slowly <pb id="VAA2369-268" n="263"/> leaned forward until,
                        with his forearms against the edge of his desk, he was concentrating a
                        memorable gaze upon Lockyer. &quot;Mr. Lockyer,&quot; said he,
                        &quot;I have been exercising my privilege as a free man to make a damn
                        fool of myself. I shall continue to exercise it so long as I feel disposed
                        that way. But let me tell you something. I can afford to do it. If a
                        man&apos;s asset is money, or character or position or relatives and
                        friends or popular favor or any other perishable article, he must take care
                        how he trifles with it. He may find himself irretrievably ruined. But my
                        asset happens to be none of those things. It is one that can be lost or
                        damaged only by insanity or death. Do you follow me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man looked at him with the sincere and most flattering tribute of
                        compelled admiration. &quot;What a mind you&apos;ve got,
                        Frederickand what courage!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You accept my terms?&quot;</p>
                    <p>If the others agreeand I think they will.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They will,&quot; said Norman.</p>
                    <p>The old man was regarding him with eyes that had genuine anxiety in them.
                        &quot;Why <hi rend="i">do</hi> you do it, Fred?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because I wish to be free,&quot; replied Norman. He would never
                        have told the full truth to that incredulous old cynic of a time-serverthe
                        truth that he was resigning at the dictation of a pride which forbade him to
                        involve others in the ruin he, in his madness, was bent upon.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-269" n="264"/>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t mean, why do you resign,&quot; said Lockyer.
                        &quot;I mean the otherthewoman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman laughed harshly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve seen too much of the world not to
                        understand,&quot; continued Lockyer. &quot;The measureless power of
                        woman over manespeciallypardon me, my dear Normanespecially a bad
                        woman!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The measureless power of a man&apos;s imagination over
                        himself,&quot; rejoined Norman. &quot;Did you ever see or hear of a
                        man without imagination being upset by a woman? It&apos;s in here, Mr.
                        Lockyer&quot;he rapped his forehead&quot;altogether in
                        here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You realize that. Yet you go onand for such apardon me, my boy, for
                        saying itfor such a trifling object.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What does &apos;trifling&apos; mean, sir?&quot; replied
                        the young man. &quot;What is trifling and what is important? It depends
                        upon the point of view. What I wantthat is vital. What I do not wantthat is
                        paltry. It&apos;s my nature to go for what I happen to wantto go for it
                        with all there is in me. I will take nothing elsenothing else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was in his eyes the glitter called insanitythe glitter that reflects
                        the state of mind of any strong man when possessed of one of those fixed
                        ideas that are the idiosyncrasy of the strong. It would have been impossible
                        for Lockyer to be possessed in that way; he had not the courage nor the
                        concentration nor the independence <pb id="VAA2369-270" n="265"/> of soul;
                        like most men, even able men, he dealt only in the conventional. Not in his
                        wildest youth could he have wrecked or injured himself for a woman; women,
                        for him, occupied their conventional place in the scheme of things, and had
                        no allure beyond the conventionally proper and the conventionally
                        improperfor, be it remembered, vice has its beaten track no less than virtue
                        and most of the vicious are as tame and unimaginative as the plodders in the
                        high roads of propriety. Still, Lockyer had associated with strong men, men
                        of boundless desires; thus, he could in a measure sympathize with his young
                        associate. What a pity that these splendid powers should be perverted from
                        the ordinary desires of strong men!</p>
                    <p>Norman rose, to end the interview. &quot;My address is my house. They
                        will forwardif I go away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Lockyer gave him a hearty handclasp, made a few phrases about good wishes and
                        the like, left him alone. The general opinion was that Norman was done for.
                        But Lockyer could not see it. He had seen too many men fall only to rise out
                        of lowest depths to greater heights than they had fallen from. And Norman
                        was only thirty-seven. Perhaps this would prove to be merely a dip in a
                        securely brilliant career and not a fall at all. In that casewith such a
                        brain, such a genius for the lawlessness of the law, what a laughing on the
                        other side of the mouth there might yet be among young Norman&apos;s
                        enemiesand friends!</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-271" n="266"/>
                    <p>He spent most of the next few daysthe lunch time, the late afternoon, finally
                        the early morning hourslurking about the Equitable Building, in which were
                        the offices of Pytchley and Culver. As that building had entrances on four
                        streets, the best he could do was to walk round and round, with an
                        occasional excursion through the corridors and past the elevators. He had
                        written her, asking to see her; he had got no answer. He ceased to wait at
                        the elevators after he had twice narrowly escaped being seen by Tetlow. He
                        was indifferent to Tetlow, except as meeting him might make it harder to see
                        Dorothy. He drank hard. But drink never affected him except to make him more
                        grimly tenacious in whatever he had deliberately and soberly resolved. Drink
                        did not explainneither wholly nor in any partthis conduct of his. It, and
                        the more erratic vagaries to follow, will seem incredible conduct for a man
                        of Norman&apos;s character and position to feeble folk with their feeble
                        desires, their dread of criticism and ridicule, their exaggerated and
                        adoring notions of the master men. In fact, it was the natural outcome of
                        the man&apos;s naturearrogant, contemptuous of his fellowmen and of
                        their opinions, and, like all the master men, capable of such concentration
                        upon a desire that he would adopt any means, high or low, dignified or the
                        reverse, if only it promised to further his end. Fred Norman, at these
                        vulgar vigils, took the measure of his own self-abasement to a
                        hair&apos;s breadth. But he kept on, with the fever of <pb
                            id="VAA2369-272" n="267"/> his infatuation burning like a delirium,
                        burning higher and deeper with each baffled day.</p>
                    <p>At noon, one day, as he swung into Broadway from Cedar street, he ran
                        straight into Tetlow. It was raining and his umbrella caught in
                        Tetlow&apos;s. It was a ludicrous situation, but there was no answering
                        smile in his former friend&apos;s eyes. Tetlow glowered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve heard you were hanging about,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;How low you have sunk!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman laughed in his face. &quot;Poor Tetlow,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;I never expected to see you develop into a crusader. And what a
                        Don Quixote you look. Cheer up, old man. Don&apos;t take it so
                        hard.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I warn you to keep away from her,&quot; said Tetlow in subdued,
                        tense tones, his fat face quivering with emotion. &quot;Hasn&apos;t
                        she shown you plainly that she&apos;ll have nothing to do with
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want only five minutes&apos; talk with her, Tetlow,&quot;
                        said Norman, dropping into an almost pleading tone. &quot;And I
                        guarantee I&apos;ll say nothing you wouldn&apos;t approve, if you
                        heard. You are advising her badly. You are doing her an injury.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am protecting her from a scoundrel,&quot; retorted Tetlow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;ll not thank you for it, when she finds out the
                        truth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can write to her. What a shallow liar you are!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-273" n="268"/>
                    <p>&quot;I cannot write what I must say,&quot; said Norman. It had never
                        been difficult for him, however provoked, to keep his temperoutwardly.
                        Tetlow&apos;s insults were to him no more than the barkings of a watch
                        dog, and one not at all dangerous, but only amusing. &quot;I must see
                        her. If you are her friend, and not merely a jealous, disappointed lover,
                        you&apos;ll advise her to see me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You shall not see her, if I can help it,&quot; cried his former
                        friend. &quot;And if you persist in annoying her&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t make futile threats, Tetlow,&quot; Norman
                        interrupted. &quot;You&apos;ve done me all the mischief you can do.
                        I see you hate me for the injuries you&apos;ve done me. That&apos;s
                        the way it always is. But I don&apos;t hate you. It was at my suggestion
                        that the Lockyer firm is trying to get you back as a partner.&quot;
                        Then, as Tetlow colored &quot;Oh, I see you&apos;re accepting their
                        offer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I had thought&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nonsense. You&apos;re not a fool. How does it matter whose the
                        hand, if only it&apos;s a helping hand? And you may be sure
                        they&apos;d never have made you the offer if they didn&apos;t need
                        you badly. All the credit I claim is having the intelligence to enlighten
                        their stupidity with the right suggestion.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In spite of himself Tetlow was falling under the spell of Norman&apos;s
                        personality, of the old and deep admiration the lesser man had for the
                        greater.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Norman,&quot; he said, &quot;how can you be such a
                        combination <pb id="VAA2369-274" n="269"/> of bigness and petty deviltry?
                        You are a monster of self-indulgence. It&apos;s a God&apos;s mercy
                        there aren&apos;t more men with your selfishness and your
                        desires.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman laughed sardonically. &quot;The difference between me and most
                        men,&quot; said he, &quot;isn&apos;t in selfishness or in
                        desires, but in courage. Courage, Billythere&apos;s what most of you
                        lack. And even in courage I&apos;m not alone. My sort fill most of the
                        high places.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow looked dismal confession of a fear that Norman was right.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; pursued Norman, &quot;in this country there are
                        enough wolves to attend to pretty nearly all the sheepthough it&apos;s
                        amazing how much mutton there is.&quot; With an abrupt shift from
                        raillery, &quot;You&apos;ll help me with her, Billy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you let her alone, Fred?&quot; pleaded
                        Tetlow. &quot;It isn&apos;t worthy of youa big man like you. Let her
                        alone, Fred!the poor child, trying to earn her own living in an honest way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let her alone? Tetlow, I shall never let her alone as long as she
                        and I are both alive.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The fat man, with his premature wrinkles and his solemn air of law books that
                        look venerable though fresh from the press, took on an added pastiness.
                        &quot;Fredfor God&apos;s sake, can&apos;t you love her in a
                        noble waya way worthy of you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman gave him a penetrating glance. &quot;Is lovesuch love as mine<hi
                            rend="i">and</hi> yours&quot; There Tetlow flushed <pb
                            id="VAA2369-275" n="270"/> guiltily&quot;is it ever noble?whatever
                        that means. No, it&apos;s humanhuman. But I&apos;m not trying to
                        harm her. I give you my word... Will you help meand her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow hesitated. His heavy cheeks quivered. &quot;I don&apos;t trust
                        you,&quot; he cried violentlythe violence of a man fighting against an
                        enemy within. &quot;Don&apos;t ever speak to me again.&quot; And
                        he rushed away through the rain, knocking umbrellas this way and that.</p>
                    <p>About noon two days later, as Norman was making one of his excursions past
                        the Equitable elevators, he saw Bob Culver at the news stand. It so happened
                        that as he recognized Culver, Culver cast in the direction of the elevators
                        the sort of look that betrays a man waiting for a woman. Unseen by Culver,
                        Norman stopped short. Into his face blazed the fury of suspicion, jealousy,
                        and hateone of the cyclones of passion that swept him from time to time and
                        revealed to his own appalled self the full intensity of his feeling, the
                        full power of the demon that possessed him. Culver was of those glossy,
                        black men who are beloved of women. He was much handsomer than Norman, who,
                        indeed, was not handsome at all, but was regarded as handsome because he had
                        the air of great distinction. Many times these two young men had been pitted
                        against each other in legal battles. Every time Norman had won. Twice they
                        had contended for the favor of the same lady. Each had scored once. But as
                        Culver&apos;s victory was merely for a very light and empty-headed lady
                        of the stage while he <pb id="VAA2369-276" n="271"/> had won Josephine
                        Burroughs away from Culver, the balance was certainly not against him.</p>
                    <p>As Norman slipped back and into the cross corridor to avoid meeting Culver,
                        Dorothy Hallowell hurried from a just descended elevator and, with a quick,
                        frightened glance toward Culver, in profile, almost ran toward Norman. It
                        was evident that she had only one thought to escape being seen by her new
                        employer. When she realized that some one was standing before her and moved
                        to one side to pass, she looked up. &quot;Oh!&quot; she gasped,
                        starting back. And then she stood there white and shaking.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that beast Culver hounding you?&quot; demanded Norman.</p>
                    <p>She recovered herself quickly. With flashing eyes, she cried: &quot;How
                        dare you! How dare you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman, possessed by his rage against Culver, paid no attention. &quot;If
                        he don&apos;t let you alone,&quot; he said, &quot;I&apos;ll
                        thrash him into a hospital for six months. You must leave his office at
                        once. You&apos;ll not go back there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must be crazy,&quot; replied she, calm again.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve no complaint to make of the way I&apos;m being
                        treated. I never was so well off in my life. And Mr. Culver is very kind and
                        polite.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know what that means,&quot; said Norman harshly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everyone isn&apos;t like you,&quot; retorted she.</p>
                    <p>He was examining her from head to foot, as if to make sure that it was she
                        with no charm missing. He <pb id="VAA2369-277" n="272"/> noted that she was
                        much less poorly dressed than when she worked for his firm. In those days
                        she often looked dowdy, showed plainly the girl who has to make a hasty
                        toilet in a small bedroom, with tiny wash-stand and looking-glass, in the
                        early, coldest hours of a cold morning. Now she looked well taken care of
                        physically, not so well, not anything like so well as the women uptown the
                        ladies with nothing to do but make toilettes; still, unusually well looked
                        after for a working girl. At first glance after those famished and ravening
                        days of longing for her and seeking her, she before him in rather dim
                        reality of the obvious office-girl, seemed disappointing. It could not be
                        that this insignificance was the cause of all his fever and turmoil. He
                        began to hope that he was recovering, that the cloud of insane desire was
                        clearing from his sky. But a second glance killed that hope. For, once more
                        he saw he mystery, her beauties that revealed their perfection and splendor
                        only to the observant.</p>
                    <p>While he looked she was regaining her balance, as the fading color in her
                        white skin and the subsidence of the excitement in her eyes evidenced.
                        &quot;Let me pass, please,&quot; she said coldlyfor, she was against
                        the wall with him standing before her in such a way that she could not go
                        until he moved aside.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll lunch together,&quot; he said. &quot;I want
                        to talk with you. Did that well-meaning assTetlowtell you?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-278" n="273"/>
                    <p>&quot;There is nothing you can say that I wish to hear,&quot; was her
                        quiet reply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your eyesthe edges of the lids are red. You have been
                        crying?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She lifted her glance to his and he had the sense of a veil drawing aside to
                        reveal a desolation. &quot;For my father,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>His face flushed. He looked steadily at her. &quot;Now that he is gone,
                        you have no one to protect you. I am&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I need no one,&quot; said she with a faintly contemptuous
                        smile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You do need some oneand I am going to undertake it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her face lighted up. He thought it was because of what he had said. But she
                        immediately undeceived him. She said in a tone of delighted relief,
                        &quot;Here comes Mr. Tetlow. You must excuse me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dorothylisten!&quot; he cried. &quot;We are going to be
                        married at once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The words exploded dizzily in his ears. He assumed they would have a far more
                        powerful effect upon her. But her expression did not change.
                        &quot;No,&quot; she said hastily. &quot;I must go with Mr.
                        Tetlow.&quot; Tetlow was now at hand, his heavy face almost formidable
                        in its dark ferocity. She said to him: &quot;I was waiting for you. Come
                        on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman turned eagerly to his former friend. He <pb id="VAA2369-279" n="274"/>
                        said: &quot;Tetlow, I have just asked Miss Hallowell to be my
                        wife.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow stared. Then pain and despair seemed to flood and ravage his whole
                        body.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I told you the other day,&quot; Norman went on, &quot;that
                        I was ready to do the fair thing. I have just been saying to Miss Hallowell
                        that she must have some one to protect her. You agree with me,
                        don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow, fumbling vaguely with his watch chain, gazed straight ahead.
                        &quot;Yes,&quot; he said with an effort. &quot;Yes, you are
                        right, Norman. An office is no place for an attractive girl as young as she
                        is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Has Culver been annoying her?&quot; inquired Norman.</p>
                    <p>Tetlow started. &quot;Ahshe&apos;s told youhas she? I rather hoped
                        she hadn&apos;t noticed or understood.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Both men now looked at the girl. She had shrunk into herself until she was
                        almost as dim and unimpressive, as cipher-like as when Norman first beheld
                        her. Also she seemed at least five years less than her twenty.
                        &quot;Dorothy,&quot; said Norman, &quot;you will let me take
                        care of youwon&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she saidand the word carried all the quiet force she
                        was somehow able to put into her short, direct answers.</p>
                    <p>Tetlow&apos;s pasty sallowness took on a dark red tinge. He looked at her
                        in surprise. &quot;You don&apos;t understand, Miss
                        Dorothy,&quot; he said. &quot;He wants to marry you.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-280" n="275"/>
                    <p>&quot;I understand perfectly,&quot; replied she, with the faraway
                        look in her blue eyes. &quot;But I&apos;ll not marry him. I despise
                        him. He frightens me. He sickens me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman clinched his hands and the muscles of his jaw in the effort to control
                        himself. &quot;Dorothy,&quot; he said, &quot;I&apos;ve not
                        acted as I should. Tetlow will tell you that there is good excuse for me. I
                        know you don&apos;t understand about those thingsabout the ways of the
                        world&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I understand perfectly,&quot; she interrupted.
                        &quot;It&apos;s you that don&apos;t understand. I never saw
                        anyone so conceited. Haven&apos;t I told you I don&apos;t love you,
                        and don&apos;t want anything to do with you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow, lover though he wasor perhaps because he was lover, of the hopeless
                        kind that loves generouslycould not refrain from protest. The girl was
                        flinging away a dazzling future. It wasn&apos;t fair to her to let her
                        do it when if she appreciated she would be overwhelmed with joy and
                        gratitude. &quot;I believe you ought to listen to Norman, Miss
                        Dorothy,&quot; he said pleadingly. &quot;At any rate, think it
                        overdon&apos;t answer right away. He is making you an honorable
                        proposalone that&apos;s advantageous in every way&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dorothy regarded him with innocent eyes, wide and wondering. &quot;I
                        didn&apos;t think you could talk like that, Mr. Tetlow!&quot; she
                        exclaimed. &quot;You heard what I said to himabout the way I felt. How
                        could I be his wife? He tried everything elseand, now, though he&apos;s
                        ashamed <pb id="VAA2369-281" n="[276]"/> of it, he&apos;s trying to get
                        me by marriage. Oh, I understand. I wish I didn&apos;t. I&apos;d not
                        feel so low.&quot; She looked at Norman. &quot;Can&apos;t you
                        realize <hi rend="i">ever</hi> that I don&apos;t want any of the grand
                        things you&apos;re so crazy aboutthat I want something very
                        differentsomething <hi rend="i">you</hi> could never give meor get for
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t there anything I can do, Dorothy, to make you forget
                        and forgive?&quot; he cried, like a boy, an infatuated boy.
                        &quot;For God&apos;s sake, Tetlow, help me! Tell her I&apos;m
                        not so rotten as she thinks. I&apos;ll be anything you like, my
                            darling<hi rend="i">anything</hi>if only you&apos;ll take me. For I
                        must have you. You&apos;re the only thing in the world I care forand,
                        without you, I&apos;ve no interest in lifenonenone!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was so impassioned that passersby began to observe them curiously. Tetlow
                        became uneasy. But Norman and Dorothy were unconscious of what was going on
                        around them. The energy of his passion compelled her, though the passion
                        itself was unwelcome. &quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; she said
                        gently. &quot;Though you would have hurt me, if you could, I
                        don&apos;t want to hurt you.... I&apos;m sorry. I can&apos;t
                        love you.... I&apos;m sorry. Come on, Mr. Tetlow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman stood aside. She and Tetlow went on out of the building. He remained
                        in the same place, oblivious of the crowd streaming by, each man or woman
                        with a glance at his vacant stare.</p>

                    <head>XIV</head>
                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HAN</hi> Fred Norman no man ever had better reason to feel
                        securely entrenched upon the heights of success. It was no silly vaunt of
                        optimism for him to tell Lock-yer that only loss of life or loss of mind
                        could dislodge him. And a few days after Dorothy had extinguished the last
                        spark of hope he got ready to pull himself together and show the world that
                        it was indulging too soon in its hypocritical headshakings over his ruin.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am going to open an office of my own at once,&quot; he said
                        to his sister.</p>
                    <p>She did not wish to discourage him, but she could not altogether keep her
                        thoughts from her face. She had, in a general way, a clear idea of the
                        complete system of tollgates, duly equipped with strong barriers, which the
                        mighty few have established across practically all the highroads to material
                        success. Also, she felt in her brother&apos;s manner and tone a certain
                        profound discouragement, a lack of the unconquerable spirit which had
                        carried him so far so speedily. It is not a baseless notion that the man who
                        has never been beaten is often destroyed by his first reverse. Ursula feared
                        the spell of success had been broken for him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-283" n="278"/>
                    <p>&quot;You mean,&quot; she suggested, with apparent carelessness,
                        &quot;that you will give up your forty thousand a year?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He made a disdainful gesture. &quot;I can make more than that,&quot;
                        said he. &quot;It&apos;s a second rate lawyer who can&apos;t in
                        this day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course you can,&quot; replied she tactfully.&quot; But
                        why not take a rest first? Then there&apos;s old Burroughson the war
                        path. - Wouldn&apos;t it be wise to wait till he calms down?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If Burroughs or any other man is necessary to me,&quot;
                        rejoined Fred, &quot;the sooner I find it out the better. I ought to
                        know just where II myselfstand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No one is necessary to you but yourself,&quot; said Ursula,
                        proudly and sincerely. &quot;But, Fred Are you yourself just
                        now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I&apos;m not,&quot; admitted he. &quot;But the way
                        to become so again isn&apos;t by waiting but by working.&quot; An
                        expression of sheer wretchedness came into his listless, heavy eyes.
                        &quot;Urse, I&apos;ve got to conquer my weakness now, or go
                        under.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was eager to hold on to the secure forty thousand a yearfor his sake no
                        less than for her own. She argued with him with all the adroitness of a mind
                        as good in its way as his own. But she could not shake his resolution. And
                        she in prudence, desisted when he said bitterly: &quot;I see
                        you&apos;ve lost confidence in me. Well, I don&apos;t blame you....
                        So have I.&quot; Then after <pb id="VAA2369-284" n="279"/> a moment,
                        violently rather than strongly: &quot;But I&apos;ve got to get it
                        back. If I don&apos;t I&apos;m only putting off the smasha complete
                        smash.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see quite how it&apos;s to be
                        arranged,&quot; said she, red and hesitating. For, she feared he would
                        think her altogether selfish in her anxiety. He certainly would have been
                        justified in so thinking; he knew how rarely generosity survived in the
                        woman who leads the soft and idle life.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How long can we keep on as we&apos;re living nowif
                        there&apos;s nothing, or little, coming in?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; confessed she. She was as poor at
                        finance as he, and had certainly not been improved by his habit of giving
                        her whatever she happened to think was necessary. &quot;I can&apos;t
                        say. Perhaps a few monthsI don&apos;t know Not long, I&apos;m
                        afraid.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Six months?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no. You seethe fact isI&apos;ve been rather careless about
                        the bills. You&apos;re so generous, Fredand one is so busy in New York.
                        I guess we owe a good dealhere and there and yonder. Andthe last few days
                        some of the tradespeople have been pressing for payment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You see!&quot; exclaimed he. &quot;The report is going
                        round that I&apos;m ruined and done for. I&apos;ve simply got to
                        make good. If you can&apos;t keep up a front, shut up the house and go
                        abroad. You can stay till I&apos;ve got my foot back on its
                        neck.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-285" n="280"/>
                    <p>She believed in him, at bottom. She could not conceive how appearances and
                        her forebodings could be true. Such strength as his could not be overwhelmed
                        thus suddenly. And by so slight a thing!by an unsatisfied passion for a
                        woman, and an insignificant woman, at that. For, like all women, like all
                        the world for that matter, she measured a passion by the woman who was the
                        object of it, instead of by the man who fabricated it.
                        &quot;YesI&apos;ll go abroad,&quot; said she, hopefully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Quietly arrange for a long stay,&quot; he advised. &quot;I
                            <hi rend="i">hope</hi> it won&apos;t be long. But I never plan on
                        hope.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Thus, with his sister and Fitzhugh out of the way and the heaviest of his
                        burdens of expense greatly lightened, he set about rehabitating himself. He
                        took an office, waited for clients. And clients cameexcellent clients. Came
                        and precipitately left him.</p>
                    <p>There were two reasons for it. The firstthe one most often heardwas the story
                        going round that he had been, and probably still was, out of his mind. No
                        deadlier or crueler weapon can be used against a man than that same charge
                        as to his sanity. It has been known to destroy, or seriously maim, brilliant
                        and able men with no trace of any of the untrustworthy kinds of insanity.
                        Where the man&apos;s own conduct gives color to the report, the attack
                        is usually mortal. And Norman had acted the crazy man. The second reason was
                        the hostility of Burroughs, reinforced by all the hatreds <pb
                            id="VAA2369-286" n="281"/> and jealousies Norman&apos;s not too
                        respectful way of dealing with his fellow men had been creating through
                        fifteen years.</p>
                    <p>The worst moment in the life of a man who has always proudly regarded himself
                        as above any need whatever from his fellow men is when he discovers all in a
                        flash, that the timid animal he spurned as it fawned has him upon his back,
                        has its teeth and claws at his helpless throat.</p>
                    <p>For four months he stood out against the isolation, the suspicion as to his
                        sanity, the patronizing pity of men who but a little while before had felt
                        honored when he spoke to them. For four months he gave battle to unseen and
                        silent foes compassing him on every side. He had no spirit for the fight;
                        his love of Dorothy Hallowell and his complete rout there had taken the
                        spirit out of himand with it had gone that confidence in himself and in his
                        luck which had won him so many critical battles. Then He had been keeping up
                        a large suite of offices, a staff of clerks and stenographers and all the
                        paraphernalia of the great and successful lawyer. He had been spreading out
                        the little business he got in a not unsuccessful effort to make it appear
                        big and growing. He now gave up these offices and the costly pride, pomp and
                        circumstanceleft with several thousand dollars owing. He took two small
                        rooms in a building tenanted by beginners and cheap shysters. He continued
                        to live at his club, where even the servants <pb id="VAA2369-287" n="282"/>
                        were subtly insolent to him; he could see the time approaching when he might
                        have to let himself be dropped for failing to pay dues and bills.</p>
                    <p>He stared at his ruin in stupid and dazed amazement. Usually, to hear or to
                        read about such a catastrophe as this is to get a vague, rather impressive
                        notion of something picturesque and romantic. Ruined, like all the big
                        fateful words, has a dignified sound. But the historians and novelists and
                        poets and other keepers of human records have a pleasant, but not very
                        honest way, of omitting practically all the essentials from their records
                        and substituting glittering imaginings that delight the readerand wofully
                        mislead him as to the truth about life. What wonder that we learn slowlyand
                        improve slowly. How wofully we have been, and are, misled by all upon whom
                        we have relied as teachers.</p>
                    <p>Already one of these charming tales of majestic downfall was in process of
                        manufacture, with Frederick Norman as the central figure. It was only
                        awaiting his suicide or some other mode of complete submergence for its
                        final glose of glamor. In this manufacture, the truth, as usual, had been
                        almost omitted; such truth as was retained for this artistic version of a
                        human happening was so perverted that it was falser than the simon pure
                        fictions with which it was interwoven. Just as the literal truth about his
                        success was far from being altogether to his credit, so the literal truth as
                        to his fall <pb id="VAA2369-288" n="283"/> gave him little of the vesture of
                        the hero, and that little ill fitting, to cover his naked humanness. Let him
                        who has risen to material success altogether by methods approved by the
                        idealists, let him who has fallen from on high with graceful majesty,
                        without hysterical clutchings and desperate attempts at selfsalvation in
                        disregard of the safety of otherslet either of these superhuman beings come
                        forward with the first stone for Norman.</p>
                    <p>Those at some distance from the falling man could afford to be romantic and
                        piteous over his fate. Those in his dangerous neighborhood were too busy
                        getting out of the way. &quot;Man fallingstand from under!&quot; was
                        the cryhow familiar it is!and acquaintances and friends fled in mad
                        skedaddle. He would surely be asking favorswould be trying to borrow money.
                        It is no peculiarity of rats to desert a sinking ship; it is simply an
                        inevitable precaution in a social system modeled as yet upon
                        nature&apos;s cruel law of the survival of the fittest. A falling man is
                        first of all a warning to all other men high enough up to be able to falla
                        warning to them to take care lest they fall also where footing is so
                        insecure and precipices and steeps beset every path.</p>
                    <p>Norman, falling, falling, gazed round him and up and down, in dazed wonder.
                        He had seen many others fall. He had seen just where and just why they
                        missed their footing. And he had been confident that with him <pb
                            id="VAA2369-289" n="284"/> no such misstep was possible. He could not
                        believe; a little while, and luck would turn, and up he would go againhigher
                        than before. Many a lawyerto look no farther than his own professionhad
                        through recklessness or pride or inadvertence got the big men down on him.
                        But after a time they had relented or had found an exact use for him; and
                        fall had been succeeded by rise. Was there a single instance where a man of
                        good brain had been permanently downed? No, not one. Stay Some of these
                        unfortunates had failed to reappear on the heights of success. Yes, thinking
                        of the matter, he recalled several such. Had he been altogether right in
                        assuming, in his days of confidence and success, that they stayed down
                        because they belonged down? Perhaps he had judged them harshly? Yes, he was
                        sure he had judged them harshly. There was such a thing as breaking a proud
                        spiritand he found within himself apparent proof that precisely this
                        calamity had befallen him.</p>
                    <p>There came a timeand it came soonwhen he had about exhausted his desperate
                        ingenuity at cornering acquaintances and former friends and
                        &quot;sticking them up&quot; for loans of five hundred, a hundred,
                        fifty, twenty-five Because these vulgar and repulsive facts are not found in
                        the usual records of the men who have dropped and come up again, do not
                        imagine that only the hopeless and never-reappearing failures pass through
                        such experiences. On the contrary, they are part of the <pb id="VAA2369-290"
                            n="285"/> common human lot, and few indeed are the men who have not had
                        themand worseif they could but be brought to tell the truth. Destiny rarely
                        permits any one of us to go from cradle to grave without doing many a thing
                        shameful and universally condemned. How could it be otherwise under our
                        social system? When Norman was about at the end of all his resources Tetlow
                        called on himTetlow, now a partner in the Lockyer firm.</p>
                    <p>He came with an air of stealth. &quot;I don&apos;t want anyone to
                        know I&apos;m doing this,&quot; said he frankly. &quot;If it got
                        out, I&apos;d be damaged and you&apos;d not profit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Rarely does anyone, however unworthy and Fred Norman was far from unworthy,
                        as we humans gorarely does anyone find himself absolutely without a friend.
                        There is a saying that no man ever sunk so low, ever became so vile and
                        squalid in soul and body, but that if he were dying, and the fact were
                        noised throughout the world, some woman somewhere would comeperhaps from a
                        sense of duty, perhaps from love, perhaps for the sake of a moment of
                        happiness long past but never equaled, and so never forgottenbut from
                        whatever motive, she would come. In the same manner, anyone in dire straits
                        can be sure of some friend. There were several others whom Norman had been
                        expectingmen he had saved by his legal ingenuity at turning points in their
                        careers. None of these was so imprudent as uselessly to involve himself. <pb
                            id="VAA2369-291" n="286"/> It was Tetlow who cameTetlow, with whom his
                        accounts were more than balanced, with the balance against him. Tetlow, whom
                        he did not expect.</p>
                    <p>Norman did not welcome him effusively. He said at once: &quot;How
                        isshe?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow shifted uneasily. &quot;I don&apos;t know. She&apos;s not
                        with us. I gave her a place thereto get her away from Culver. But she
                        didn&apos;t stay long. No doubt she&apos;s doing well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought you cared about her,&quot; said Norman, who in
                        estimating Tetlow&apos;s passion had measured it by his own, had
                        neglected to consider that the desires of most men soon grow short of breath
                        and weary of leg.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesso I did care for her,&quot; said Tetlow, in the voice of a
                        man who has been ill but is now well. &quot;But that&apos;s all
                        over. Women aren&apos;t worth bothering about much. They&apos;re
                        largely vanity. The way they soon take a man for granted if he&apos;s at
                        all kind to them discourages any but the poorest sort of fool. At least
                        that&apos;s my opinion.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then you don&apos;t come from her?&quot; said Norman with
                        complete loss of interest in his caller.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. I&apos;ve come Fred, I hear you&apos;re in
                        difficulties.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman&apos;s now deep-set eyes gleamed humorously in his haggard and
                        failed-looking face. &quot;<hi rend="i">In</hi> difficulties? Not at
                        all. I&apos;m <hi rend="i">under</hi> themdrowned forty fathoms
                        deep.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-292" n="287"/>
                    <p>&quot;Then you&apos;ll not resent my coming straight to the point and
                        asking if I can help you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s a rash offer, Tetlow. I never suspected rashness
                        was one of your qualities.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t mean to offer you a loan or anything of that
                        sort,&quot; pursued Tetlow. &quot;There&apos;s only one thing
                        that can help a man in your position. He must either be saved outright or
                        left to drown. I&apos;ve come with something that may save
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was so much of the incongruous in a situation where <hi rend="i"
                        >he</hi> was listening to an offer of salvation from such a man as Billy
                        Tetlow that Norman smiled. &quot;Well, what is it?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s a chance that within six months or soperhaps
                        soonerBurroughs and Galloway may end their truce and declare war on each
                        other. If so, Galloway will win. Anyhow, the Galloway connection would be
                        better than the Burroughs connection.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman looked at Tetlow shrewdly. &quot;How do you know this?&quot;
                        he asked.</p>
                    <p>Tetlow&apos;s eyes shifted. &quot;Can&apos;t tell you. But I
                        know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Galloway hates me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow nodded. &quot;You were the one who forced him into a position
                        where he had to make peace with Burroughs. But Galloway&apos;s a big
                        man, big enough to admire ability wherever he sees it. He has admired you
                        ever since.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-293" n="288"/>
                    <p>&quot;And has given his business to another firm.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But if the break comes he&apos;ll need you. And he&apos;s
                        the sort of man who doesn&apos;t hesitate to take what he
                        needs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Too remote,&quot; said Norman, and his despondent gesture
                        showed how quickly hope had lighted up. &quot;Besides, Billy,
                        I&apos;ve lost my nerve. I&apos;m no good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you&apos;ve gotten over thatthat attack of
                        insanity.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman shook his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t understand it,&quot; ejaculated Tetlow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course you can&apos;t,&quot; said Norman.
                        &quot;Butthere it is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You haven&apos;t seen her lately?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not since that day ... Billy, she hasn&apos;t&quot; Norman
                        stopped, and Tetlow saw that his hands were trembling with agitation, and
                        marveled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; replied Tetlow. &quot;So far as I know,
                        she&apos;s still respectable. Butwhy don&apos;t you go to see her? I
                        think you&apos;d be cured.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why do you say that?&quot; demanded Norman, the veins in his
                        forehead bulging with the fury he was ready to release.</p>
                    <p>&quot;For no especial reasonon my honor, Fred,&quot; replied Tetlow.
                        &quot;Simply because time works wonders in all sorts of ways, including
                        infatuations. Alsowell, the fact is, it didn&apos;t seem to me that
                        young lady improved on acquaintance. Maybe I got tired, or <pb
                            id="VAA2369-294" n="289"/> piquedI don&apos;t know. If she
                        hadn&apos;t been a silly little fool, would she have refused you? I know
                        it sounds wellin a novel or a playfor a poor girl to refuse a good offer,
                        just from sentiment. But, all the same, only a fool girl does itin lifeeh?
                        But go to see her. You&apos;ll understand what I mean, I think. I want
                        you to brace up. That may help.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s she doing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know. I&apos;ll send you her address. I can
                        get it. About Galloway If that break comes, I propose that we get his
                        businessyou and I. I want you for a partner. I always did. I think I know
                        how to get work out of you. I understand you better than anyone else.
                        That&apos;s why I&apos;m here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s useless,&quot; said Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m willing to take the risk. Now, here&apos;s what I
                        propose. I&apos;ll stake you to the extent of a thousand dollars a month
                        for the next six months, you to keep on as you are and not to tie yourself
                        up to any other lawyer, or to any client likely to hamper us if we get the
                        Galloway business.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve been borrowing right and left&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know about that,&quot; interrupted Tetlow.
                        &quot;I&apos;m not interested. If you&apos;ll agree to my
                        proposal, I&apos;ll take my chances.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are throwing away six thousand dollars.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I owe you a position where I make five times that much.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-295" n="290"/>
                    <p>Norman shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Very well. Can I have five hundred
                        at once?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll send you a check to-day. I&apos;ll send two
                        checks a monththe first and the fifteenth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am drinking a great deal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You always did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not until recently. I never knew what drinking meant until these
                        last few months.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, do as you like with the money. Drink it all, if you please.
                        I&apos;m making no conditions beyond the two I stated.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will send me that address?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In the letter with the check.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will she see me, do you think?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t an idea,&quot; replied Tetlow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the mystery?&quot; asked Norman. &quot;Why
                        do you speak of her so indifferently?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s the way I feel.&quot; Then, in answer to the
                        unspoken suspicion once more appearing in Norman&apos;s eyes, he added:
                        &quot;She&apos;s a very nice, sweet girl, Normanso far as I know or
                        believe. Beyond that Go to see her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It had been many a week since Norman had heard a friendly voice. The very
                        sound of the human voice had become hateful to him, because he was
                        constantly detecting the note of nervousness, the scarcely concealed fear of
                        being entangled in his misfortunes. As Tetlow rose to go, Norman tried to
                        detain him. The sound of <pb id="VAA2369-296" n="291"/> an unconstrained
                        voice, the sight of a believing face that did not express one or more of the
                        shadings of contempt between pity and aversionthe sight and sound of this
                        friend Tetlow was acting upon him like one of those secret, unexpected,
                        powerful tonics which nature at times suddenly injects into a dying man to
                        confound the doctors and cheat death.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tetlow,&quot; said he, &quot;I&apos;m downprobably down
                        for good. But if I ever get up again, I&apos;ll not make one mistakethe
                        one that cost me this fall. Do you know what that mistake was?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose you mean Miss Hallowell?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Norman, to his surprise. &quot;I mean my
                        lack of money, of capital, of a large and secure income. I used to imagine
                        that brains were the best, the only sure asset. I was guilty of the
                        stupidity of overvaluing my own possessions.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Brains are a mighty good asset, Fred.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesand necessary. But a man of action must have under his brains
                        another asset<hi rend="i">must</hi> have it, Billy. The one secure asset is
                        a big capital. Money rules this world. Some men have been lucky enough to
                        rise and stay risen, without money. But not a man of all the men who have
                        been knocked out could have been dislodged if he had been armed and armored
                        with money. My prodigality was my fatal mistake. I shan&apos;t make it
                        againif I get the chance. You don&apos;t know, Tetlow, how hard it is to
                        get money when you are <pb id="VAA2369-297" n="[292]"/> tumbling and must
                        have it. I never dreamed what a factor it is in calamities of <hi rend="i"
                            >every</hi> sort. It&apos;s <hi rend="i">the</hi> factor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t like to hear you talk that way, Norman,&quot;
                        said Tetlow earnestly. &quot;I&apos;ve always most admired in you
                        the fact that you weren&apos;t mercenary.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I never shall be,&quot; said Norman, with the patient smile
                        of a swift, keen mind at one that is slow and hard to make understand.
                        &quot;It isn&apos;t my nature. But, if I&apos;m resurrected,
                        I&apos;ll seem to be mercenary until I get a full suit of the only armor
                        that&apos;s invulnerable in this world. Why, I built my fort like a
                        fool. It was impregnable except for one thingone obvious thing. It
                        hadn&apos;t a supply of water. If I build again it&apos;ll be round
                        a springan income big enough for my needs and beyond anybody&apos;s
                        power to cut off.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow showed that he was much cheered by Norman&apos;s revived interest
                        in life. But he went away uneasy; for the last thing Norman said to him was:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t forget that address!&quot;</p>

                    <p>B<hi rend="sc">UT</hi> it chanced that Norman met her in the street about an
                        hour after Tetlow&apos;s call.</p>
                    <p>He was on the way to lunch at the Lawyer&apos;s Clubone of those apparent
                        luxuries that are the dire and pitiful necessities of men in New York
                        fighting to maintain the semblance and the reputation of prosperity. It must
                        not be imagined by those who are here let into Norman&apos;s inmost
                        secrets that his appearance betrayed the depth to which he had fallen. At
                        least to the casual eye he seemed the same rich and powerful personage. An
                        expert might have got at a good part of the truth from his somber eyes and
                        haggard face, from the subtle transformation of the former look of serene
                        pride into the bravado of pretense. And as, in a general way, the facts of
                        his fall were known far and wide, all his acquaintances understood that his
                        seeming of undiminished success was simply the familiar
                        &quot;bluff.&quot; Its advantage to him with them lay in its raising
                        a doubt as to just what degree of disaster it hidno small advantage. Nor was
                        this &quot;bluff&quot; altogether for the benefit of the outside
                        world. It made his fall less hideously intolerable to himself. In the bottom
                        of his heart he <pb id="VAA2369-299" n="294"/> knew that when drink and no
                        money should finally force him to release his relaxing hold upon his
                        fashionable clubs, upon luxurious attire and habits, he would suddenly and
                        with accelerated speed drop into the abyssWe have all caught glimpses of
                        that abyssfrayed fine linen cheaply laundered, a tie of one time smartness
                        showing signs of too long wear, a suit from the best kind of tailor with
                        shiny spot glistening here, patch peeping there, a queer unkemptness about
                        the hair and skinthese the beginnings of a road that leads straight and
                        short to the barrel-house, the park bench, and the police station. Because,
                        when a man strikes into that stretch of the road to perdition, he ceases to
                        be one of our friends, passes from view entirely, we have the habit of <hi

                        the sort of drop Norman was taking. We remember when he was making a bluff
                        such as Norman was making in those days; but we think now that we were
                        mistaken in having suspected it of being bluff.</p>
                    <p>Norman, dressed with more than ordinary carehow sensitive a man becomes about
                        those things when there is neither rustle nor jingle in his pockets, and his
                        smallest check would be returned with the big black stamp &quot;No
                        Funds&quot; Norman, groomed to the last button, was in Broadway near
                        Rector Street. Ahead of him he saw the figure of a girla trim, attractive
                        figure, slim and charmingly long of line. A second <pb id="VAA2369-300"
                            n="295"/> glance, and he recognized her. What was the change that had
                        prevented his recognizing her at once? He had not seen that particular
                        lightish-blue dress beforenor the coquettish harmonizing hat. But that was
                        not the reason. No, it was the coquetry in her toiletthe effort of the girl
                        to draw attention to her charms by such small devices as are within the
                        reach of extremely modest means. He did not like this change. It offended
                        his taste; it alarmed his jealousy.</p>
                    <p>He quickened his step, and when almost at her side spoke her
                        name&quot;Miss Hallowell.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She stopped, turned. As soon as she recognized him there came into her quiet,
                        lovely face a delightful smile. He could not conceal his amazement. She was
                        glad to see him! Instantly, following the invariable habit of an experienced
                        analytical mind, he wondered for what unflattering reason this young woman
                        who did not like him was no longer showing it, was seeming more than a
                        little pleased to see him. &quot;Why, how d&apos;ye do, Mr.
                        Norman?&quot; said she. And her friendliness and assurance of manner
                        jarred upon him. There was not a suggestion of forwardness; but he, used to
                        her old-time extreme reserve, felt precisely as if she were bold and gaudy,
                        after the fashion of so many of the working girls who were popular with the
                        men.</p>
                    <p>This unfavorable impression disappearedor, rather, retired to the
                        backgroundeven as it became definite. And once more he was seeing the charms
                        of <pb id="VAA2369-301" n="296"/> physical loveliness, of physicaland moral,
                        and mentalmystery that had a weird power over him. As they shook hands, a
                        quiver shot through him as at the shock of a terrific stimulant; and he
                        stood there longing to take her in his arms, to feel the delicate yet
                        perfect and vividly vital life of that fascinating formlonging to kiss that
                        sensitive, slightly pouted rosy mouth, to try to make those clear eyes grow
                        soft and dreamy</p>
                    <p>She was saying: &quot;I&apos;ve been wondering what had become of
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw Tetlow,&quot; he said. &quot;He promised to send me
                        your address.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At Tetlow&apos;s name she frowned slightly; then a gleam of ridicule
                        flitted into her eyes. &quot;Oh, that silly, squeamish old maid! How
                        sick I got of him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman winced, and his jealousy stirred. &quot;Why?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Always warning me against everybody. Always giving me advice. It
                        was too tiresome. And at last he began to criticize methe way I dressedthe
                        way I talkedsaid I was getting too free in my manner. The impudence of
                        him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman tried to smile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;d have liked me to stay a silly little mouse
                        forever.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So you&apos;ve beenblossoming out?&quot; said Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In a quiet way,&quot; replied she, with a smile of selfcontent,
                            <pb id="VAA2369-302" n="297"/> so lovely as a smile that no one would
                        have minded its frank egotism. &quot;There isn&apos;t much chance
                        for fununless a girl goes too far. But at the same time I don&apos;t
                        intend life to be Sunday when it isn&apos;t work. I got very cross with
                        himMr. Tetlow, I mean. And I took another position. It didn&apos;t pay
                        quite so wellonly fifteen a week. But I couldn&apos;t stand being
                        watchedand guyed by all the other girls and boys for it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where are you working?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;With an old lawyer named Branscombe. It&apos;s awful slow, as
                        I&apos;m the only one, and he&apos;s old and does everything in an
                        old-fashioned way. But the hours are easy, and I don&apos;t have to get
                        down till ninewhich is nice when you&apos;ve been out at a dance the
                        night before.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman kept his eyes down to hide from her the legion of devils of jealousy.
                        &quot;You <hi rend="i">have</hi> changed,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m growing up,&quot; replied she with a charming toss
                        of her small headwhat beautiful effects the sunlight made in among those
                        wavy strands and strays!</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you&apos;re as lovely as everlovelier,&quot; he saidand
                        his eyes were the eyes of the slave she had spurned.</p>
                    <p>She did not spurn him nowand it inflamed his jealousy that she did not. She
                        said: &quot;Oh, what&apos;s the good of looks? The town&apos;s
                        full of pretty girls. And so many of them have moneywhich I
                        haven&apos;t. To <pb id="VAA2369-303" n="298"/> make a hit in New York a
                        girl&apos;s got to have both looks and dress. But I must be going.
                        I&apos;ve an engagement to lunch&quot; She gave a proud little
                        smile&quot;at the Astor House. It&apos;s nice upstairs
                        there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;With Bob Culver?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She laughed. &quot;I haven&apos;t seen him since I left his office.
                        You know, Mr. Tetlow took me with himback to your old firm. I
                        didn&apos;t like Mr. Culver. I don&apos;t care for those black men.
                        They are bad-tempered and two-faced. Anyhow, I&apos;d not have anything
                        to do with a man who wanted to slip round with me as if he were ashamed of
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was looking at Norman pleasantly enough. He wasn&apos;t sure that the
                        hit was for him as well as for Culver, but he flushed deeply. &quot;Will
                        you lunch with me at the Astor House at one to-morrow?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve got an engagement,&quot; said she. &quot;And
                        I must be going. I&apos;m awfully late.&quot; He had an instinct
                        that her engagement on both days was with the same man.
                        &quot;I&apos;m glad to have seen you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you let me call on you?&quot; he said
                        imploringly, but with the suggestion that he had no hope of being permitted
                        to come.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; responded she with friendly promptness. She
                        opened the shopping bag swinging on her arm. &quot;Here is one of my
                        cards.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When? This evening?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her laugh showed the beautiful deep pink and dazzling <pb id="VAA2369-304"
                            n="299"/> white behind her lips. &quot;NoI&apos;m going to a
                        party.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me take you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t like it. Only young
                        people.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I&apos;m not so old.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him critically. &quot;Noyou&apos;re not. It always
                        puzzled me. You aren&apos;t oldyou look like a boy lots of the time. But
                        you always <hi rend="i">seem</hi> old to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll try to do better. To-night?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not to-night,&quot; laughed she. &quot;Let&apos;s
                        seeto-morrow&apos;s Sunday. Come to-morrowabout half past two.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; he said so gratefully that he cursed himself
                        for his folly as he heard his voicethe idiotic folly of so plainly betraying
                        his feelings. No wonder she despised him! Beginning againand beginning
                        wrong.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-by.&quot; Her eyes, her smile flashed and he was alone,
                        watching her slender grace glide through the throngs of lower Broadway.</p>
                    <p>At his office again at three, he found a note from Tetlow inclosing another
                        of Dorothy&apos;s cards and also the promised check. Into his face came
                        the look that always comes into the faces of the prisoners of despair when
                        the bolts slide back and the heavy door swings and hope stands on the
                        threshold instead of the famillar <pb id="VAA2369-305" n="300"/> grim figure
                        of the jailer. &quot;This looks like the turn of the road,&quot; he
                        muttered. Yes, a turn it certainly wasbut was it <hi rend="i">the</hi> turn?
                        &quot;I&apos;ll know more as to that,&quot; said he with a
                        glance at the clock, &quot;about this time to-morrow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was a boarding house on the west side. And when the slovenly, smelly maid
                        said, &quot;Go right up to her room,&quot; he knew it wasprobably
                        respectable, but not rigidly respectable. However, working girls must
                        receive, and they cannot afford parlors and chaperons. Still It was no place
                        for a lovely young girl, full of charm and of love of lifeand not brought up
                        in the class where the women are trained from babyhood to protect
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>He ascended two flights, knocked at the door to the rear.
                        &quot;Come!&quot; called a voice, and he entered. It was a small
                        neat room, arranged comfortably and with some taste. He recognized at first
                        glance many little things from her room in the Jersey City housethings he
                        had provided for her. On the chimney piece was a large photograph of her
                        fatherNorman&apos;s eyes hastily shifted from that. The bed was folded
                        away into a couchfor space and for respectability. At first he did not see
                        her. But when he advanced a step farther, she was disclosed in the doorway
                        of a deep closet that contained a stationary washstand.</p>
                    <p>He had never seen her when she was not fully <pb id="VAA2369-306" n="301"/>
                        dressed. He was now seeing her in a kind of wrapperof pale blue, clean but
                        not fresh. It was open at the throat; its sleeves fell away from her arms.
                        And, to cap the climax of his agitation, her hair, her wonderful hair, was
                        flowing loosely about her face and shoulders.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter with you?&quot; she cried
                        laughingly. Her eyes sparkled and danced; the waves of her hair, each hair
                        standing out as if it were alive, sparkled and danced. It was a smile never
                        to be forgotten. &quot;Why are you so embarrassed?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was embarrassed. He was thrilled. He was enragedenraged because, if she
                        would thus receive him whom she did not like, she would certainly thus
                        receive any man.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t mind you,&quot; she went on, mockingly.
                        &quot;I&apos;d have to be careful if it was one of the
                        boys.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you receive theboyshere?&quot; demanded he glumly, his voice
                        arrogant with the possessive rights a man feels when he cares for a woman,
                        whether she cares for him or not.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not?&quot; scoffed she. &quot;Where else would I see
                        them? I don&apos;t make street corner dates, thank you. You&apos;re
                        as bad as fat, foolish Mr. Tetlow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; said he humbly.</p>
                    <p>She straightway relented, saying: &quot;Of course I&apos;d not let
                        one of the boys come up when I was dressed like this. But I didn&apos;t
                        mind <hi rend="i">you</hi>.&quot; He winced at this amiable, unconscious
                        reminder of her always exasperating <pb id="VAA2369-307" n="302"/> and
                        tantalizing and humiliating indifference to him&quot;And as I&apos;m
                        going to a grand dance to-night I simply had to wash my hair. Does that
                        satisfy you, Mr. Primmey?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He hid the torment of his reopened wound and seated himself at the center
                        table. She returned to a chair in the window where the full force of the
                        afternoon sun would concentrate upon her hair. And he gazed spell bound. He
                        had always known that her hair was fine. He had never dreamed it was like
                        this. It was thick, it was fine and soft. In color, as the sunbeams streamed
                        upon it, it was all the shades of gold and all the other beautiful shades
                        between brown and red. It fell about her face, about her neck, about her
                        shoulders in a gorgeous veil. And her pure white skin It was an even more
                        wonderful white below the line of her collar where he had never seen it
                        before. Such exquisitely modeled earssuch a delicate noseand the curve of
                        her cheeksand the glory of her eyes! He clinched his teeth and his hands,
                        sat dumb with his gaze down.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you like my room?&quot; she chattered on.
                        &quot;It&apos;s not so badreally quite comfortablethough
                        I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ll be cold when the weather changes. But
                        it&apos;s the best I can do. As it is, I don&apos;t see how
                        I&apos;m going to make ends meet. I pay twelve of my fifteen for this
                        room and two meals. The rest goes for lunch and car fare. As soon as I have
                        to get clothes&quot; She broke off, laughing.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-308" n="303"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;what then?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t know,&quot; replied she
                        carelessly. &quot;Perhaps old Mr. Branscombe&apos;ll give me a
                        raise. Still, eighteen or twenty is the most I could hope forand that
                        wouldn&apos;t mean enough for clothes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head vigorously and her hair stood out yet more vividly and the
                        sunbeams seemed to go mad with joy as they danced over and under and through
                        it. He had ventured to glance up; again he hastily looked down.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You spoiled me,&quot; she went on. &quot;Those few months
                        over there in Jersey City. It made <hi rend="i">such</hi> a change in me,
                        though I didn&apos;t realize it at the time. You see, I hadn&apos;t
                        known since I was a tiny little girl what it was to live really decently,
                        and so I was able to get along quite contentedly. I didn&apos;t know any
                        better.&quot; She made a wry face. &quot;How I loathe the canned and
                        cold storage stuff I have to eat nowadays. And how I do miss the beautiful
                        room I had in that big house over there! and how I miss Molly and Patand the
                        gardenand doing as I pleasedand the clothes I had: I thought I was being
                        careful and not spoiling myself. You may not believe it, but I was really
                        conscientious about spending money.&quot; She laughed in a queer, absent
                        way. &quot;I had such a funny idea of what I had a right to do and what
                        I hadn&apos;t. And I didn&apos;t spend so very much on out-and-out
                        luxury. Butenough to spoil me for this life.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-309" n="304"/>
                    <p>As Norman listened, as he notedin her appearance, manner, way of talkingthe
                        many meaning signs of the girl hesitating at the fork of the roadshe felt
                        within him the twinges of fear, of jealousyand through fear and jealousy,
                        the twinges of conscience. She was telling the truth. He had undermined her
                        ability to live in purity the life to which her earning power assigned
                        her.... <hi rend="i">Why</hi> had she been so friendly to him? Why had she
                        received him in this informal, almost if not quite inviting fashion?</p>
                    <p>&quot;So you think I&apos;ve changed?&quot; she was saying.
                        &quot;WellI have. Gracious, what a little fool I was!&quot;</p>
                    <p>His eyes lifted with an agonized question in them.</p>
                    <p>She flushed, glanced away, glanced at him again with the old, sweet
                        expression of childlike innocence which had so often made him wonder whether
                        it was merely a mannerism, or was a trick, or was indeed a beam from a pure
                        soul. &quot;I&apos;m foolish stillin certain ways,&quot; she
                        said significantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you always intend to be?&quot; suggested he with a forced
                        smile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ohyes,&quot; replied shepositively enough, yet it somehow had
                        not the full force of her simple short statements in the former days.</p>
                    <p>He believed her. Perhaps because he wished to believe, must believe, would
                        have been driven quite mad by disbelief. Still, he believed. As yet she was
                        good. But it would not last much longer. With himor <pb id="VAA2369-310"
                            n="305"/> with some other. If with him, then certainly afterward with
                        anotherwith others. No matter how jealously he might guard her, she would go
                        that road, if once she entered it. If he would have her for his very own he
                        must strengthen her, not weaken her, must keep her &quot;foolish stillin
                        certain ways.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He said: &quot;There&apos;s nothing in the other sort of
                        life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s what they say,&quot; replied she, with ominous
                        irritation. &quot;Stillsome girls<hi rend="i">lots</hi> of girls seem to
                        get on mighty well without being so terribly particular.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You ought to see them after a few years.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m only twenty-one,&quot; laughed she.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve got lots of time before I&apos;m old.... You
                        haven&apos;tmarried?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I&apos;d have heard, if you had.&quot; She
                        laughed queerlyagain shook out her hair, and it shimmered round her face and
                        over her head and out from her shoulders like flames.
                        &quot;You&apos;ve got a kind of aMr. Tetlow way of talking. It
                        doesn&apos;t remind me of you as you were in Jersey City.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She said nothing, she suggested nothing that had the least impropriety in it,
                        or faintest hint of impropriety. It was nothing positive, nothing
                        aggressive, but a certain vague negative something that gave him the
                        impression of innocence still innocent but looking or trying to look
                        tolerantly where it should not. And he felt dizzy and sick, stricken with
                        shame and remorse <pb id="VAA2369-311" n="306"/> and jealous fear. Yesshe
                        was sliding slowly, gently, unconsciously down to the depth in which he had
                        been lying, sick and shudderingno, to deeper depthsto the depths where there
                        is no light, no trace of a return path. And he had started her down. He had
                        done it when he, in his pride and selfishness, had ignored what the success
                        of his project would mean for her. But he knew now; in bitterness and shame
                        and degradation he had learned. &quot;I was infamous!&quot; he said
                        to himself.</p>
                    <p>She began to talk in a low, embarrassed voice: &quot;Sometimes I think of
                        getting married. There&apos;s a young mana young lawyerhe makes
                        twenty-five a week, but it&apos;ll be years and years before he has a
                        good living. A man doesn&apos;t get on fast in New York unless he has
                        pull.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman, roused from his remorse, blazed inside. &quot;You are in love
                        with him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She laughed, and he could not tell whether it was to tease him or to evade.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d not care about him long,&quot; said Norman,
                        &quot;unless there were more money coming in than he&apos;d be
                        likely to get soon. Love without money doesn&apos;t goat least, not in
                        New York.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you suppose I don&apos;t know that?&quot; said she with
                        the irritation of one faced by a hateful fact. &quot;StillI
                        don&apos;t see what to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman, biting his lip and fuming and observing <pb id="VAA2369-312" n="307"
                        /> her with jealous eyes, said in the best voice he could command,
                        &quot;How long have you been in love with him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did I say I was in love?&quot; mocked she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You didn&apos;t say you weren&apos;t. Who is he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you&apos;ll stay on about half an hour or so,
                        you&apos;ll see him. Noyou can&apos;t. I&apos;ve got to get
                        dressed before I let him up. He has very strict ideaswhere I&apos;m
                        concerned.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then why did you let <hi rend="i">me</hi> come up?&quot; Norman
                        said, with a penetrating glance.</p>
                    <p>She lowered her gaze and a faint flush stole into her cheeks. Was it
                        confession of the purpose he suspected? Or, was it merely embarrassment?</p>
                    <p>&quot;I heard of a case once,&quot; continued Norman, his gaze
                        significantly direct, &quot;the case of a girl who was in love with a
                        poor young fellow. She wanted moneyluxury. Also, she wanted the poor young
                        fellow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The color flamed into the girl&apos;s face, then left it pale. Her white
                        fingers fluttered with nervous grace into her masses of hair and back to her
                        lap again, to rest there in timid quiet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She knew another man,&quot; pursued Norman, &quot;one who
                        was able to give her what she wanted in the way of comfort. So, she decided
                        to make an arrangement with the man, and keep it hidden from her loverand in
                        that way get along pleasantly until her lover was in better
                        circumstances.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her gaze was upon her hands, listless in her lap. He <pb id="VAA2369-313"
                            n="308"/> felt that he had spoken her unspoken, probably unformed
                        thoughts. Yes, unformed. Men and women, especially women, habitually pursued
                        these unacknowledged and even unformed purposes, in their conflicts of the
                        desire to get what they wanted and their desire to appear well to
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What would you think of an arrangement like that?&quot; asked
                        he, determined to draw her secret heart into the open where he could see,
                        where she could see.</p>
                    <p>She lifted frank, guileless eyes to his. &quot;I suppose the girl was
                        trying to do the best she could.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you think of a girl who&apos;d do that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t judge anybodyany more. I&apos;ve found out
                        that this world isn&apos;t at all as I thoughtas I was taught.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would <hi rend="i">you</hi> do it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She smiled faintly. &quot;No,&quot; she replied uncertainly. Then she
                        restored his wavering belief in her essential honesty and truthfulness by
                        adding: &quot;That is to say, I don&apos;t think I would.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She busied herself with her hair, feeling it to see whether it was not yet
                        dry, spreading it out. He looked at her unseeingly. At last she said:
                        &quot;You must go. I&apos;ve got to get dressed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;YesI must be going,&quot; said he absently, rising and reaching
                        for his hat on the center table.</p>
                    <p>She stood up, put out her hand. &quot;I&apos;m glad you
                        came.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-314" n="309"/>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said he, still in the same abstraction. He
                        shook hands with her, moved hesitatingly toward the door. With his hand on
                        the knob he turned and glanced keenly at her. He surprised in her face a
                        look of mysteryof seriousness, of sadnesswas there anxiety in it, also? And
                        then he saw a certain elusive reminder of her fatherand it brought to him
                        with curious force the memory of how she had been brought up, of what must
                        be hers by inheritance and by trainingshe, the daughter of a great and
                        simple and noble man</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll come again?&quot; she said, and there was the
                        note in her voice that made his nerves grow tense and vibrate.</p>
                    <p>But he seemed not to have heard her question. Still at the unopened door, he
                        folded his arms upon his chest and said, speaking rapidly yet with the
                        deliberation of one who has thought out his words in advance:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know what kind of girl you are. I never have
                        known. I&apos;ve never wanted to know. If you told me you werewhat is
                        called good, I&apos;d doubt it. If you told me you weren&apos;t,
                        I&apos;d want to kill you and myself. They say there&apos;s a fatal
                        woman for every man and a fatal man for every woman. I always laughed at the
                        ideauntil you. I don&apos;t know what to make of myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She suddenly laid her finger on her lips. It irritated him, to discover that,
                        as he talked, speaking the things that came from the very depths of his
                        soul, she had been giving him only part of her attention, had been listening
                            <pb id="VAA2369-315" n="310"/> for a step on the stairs. He was hearing
                        the ascending step now. He frowned. &quot;Can&apos;t you send him
                        away?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I must,&quot; said she in a low tone. &quot;It
                        wouldn&apos;t do for him to know you were here. He has strict ideasand
                        is terribly jealous.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A few seconds of silence, then a knock on the other side of the door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who&apos;s there?&quot; she called.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m a little early,&quot; came in an agreeable, young
                        man&apos;s voice. &quot;Aren&apos;t you ready?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not nearly,&quot; replied she, in a laughing, innocent voice.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll have to go away for half an hour.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll wait out here on the steps.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her eyes were sparkling. A delicate color had mounted to her skin. Norman,
                        watching her jealously, clinched his strong jaws. She said: &quot;Noyou
                        must go clear away. I don&apos;t want to feel that I&apos;m being
                        hurried. Don&apos;t come back until a quarter past four.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right. I&apos;m crazy to see you.&quot; This in the
                        voice of a lover. She smiled radiantly at Norman, as if she thought he would
                        share in her happiness at these evidences of her being well loved. The
                        unseen young man said: &quot;Exactly a quarter past. What time does your
                        clock say it is now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A quarter to,&quot; replied she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s what my watch says. So there&apos;ll be no
                        mistake. For half an hourgood-by!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-316" n="311"/>
                    <p>&quot;Half an hour!&quot; she called.</p>
                    <p>She and Norman stood in silence until the footsteps died away. Then she said
                        crossly to Norman: &quot;You ought to have gone before. I don&apos;t
                        like to do these things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You do them well,&quot; said he, with a savage gleam.</p>
                    <p>She was prompt and sure with his punishment. She said, simply and sweetly:
                        &quot;I&apos;d do anything to keep <hi rend="i">his</hi> good
                        opinion of me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman felt and looked cowed. &quot;You don&apos;t know how it makes
                        me suffer to see you fond of another man,&quot; he cried.</p>
                    <p>She seemed not in the least interested, went to the mirror of the bureau and
                        began to inspect her hair with a view to doing it up. &quot;You can go
                        in five minutes,&quot; said she. &quot;By that time he&apos;ll
                        be well out of the way. Anyhow, if he saw you leaving the house
                        he&apos;d not know but what you had been to see some one else. He knows
                        you by reputation but not by sight.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman went to her, took her by the shoulders gently but strongly.
                        &quot;Look at me,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>She looked at him with an expression, or perhaps absence of expression, that
                        was simple listening.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you meant awhile ago some such thing as I hintedI will have
                        nothing to do with it. You must marry meor it&apos;s nothing at
                        all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her gaze did not wander, but before his wondering eyes she seemed to fade,
                        fade toward colorlessness insignificance. <pb id="VAA2369-317" n="312"/> The
                        light died from her eyes, the flush of health from her white skin, the
                        freshness from her lips, the sparkle and vitality from her hair. A slow,
                        gradual transformation, which he watched with a frightened tightening at the
                        heart.</p>
                    <p>She said slowly: &quot;Youwantmeto<hi rend="i">marry</hi>you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve always wanted it, though I didn&apos;t
                        realize,&quot; replied he. &quot;How else could I be sure of you?
                        Besides&quot; He flushed, added hurriedly, almost in an undertone
                        &quot;I owe it to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She seated herself deliberately.</p>
                    <p>After he had waited in vain for her to speak, he went on: &quot;If you
                        married me, I know you&apos;d play square. I could trust you absolutely.
                        I don&apos;t knowcan&apos;t find out much about youbut at least I
                        know that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I don&apos;t love you,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You needn&apos;t remind me of it,&quot; rejoined he curtly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think soso poorly of you as I used to,&quot;
                        she went on. &quot;I understand a lot of things better than I did. But I
                        don&apos;t love you, and I feel that I never could.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll risk that,&quot; said Norman. Through his
                        clinched teeth, &quot;I&apos;ve got to risk it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d be marrying you because I don&apos;t feel able
                        toto make my own way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the reason most girls have for marrying,&quot;
                        said he. &quot;Love comes afterwardif it comes. And <pb id="VAA2369-318"
                            n="313"/> it&apos;s the more likely to come for the girl not having
                        faked the man and herself beforehand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She glanced at the clock. He frowned. She started up. &quot;You <hi
                            rend="i">must</hi> go,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is your answer?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I couldn&apos;t decide so quickly. I must think.&quot;</p>

                        isn&apos;t some way of working it out with him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That, too,&quot; replied she simply. &quot;Butit&apos;s
                        nearly four o&apos;clock&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll come back at seven for my answer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I&apos;ll write you to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I must know at once. This suspense has got to end. It unfits me for
                        everything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;llI&apos;ll decideto-night,&quot; she said, with
                        a queer catch in her voice. &quot;You&apos;ll get the letter in the
                        morning mail.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well.&quot; And he gave her his club address.</p>
                    <p>She opened the door in her impatience to be rid of him. He went with a hasty
                        &quot;Good-by&quot; which she echoed as she closed the door.</p>
                    <p>When he left the house he saw standing on the curb before it a tall,
                        good-looking young manwith a frank amiable face. He hesitated, glowering at
                        the young man&apos;s profile. Then he went his way, suffocating with
                        jealous anger, depressed, despondent, fit for nothing but to drink and to
                        brood in fatuous futility.</p>

                    <p>U<hi rend="sc">NTIL</hi> very recently indeed psychology was not an ology at
                        all but an indefinite something or other &quot;up in the air,&quot;
                        the sport of the winds and fogs of transcendental tommy rot. Now, however,
                        science has drawn it down, has fitted it in its proper place as a branch of
                        physiology. And we are beginning to have a clearer understanding of the
                        thoughts and the thought-producing actions of ourselves and our fellow
                        beings. Soon it will be no longer possible for the historian and the
                        novelist, the dramatist, the poet, the painter or sculptor to present in all
                        seriousness as instances of sane human conduct, the aberrations resulting
                        from various forms of disease ranging from indigestion in its mild,
                        temperbreeding forms to acute homicidal or suicidal mania. In that day of
                        greater enlightenment a large body of now much esteemed art will become
                        ridiculous. Practically all the literature of strenuous passion will go by
                        the board or will be relegated to the medical library where it belongs; and
                        it, and the annals of violence found in the daily newspapers of our remote
                        time will be cited as documentary proof of the low economic and hygienic
                        conditions prevailing in that almost barbarous <pb id="VAA2369-320" n="315"
                        /> period. For certain it is that the human animal when healthy and well fed
                        is invariably peaceable and kindly and tolerantup to the limits of
                        selfishness, and even encroaching upon those limits.</p>
                    <p>Of writing rubbish about love and passion there is no endand will be no end
                        until the venerable traditional nonsense about those interesting emotions
                        shares the fate that should overtake all the cobwebs of ignorance thickly
                        clogging the windows and walls of the human mind. Of all the fiddle-faddle
                        concerning passion probably none is more shudderingly admired than the
                        notion that one possessed of an overwhelming desire for another longs to
                        destroy that other. It is true there is a form of murderous mania that
                        involves practically all the emotions, including of course the passionswhich
                        are as readily subject to derangement as any other part of the human
                        organism. But passion in itselfeven when it is so powerful that it dominates
                        the whole life, as in the case of Frederick Normanpassion in itself is not a
                        form of mental derangement in the medical sense. And it does not produce
                        acute selfishness, paranoiac egotism, but a generous and beautiful kind of
                        unselfishness. Not from the first moment of Fred Norman&apos;s
                        possession did he wish to injure or in any way to make unhappy the girl he
                        loved. He longed to be happy with her, to have her happy with and through
                        him. He represented his plotting to himself as a plan to make her happier
                        than she ever had been; as for <pb id="VAA2369-321" n="316"/> ultimate
                        consequences, he refused to consider them. The most hardened rake, when
                        passion possesses him, wishes all happiness to the woman of his pursuit.
                        Indifference, coldnessthe natural hard-heartedness of the normal manreturns
                        only when the inspiration and elevation of passion disappear in satiety. The
                        man or the woman who continues to inspire passion continues to inspire
                        tenderness and considerateness.</p>
                    <p>So when Norman left Dorothy that Sunday afternoon, he, being a normal if sore
                        beset human being, was soon in the throes of an agonized remorse. There may
                        have been some hypocrisy in it, some struggling to cover up the baser
                        elements in his infatuation for her. What human emotion of upward tendency
                        has not at least a little of the varnish of hypocrisy on certain less
                        presentable spots in it? But in the main it was a creditable, a manly
                        remorse, and not altogether the writhings of jealousy and jealous fear of
                        losing her.</p>
                    <p>He saw clearly that she was telling the truth, and telling it too gently,
                        when she said he was responsible for her having standards of living which
                        she could not unaided hope to attain. It is a dreadful thing to interfere in
                        the destiny of a fellow being. We do it all the time; we do it lightly.
                        Nevertheless, it is a dreadful thingnot one that ought not to be done, but
                        one that ought to be done only under imperative compulsion, and then with
                        every precaution. He had interfered in Dorothy Hallowell&apos;s destiny.
                        He had lifted her out of <pb id="VAA2369-322" n="317"/> the dim obscure
                        niche where she was ensconced in comparative contentment. He had lifted her
                        up where she had seen and felt the pleasures of a life of luxury.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But for me,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;she would now
                        be marrying this poor young lawyer, or some chap of the same sort, and would
                        be looking forward to a life of happiness in a little flat or suburban
                        cottage.&quot;</p>
                    <p>If she should refuse his offerwhat then? Clearly he ought to do his best to
                        help her to happiness with the other man. He smiled cynically at the moral
                        height to which his logic thus pointed the way. Nevertheless, he did not
                        turn away but surveyed itand there formed in his mind an impulse to make an
                        effort to attempt that height, if Fate should rule against him with her.
                        &quot;If I were a really decent man,&quot; thought he,
                        &quot;I&apos;d sit down now and write her that I would not marry her
                        but would give her young man a friendly hand in the law if she wished to
                        marry him.&quot; But he knew that such utter generosity was far beyond
                        him. &quot;Only a hero could do it,&quot; said he; he added with
                        what a sentimentalist might have called a return of his normal cynicism,
                        &quot;only a hero who really in the bottom of his heart didn&apos;t
                        especially want the girl.&quot; And a candid person of experience might
                        possibly admit that there was more truth than cynicism in his look askance
                        at the grand army of martyrs of renunciation, most of whom have simply given
                        up something they didn&apos;t really want.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-323" n="318"/>
                    <p>&quot;If she accepts me, I&apos;ll make it impossible for her not to
                        be happy,&quot; he said to himself, in all the fine unselfishness of
                        passionnot divine unselfishness but humannot the kind we read about and
                        pretend to have and get a savage attack of bruised vanity if we are accused
                        of not having itno, but just the kind we have and show in our daily livesthe
                        unselfishness of longing to make happy those whom it would make us happier
                        to see happy. &quot;She may think she cares for this young
                        clerk&quot; so ran his thoughts&quot;but she doesn&apos;t know
                        her own mind. When she is mine, I&apos;ll take her in hand as a gardener
                        does a delicate rare flowerand, by Heaven, how I shall make her blossom and
                        bloom!&quot;</p>
                    <p>It would hardly be possible for a human being to pass a stormier night than
                        was that night of his. Alternations between hope and despairfantastic
                        pictures of future with and without her, wild pleadings with herthose
                        delirious transports to which our imaginations give way if we happen to be
                        blessed and cursed with imaginationsin the security of the darkness and
                        aloneness of night and bed. And through it all he was tormented body and
                        soul by her lovelinessher hair, her skin, her eyes, the shy, slender graces
                        of her formHe tossed about until his bed was so wildly disheveled that he
                        had to rise and remake it.</p>
                    <p>When day came and the first mail, there was her letter on the salver of the
                        boy entering the room. <pb id="VAA2369-324" n="319"/> He reached for it with
                        eager, trembling arm, drew back. &quot;Put it on the table,&quot; he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>The boy left. He was alone. Leaning upon his elbow in the bed he stared at
                        the letter with hollow, terrified eyes. It contained his destiny. If she
                        accepted, he would go up, for his soul sickness would be cured. If she
                        refused, he would cease to struggle. He rose, took from a locked drawer a
                        bottle of rye whisky. He poured a tall glassthe kind called a bar glasshalf
                        full, drank it straight down without a pause or a quiver. The shock brought
                        him up standing. He looked and acted like his former self as he went to the
                        table, took the letter, opened it, and read: <text>
                            <body>

                                        but dark ahead.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Norman struggled over to the bed, threw himself down, flat upon his back,
                        arms and legs extended wide and whole body relaxed. He felt the blood whirl
                        up into his brain like the great red and black tongues of flame and smoke in
                        a conflagration, and then he slept soundly until nearly one
                        o&apos;clock.</p>
                    <p>To an outsider there would have been a world of homely commonplace pathos in
                        that little letter of the girl&apos;s if read aright, that is to say, if
                        read with what was between the lines supplied. It is impossible to live <pb
                            id="VAA2369-325" n="320"/> in cities any length of time and with any
                        sort of eyes without learning the bitter unromantic truths about povertycity
                        poverty. In quiet, desolate places one may be poor, very poor, without much
                        conscious suffering. There are no teasing contrasts, no torturing
                        temptations. But in a city, if one knows anything at all of the
                        possibilities of civilized life, of the joys and comforts of good food,
                        clothing, and shelter, of theater and concert and excursion, of entertaining
                        and being entertained, poverty becomes a hell. In the country, in the quiet
                        towns, the innocent people wonder at the greediness of the more comfortable
                        kinds of city people, at their love of money, their incessant dwelling upon
                        it, their reverence for those who have it, their panic-like flight from
                        those who have it not. They wonder how folk, apparently human, can be so
                        inhuman. Let them be careful how they judge. If you discover any human being
                        anywhere acting as you think a human being should not, investigate all the
                        circumstances, look thoroughly into all the causes of his or her conduct,
                        before you condemn him or her as inhuman, unworthy of your kinship and your
                        sympathy.</p>
                    <p>In her brief letter the girl showed that, young though she was and not widely
                        experienced in life, she yet had seen the horrors of city poverty, how it
                        poisons and kills all the fine emotions. She had seen many a loving young
                        couple start out confidently, with a few hundred dollars of debt for
                        furniturehad seen the love fade <pb id="VAA2369-326" n="321"/> and wither,
                        shrivel, diehad seen appear peevishness and hatred and unfaithfulness and
                        all the huge, foul weeds that choke the flowers of married life. She knew
                        what her lover&apos;s salary would buyand what it would not buyfor two.
                        She could imagine their fate if there should be three or more. She showed
                        frankly her selfishness of renunciation. But there could be read between the
                        linesconcealed instead of vauntedperhaps unsuspectedher unselfishness of
                        renunciation for the sake of her lover and for the sake of the child or the
                        children that might be. In our love of moral sham and glitter, we overlook
                        the real beauties of human morality; we even are so dim or vulgar sighted
                        that we do not see them when they are shown to us.</p>
                    <p>As Norman awakened, he reached for the telephone, said to the boy in charge
                        of the club exchange: &quot;Look in the book, find the number of a
                        lawyer named Branscombe, and connect me with his office.&quot; After
                        some confusion and delay he got the right office, but Dorothy was out at
                        lunch. He left a message that she was to call him up at the club as soon as
                        she came in. He was shaving when the bell rang.</p>
                    <p>He was at the receiver in a bound. &quot;Is it you?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; came in her quiet, small voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you resign down there to-day? Will you marry me this
                        afternoon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>A brief silence, then&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

                    <p>Thus it came about that they met at the City Hall license bureau, got their
                        license, and half an hour later were married at the house of a minister in
                        East Thirty-third Street, within a block of the Subway station. He was
                        feverish, gay, looked years younger than his thirty-seven. She was quiet,
                        dim, passive, neither grave nor gay, but going through her part without
                        hesitation, with much the same patient, plodding expression she habitually
                        bore as she sat working at her machineas if she did not quite understand,
                        but was doing her best and hoped to get through not so badly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve had nothing to eat,&quot; said he as they came
                        out of the parsonage.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nor I,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll go to Delmonico&apos;s,&quot; said he, and
                        hailed a passing taxi.</p>
                    <p>On the way, he sitting in one corner explained to her, shrunk into the other
                        corner: &quot;I can confess now that I married you under false
                        pretenses. I am not prosperous, as I used to be. To be brief and plain,
                        I&apos;m down and out, professionally.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not move. Apparently she did not change expression. Yet he, speaking
                        half banteringly, felt some frightful catastrophe within her. &quot;You
                        arepoor?&quot; she said in her usual quiet way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">We</hi> are poor,&quot; corrected he. &quot;I
                        have at present only a thousand dollars a montha little more, but not enough
                        to talk about.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-328" n="323"/>
                    <p>She did not move or change expression. Yet he felt that her heart, her blood
                        were going on again.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are youangry?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A thousand dollars a month seems an awful lot of money to
                        me,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s nothingnothing to what we&apos;ll soon have.
                        Trust me.&quot; And back into his eyes flashed their former look.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve been sick. I&apos;m well again. I shall get what
                        I want. If you want anything, you&apos;ve only to ask for it.
                        I&apos;ll get it. I know how.... I don&apos;t prey,
                        myselfI&apos;ve no fancy for the brutal sports. But I teach lions how to
                        prey, and I make them pay for the lessons.&quot; He laughed with an
                        effervescing of young vitality and self-confidence that made him look
                        handsome and powerful. &quot;In the future they&apos;ll have to pay
                        still higher prices.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was looking at him with weary, wondering, pathetic eyes that gazed from
                        the pallor of her dead-white face mysteriously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you thinking?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was listening,&quot; replied she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Doesn&apos;t it make you happywhat you are going to
                        have?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied she. &quot;But it makes me
                        content.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With eyes suddenly suffused, he took her handso gently.
                        &quot;Dorothy,&quot; he said, &quot;you will try to love
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll try,&quot; said she. &quot;You&apos;ll be
                        kind to me?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-329" n="324"/>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t be anything else,&quot; he cried. And in a
                        gust of passion he caught her to his breast and kissed her triumphantly.
                        &quot;I love youand you&apos;re minemine!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She released herself with the faint insistent push that seemed weak, but
                        always accomplished its purpose. Her lip was trembling. &quot;You said
                        you&apos;d be kind,&quot; she murmured.</p>
                    <p>He gazed at her with a baffled expression. &quot;OhI
                        understand,&quot; he said. &quot;And I shall be kind. But I must
                        teach you to love me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her trembling lip steadied. &quot;You must be careful or you may teach me
                        to hate you,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>He studied her in a puzzled way, laughed. &quot;What a mystery you
                        are!&quot; he cried with raillery. &quot;Are you child or are you
                        woman? No matter. We shall be happy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The taxicab was swinging to the curb. In the restaurant he ordered an
                        enormous meal. And he ate enormously, and drank in due proportion. She ate
                        and drank a good deal herselfa good deal for her. And the results were soon
                        apparent in a return of the spirits that are normal to twenty-one years,
                        regardless of what may be lurking in the heart, in a dark corner, to come
                        forth and torment when there is nothing to distract the attention.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We shall have to live quietly for a while,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;Of course you must have clothesat once. I&apos;ll take <pb
                            id="VAA2369-330" n="325"/> you shopping to-morrow.&quot; He laughed
                        grimly. &quot;Just at present we can get only what we pay cash for.
                        Still, you won&apos;t need much. Later on I&apos;ll take you over to
                        Paris. Does that attract you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her eyes shone. &quot;How soon?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can tell you in a week or ten days.&quot; He became
                        abstracted for a moment. &quot;I can&apos;t understand how I let
                        them get me down so easilythat is, I can&apos;t understand it now. I
                        suppose it&apos;s just the difference between being weak with illness
                        and strong with health.&quot; His eyes concentrated on her. &quot;Is
                        it really you?&quot; he cried gaily. &quot;And are you really mine?
                        No wonder I feel strong! It was always that way with me. I never could leave
                        a thing until I had conquered it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She gave him a sweet smile. &quot;I&apos;m not worth all the trouble
                        you seem to have taken about me,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>He laughed; for he knew the intense vanity so pleasantly hidden beneath her
                        shy and modest exterior. &quot;On the contrary,&quot; said he
                        good-humoredly, &quot;you in your heart think yourself worth any amount
                        of trouble. It&apos;s a habit we men have got you women into. And you
                        One of the many things that fascinate me in you is your supreme
                        self-control. If the king were to come down from his throne and fall at your
                        feet, you&apos;d take it as a matter of course.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She gazed away dreamily. And he understood that her indifference to matters
                        of rank and wealth and power was not wholly vanity but was, in part at
                        least, <pb id="VAA2369-331" n="326"/> due to a feeling that love was the
                        only essential. Nor did he wonder how she was reconciling this belief of
                        high and pure sentiment with what she was doing in marrying him. He knew
                        that human beings are not consistent, cannot be so in a universe that
                        compels them to face directly opposite conditions often in the same moment.
                        But just as all lines are parallel in infinity, so all actions are
                        profoundly consistent when referred to the infinitely broad standard of the
                        necessity that every living thing shall look primarily to its own well
                        being. Disobedience to this fundamental carries with it inevitable
                        punishment of disintegration and death; and those catastrophes are serious
                        matters when one has but the single chance at life, that will be repeated
                        never again in all the eternities.</p>
                    <p>After their late lunch or early dinner, they drove to her lodgings. He went
                        up with her and helped her to packnot a long process, as she had few
                        belongings. He noted that the stockings and underclothes she took from the
                        bureau drawers were in anything but good condition, that the half dozen
                        dresses she took from the closet and folded on the couch were about done
                        for. Presently she said, cheerfully and with no trace of false shame:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You see, I&apos;m pretty nearly in rags.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, that&apos;s soon arranged,&quot; replied he.
                        &quot;Why bother to take these things? Why not give them to the
                        maid?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-332" n="327"/>
                    <p>She debated with herself. &quot;I think you&apos;re right,&quot;
                        she decided. &quot;Yes, I&apos;ll give them to Jennie.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The underclothes, too,&quot; he urged. &quot;And the
                        hats.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It ended in her having left barely enough loosely to fill the bottom of a
                        small trunk with two trays.</p>
                    <p>They drove to the Knickerbocker Hotel, and he took a small suite, one of the
                        smallest and least luxurious in the house, for with all his desire to make
                        her feel the contrast of her change of circumstances sharply, he could not
                        forget how limited his income was, and how unwise it would be to have to
                        move in a few days to humbler quarters. He hoped that the rooms, englamoured
                        by the hotel&apos;s general air of costly luxury, would sufficiently
                        impress her. And while she gave no strong indication but accepted everything
                        in her wonted quiet, passive manner, he was shrewd enough to see that she
                        was content. &quot;To-morrow,&quot; he said to himself,
                        &quot;after she has done some shopping, the last regret will leave her,
                        and her memory of that clerk will begin to fade fast. I&apos;ll give her
                        too much else to think about.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The following morning, when they faced each other at breakfast in their
                        sitting room, he glanced at her from time to time in wonder and terror. She
                        looked not merely insignificant, but positively homely. Her skin had a
                        sickly pallor; her hair seemed to be of many different and disagreeable
                        shades of uninteresting dead <pb id="VAA2369-333" n="328"/> yellow. Her eyes
                        suggested faded blue china dishes, with colorless lashes and reddened edges
                        of the lids. Her lips had lost their rosy freshness, her teeth their
                        sparkling whiteness.</p>
                    <p>His heavy heart seemed to be resting nauseously upon the pit of his stomach.
                        Was his infatuation sheer delusion, with no basis of charm in her at all?
                        Was she, indeed, nothing but this unattractive, faded little
                        commonplaceness?a poor specimen of an inferior order of working girl? What
                        an awakening! And she was his <hi rend="i">wife</hi>!was his companion for
                        the yet more brilliant career he had resolved and was planning! He must
                        introduce her everywhere, must see the not to be concealed amazement in the
                        faces of his acquaintances, must feel the cruel covert laughter and jeering
                        at his weak folly! Was there ever in history or romance a parallel to such
                        fatuity as his? Why, people would be right in thinking him a sham, a mere
                        bluffer at the high and strong qualities he was reputed to have.</p>
                    <p>Had Norman been, in fact, the man of ice and iron the compulsions of a career
                        under the social system made him seem, the homely girl opposite him that
                        morning would speedily have had something to think about other than her
                        unhappiness of the woman who has given her person to one man and her heart
                        to another. Instead, the few words he addressed to her were all gentleness
                        and forbearance. Stronger than his chagrin was his pity for herthe poor,
                        unconscious victim of his mad hallucination. <pb id="VAA2369-334" n="329"/>
                        If she thought about the matter at all, she assumed that he was still the
                        slave of her charmsfor, the florid enthusiasm of man&apos;s passion
                        inevitably deludes the woman into fancying it objective instead of wholly
                        subjective; and, only the rare very wise woman, after much experience,
                        learns to be suspicious of the validity of her own charms and to concentrate
                        upon keeping up the man&apos;s delusions.</p>
                    <p>At last he rose and kissed her on the brow and let his hand rest gently on
                        her shoulderwhat a difference between those caresses and the caresses that
                        had made her beg him to be &quot;kind&quot; to her! Said he:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you mind if I leave you alone for a while? I ought to go to the
                        club and have the rest of my things packed and sent. I&apos;ll not be
                        gone longabout an hour.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said she lifelessly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll telephone my office that I&apos;ll not be down
                        to-day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With an effort she said, &quot;There&apos;s no reason for doing that.
                        I don&apos;t want to interfere with your business.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m neglecting nothing. And that shopping must be
                        done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She made no reply, but went to the window, and from the height looked down
                        and out upon the mighty spread of the city. He observed her a moment with a
                        dazed pitying expression, took his hat and departed.</p>
                    <p>It was nearly two hours before he got together sufficient <pb
                            id="VAA2369-335" n="330"/> courage to return. He had been hopinghad been
                        saying to himself with vigorous effort at confidencethat he had simply seen
                        one more of the many transformations, each of which seemed to present her as
                        a wholly different personality. When he should see her again, she would have
                        wiped out the personality that had shocked and saddened him, would appear as
                        some new variety of enchantress, perhaps even more potent over his senses
                        than ever before. But a glance as he entered demolished that hope. She was
                        no different than when he left. Evidently she had been crying, and spasms of
                        that sort always accentuate every unloveliness. He did not try to nerve
                        himself to kiss her, but said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;ll not take you long to get ready?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She moved to rise from her languid rest upon the sofa. She sank back.
                        &quot;Perhaps we&apos;d better not go to-day,&quot; suggested
                        she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you feel well?&quot; he asked, and his tone was
                        more sympathetic than it would have been had his sympathy been genuine.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not very,&quot; replied she, with a faint deprecating smile.
                        &quot;And not verynot very&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not very what?&quot; she said, in a tone of encouragement.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not very happy,&quot; she confessed. &quot;I&apos;m
                        afraid I&apos;ve made aa dreadful mistake.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her in silence. She could have said <pb id="VAA2369-336" n="331"
                        /> nothing that would have caused a livelier response within himself. His
                        cynicism noted the fact that while he had mercifully concealed his
                        discontent, she was thinking only of herself. But he did not blame her. It
                        was only the familiar habit of the sex, bred of man&apos;s assiduous
                        cultivation of its egotism. He said: &quot;Oh, you&apos;ll feel
                        differently about it later. Let&apos;s get some fresh air and see what
                        the shops have to offer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A pause, then she, timidly: &quot;Would you mind very much if Iif I
                        didn&apos;tgo on?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean, if you left me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She nodded without looking at him. He could not understand himself, but as he
                        sat observing her, so young, so inexperienced and so undesirable, a pity of
                        which he would not have dreamed his nature capable welled up in him, choking
                        his throat with sobs he could scarcely restrain and filling his eyes with
                        tears he had secretly to wipe away. And he felt himself seized of a sense of
                        responsibility for her as strong in its solemn, still way as any of the
                        paroxysms of his passion had been.</p>
                    <p>He said: &quot;My dearyou mustn&apos;t decide anything so important
                        to you in a hurry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A tremor passed over her, and he thought she was going to dissolve in
                        hysterics. Hut she exhibited once more that marvelous and mysterious
                        self-control, whose secret had interested and baffled him. She said in her
                        dim, quiet way:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-337" n="332"/>
                    <p>&quot;It seems to me I just can&apos;t stay on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can always go, you know. &quot;Why not try it a few
                        days?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He could feel the trend of her thoughts, and in the way things often amuse us
                        without in the least moving us to wish to laugh, he was amused by noting
                        that she was trying to bring herself to stay on, out of consideration for
                            <hi rend="i">his</hi> feelings! He said with a kind of paternal
                        tenderness:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whenever you want to go, I am willing to arrange things for youso
                        that you needn&apos;t worry about money. But I feel that, as I am older
                        than you, I ought to do all I can to keep you from making a mistake you
                        might soon regret.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She studied him dubiously. He saw that shenaturally enoughdid not believe in
                        his disinterestedness, that she hadn&apos;t a suspicion of his change,
                        or, rather collapse, of feeling. She said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you ask it, I&apos;ll stay a while. But you must promise
                        toto be kind to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was only gentleness in his smile. But what a depth of satirical
                        self-mockery and amusement at her innocent young egotism it concealed!
                        &quot;You&apos;ll never have reason to speak of that again, my
                        dear,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Icantrust you?&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Absolutely,&quot; replied he. &quot;I&apos;ll have
                        another room opened into this suite. Would you like that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If youif you don&apos;t mind.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-338" n="[333]"/>
                    <p>He stood up with sudden boyish buoyance. &quot;Nowlet&apos;s go
                        shopping. Let&apos;s amuse ourselves.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She rose with alacrity. She eyed him uncertainly, then flung her arms round
                        his neck and kissed him. &quot;You are <hi rend="i">so</hi> good to
                        me!&quot; she cried. &quot;And I&apos;m not a bit
                        nice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He did not try to detain her, but sent her to finish dressing, with an
                        encouraging pat on the shoulder and a cheerful, &quot;Don&apos;t
                        worry about yourselfor me.&quot;</p>

                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">BOUT</hi> half an hour later the door into the bedroom opened
                        and she appeared on the threshold of the sitting room, ready for the street.
                        He stared at her in the dazed amazement of a man faced by the impossible,
                        and uncertain whether it is sight or reason that is tricking him. She had
                        gone into the bedroom not only homely but commonplace, not only commonplace
                        but common, a dingy washed-out blonde girl whom it would be a humiliation to
                        present as his wife. She was standing there, in the majesty of such proud
                        pale beauty as poets delight to ascribe to a sorrowful princess. Her
                        wonderful skin was clear and translucent, giving her an ethereal look. Her
                        hair reminded him again of what marvels he had seen in the sunlight of
                        Sunday afternoon. And looking at her form and the small head so gracefully
                        capping it, he could think only of the simile that had always come to him in
                        his moments of ecstasythe lily on its tall stem.</p>
                    <p>And once more, like a torrent, the old infatuation sprang from its dried
                        sources and came rushing and overwhelming through vein and nerve.
                        &quot;Am I mad <pb id="VAA2369-340" n="335"/> now?was I mad a few
                        moments ago?is it she or is it my own disordered senses?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was drawing on her gloves, was unconscious of his confusion. He
                        controlled himself and said: &quot;You have a most disconcerting way of
                        changing your appearance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She glanced down at her costume. &quot;No, it&apos;s the same dress.
                        I&apos;ve only the one, you know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He longed to take her in his arms, but could not trust himself. And this
                        wonder-girl, his very own, was talking of leaving him! And henot an hour
                        beforehe, apparently in his right senses had been tolerating such
                        preposterous talk! Give her up? Never! He must see to it that the subject
                        did not find excuse for intruding again. &quot;Ihave frightened herhave
                        disgusted her. I must restrain myself. I must be patientand teach her
                        slowlyand win her gradually.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They spent an interesting and even exciting afternoon, driving from shop to
                        shop and selecting the first beginnings of her wardrobe. He had only about
                        three hundred dollars. Some of the things they ordered were ready for
                        delivery, and so had to be paid for at once. When they returned to the hotel
                        he had but fifty dollars leftand had contracted debts that made it necessary
                        for him to raise at least a thousand dollars within a week. He saw that his
                        freedom with sums of money which terrified her filled her with awe and
                        admirationand that he was already more successful than he had expected to
                            <pb id="VAA2369-341" n="336"/> be, in increasing her hesitation about
                        leaving him. Among the things they had bought were a simple black chiffon
                        dress and a big plumed black hat to match. These needed no alterations and
                        were delivered soon after they returned. Some silk stockings came also and a
                        pair of slippers bought for the dinner toilet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can dress to-night,&quot; said he, &quot;and
                        I&apos;ll take you to Sherry&apos;s, and to the theater
                        afterwards.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was delighted. At last she was going to look like the women of whom she
                        had been dreaming these last few months. She set about dressing herself, he
                        waiting in the sitting room in a state of acute nervousness. What would be
                        the effect of such a toilet? Would she look like a ladyor likewhat she had
                        suggested that morning? She was so changeable, had such a wide range of
                        variability that he dared not hope. When she finally appeared, he was ready
                        to fall down and worship. He was about to take her where his world would see
                        her, where every inch of her would be subjected to the cruelest, most
                        hostile criticism. One glance at her, and he knew a triumph awaited him. No
                        man and no woman would wonder that he had lost his head over such beauty as
                        hers. Hat and dress seemed just what had been needed to bring out the full
                        glory of her charms.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are incredibly beautiful,&quot; he said in an awed tone.
                        &quot;I am proud of you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A little color came into her cheeks. She looked at herself in the mirror with
                        her quiet intense secret, yet <pb id="VAA2369-342" n="337"/> not covert
                        vanity. He laughed in boyish pleasure. &quot;This is only the small
                        beginning,&quot; said he. &quot;Wait a few months.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At dinner and in a box at the theater afterwards, he had the most exquisite
                        pleasure of his life. She had been seen by many of his former friends, and
                        he was certain they knew who she was. He felt that he would have no
                        difficulty in putting her in the place his wife should occupy. A woman with
                        such beauty as hers was a sensation, one fashionable society would not deny
                        itself. She had good manners, an admirable manner. With a little coaching
                        she would be as much at home in grandeur as were those who had always had
                        it.</p>
                    <p>The last fear of losing her left him. On the way back to the hotel he, in a
                        delirium of pride and passion, crushed her in his arms and caressed her with
                        the frenzy that had always terrified her. She resisted only faintly, was
                        almost passive. &quot;She is mine!&quot; he said to himself,
                        exultantly. &quot;She is really mine!&quot;</p>
                    <p>When he awoke in the morning she was still asleeplooked like a tired lovely
                        child. Several times, while he was dressing, he went in to feast his eyes
                        upon her beauty. How could he possibly have thought her homely, in whatever
                        moment of less beauty or charm she might have had? The crowning charm of
                        infinite variety! She had a delightfully sweet disposition. He was not sure
                        how much or how little intelligence she <pb id="VAA2369-343" n="338"/>
                        hadprobably more than most women. But what did that matter? It would be
                        impossible ever to grow weary or to be anything but infatuated lover when
                        she had such changeful beauty.</p>
                    <p>He kissed her lightly on her thick braids, as he was about to go. He left a
                        note explaining that he did not wish to disturb her and that it was
                        necessary for him to be at the office earlier. And that morning in all New
                        York no man left his home for the day&apos;s struggle for dollars with a
                        freer or happier heart, or readier to play the game boldly, skillfully, with
                        success.</p>
                    <p>Certainly he needed all his courage and all his skill.</p>
                    <p>To most of the people who live in New York and elsewhere throughout the
                        countryor the world, for that matteran income of a thousand dollars a month
                        seems extremely comfortable, to say the least of it. The average American
                        family of five has to scrape along on about half that sum a year. But among
                        the comfortable classes in New Yorkand perhaps in one or two other citiesa
                        thousand dollars a month is literally genteel poverty. To people accustomed
                        to what is called luxury nowadayspeople with the habit of the private
                        carriage, the private automobile, and several servantsto such people a
                        thousand dollars a month is an absurd little sum. It would not pay for the
                        food alone. It would not buy for a man and his wife, with no children,
                        clothing enough to enable them to make a decent appearance.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-344" n="339"/>
                    <p>Norman, living alone and living very quietly indeed, might have got along for
                        a while on that sum, if he had taken much thought about expenditures, had
                        persisted in such severe economies as using street cars instead of taxicabs
                        and drinking whisky at dinner instead of his customary quart of six-dollar
                        champagne. Norman, the married man, could not escape disaster for a single
                        month on an income so pitiful.</p>
                    <p>Probably on the morning on which he set out for downtown in search of money
                        enough to enable him to live decently, not less than ten thousand men on
                        Manhattan Island left comfortable or luxurious homes faced with precisely
                        the same problem. And each and every one of them knew that on that day or
                        some day soon they must find the money demanded imperiously by their own and
                        their families&apos; tastes and necessities or be ruinedflung out,
                        trampled upon, derided as failures, hated by the &quot;loved
                        ones&quot; they had caused to be humiliated. And every man of that
                        legion had a fine, an unusually fine brainresourceful, incessant, teeming
                        with schemes for wresting from those who had dollars the dollars they dared
                        not go home without. And those ten thousand quickest and most energetic
                        brains, by their mode of thought and action, determined the thought and
                        action of the entire countrygave the mercenary and unscrupulous cast to the
                        whole social system. Themselves the victims of conditions, they were the
                        bellwethers to millions of victims compelled to follow their leadership.</p>

                    <p>Norman, by the roundabout mode of communication he and Tetlow had
                        established, summoned his friend and backer to his office.

                        got to have more money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How much?&quot; said Tetlow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;More than you can afford to advance me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How much?&quot; repeated Tetlow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Three thousand a month right awayat the least.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s a big sum,&quot; said Tetlow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, for a man used to dealing in small figures. But in reality
                        it&apos;s a moderate income.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Few large families spend more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Few large or small families in my part of New York pinch along on
                        so little.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What has happened to you?&quot; said Tetlow, dropping into a
                        chair and folding his fat hands on his stomach.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot; asked Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s in your voicein your facein your cool demand for a
                        big income.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s start right, old man,&quot; said Norman.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t <hi rend="i">call</hi> thirty-six thousand a year
                        big or you&apos;ll <hi rend="i">think</hi> it big. And if you think it
                        big, you will stay little.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow nodded. &quot;I&apos;m ready to grow,&quot; said he
                        &quot;Now what&apos;s happened to you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve got married,&quot; replied Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought so. To MissHallowell?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-346" n="341"/>
                    <p>&quot;To Miss Hallowell. So my way&apos;s clear, and I&apos;m
                        going to resume the march.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve two plans. Either will serve. The first is yoursthe
                        one you partly revealed to me the other day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Partly?&quot; said Tetlow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Partly,&quot; repeated Norman, laughing. &quot;I know you,
                        Billy, and that means I know you&apos;re absolutely incapable of
                        plotting as big a scheme as you suggested to me. It came either from
                        Galloway or from some one of his clique.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I said all I&apos;m at liberty to say, Fred.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t wish you to break your promise. All I want to know
                        is, can I get the three thousand a month and assurance of its lasting and
                        leading to something bigger?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is your other scheme?&quot; said Tetlow, and it was plain
                        to the shrewder young lawyer that the less shrewd young lawyer wished to
                        gain time.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Simple and sure,&quot; replied Norman. &quot;We will buy
                        ten shares of Universal Fuel Company through a dummy and bring suit to
                        dissolve it. I looked into the matter for Burroughs once when he was after
                        the Fosdick-Langdon group. Universal Fuel wouldn&apos;t dare defend the
                        action I could bring. We could get what we pleased for our ten shares to let
                        up on the suit. The moment their lawyers saw the papers I&apos;d draw,
                        they&apos;d advise it.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-347" n="342"/>
                    <p>Tetlow shook his large, impressively molded head. &quot;Shady,&quot;
                        said he. &quot;Shady.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman smiled with good-natured patience. &quot;You sound like Burroughs
                        or Galloway when they are denouncing a man for trying to get rich by the
                        same methods they pursued. My dear Bill, don&apos;t be one of those
                        lawyers who will do the queer work for a client but not for themselves.
                        There&apos;s no sense, no morality, no intelligent hypocrisy even, in
                        that. We didn&apos;t create the commercial morality of the present day.
                        For God&apos;s sake, let&apos;s not be of the poor fools who
                        practice it but get none of its benefits.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow shifted uneasily. &quot;I don&apos;t like to hear that sort of
                        thing,&quot; said he, apologetic and nervous.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it true?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. Butdamn it, I don&apos;t like to hear it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is to say, you&apos;re willing to pay the price of
                        remaining small and obscure just for the pleasure of indulging in a wretched
                        hypocrisy of a self-deception. Bill, come out of the small class. Whether
                        you go in with me or not, come out of the class of understrappers.
                        What&apos;s the difference between the big men and their little
                        followers? Why, the big men <hi rend="i">see.</hi> They don&apos;t
                        deceive themselves with the cant they pour out for the benefit of the
                        ignorant mob.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow was listening like a pupil to a teacher. That was always his attitude
                        toward Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The big men,&quot; continued Norman, &quot;know that <pb
                            id="VAA2369-348" n="343"/> canting is necessarythat one must always
                        profess high and disinterested motives, and so on, and so on. But they
                        don&apos;t let their hypocritical talk influence their actions. How is
                        it with the little fellows? Why, they believe the flapdoodle the leaders
                        talk. They go into the enterprise, do all the small dirty work, lie and
                        cheat and steal, and hand over the proceeds to the big fellows, for the sake
                        of a pat on the back and a noisy &apos;Honest fellow! Here are a few
                        crumbs for you.&apos; And crumbs are all that a weak, silly,
                        hypocritical fool deserves. Can you deny it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No doubt you&apos;re right, Fred,&quot; conceded Tetlow.
                        &quot;But I&apos;m afraid I haven&apos;t the nerve.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come in behind me. I&apos;ve got nerve for two<hi rend="i"
                        >now</hi>!&quot;</p>
                    <p>At that triumphant &quot;now&quot; Tetlow looked curiously at his
                        friend. &quot;Yes, <hi rend="i">it</hi> has changed youchanged you back
                        to what you were. I don&apos;t understand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It isn&apos;t necessary that you understand,&quot; rejoined
                        Norman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think you could really carry through that scheme
                        you&apos;ve just outlined?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see it fascinates you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve no objection to rising to the class of big
                        men,&quot; said Tetlow. &quot;But aren&apos;t you letting your
                        confidence in yourself deceive you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did I ever let it deceive me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; confessed Tetlow. &quot;I&apos;ve often
                        watched you, <pb id="VAA2369-349" n="344"/> and thought you&apos;d fall
                        through it, or stumble at least. But you never did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And shall I tell you why? Because I use my self-confidence and my
                        hopefulness and all my optimistic qualities only to create an atmosphere of
                        success. But when it comes to planning a move of any kind, when I assemble
                        my lieutenants round the council board in my brain, I never permit a single
                        cheerful one to speak, or even to enter. It&apos;s a serious, gloomy
                        circle of faces, Bill.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow nodded reminiscently. &quot;Yes, you always were like that,
                        Fred.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And the one who does the most talking at my council is the
                        gloomiest of all. He&apos;s Lieutenant Flaw-picker. He can&apos;t
                        see any hope for anything. He sees all the possibilities of failure. He sees
                        all the chances against success. And what&apos;s the result? Why, when
                        the council rises it has taken out of the plan every chance of mishap that
                        my intelligence could foreseeand it has provided not one but several safe
                        lines of orderly retreat in case success proves impossible.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow gazed at Norman in worshipful admiration. &quot;What a brain! What
                        a mind!&quot; he ejaculated. &quot;And to think that <hi rend="i"
                            >you</hi> could be upset by a <hi rend="i">woman</hi>!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman leaned back in his chair smiling broadly. &quot;Not by a
                        woman,&quot; he corrected. &quot;By a girlan inexperienced girl of
                        twenty.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It seems incredible.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-350" n="345"/>
                    <p>&quot;A grain of dust, dropped into a watch movement in just the right
                        placeyou know what happens.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow nodded. Then, with a sharp, anxious look, &quot;But it&apos;s
                        all over?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman hesitated. &quot;I believe so,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Tetlow rose and rubbed his thighs. He had been sitting long in the same
                        position, and he was now stout enough to suffer from fat man&apos;s
                        cramp. &quot;Well,&quot; said he, &quot;we needn&apos;t
                        bother about that Universal Fuel scheme at present. I can guarantee you the
                        three thousand dollars, and the other things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman shook his head. &quot;Not enough,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You want more money?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. But I will not work, or rather, wait, in the dark. Tell your
                        principals that I must be let in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow hesitated, walking about the office. Finally he said, &quot;Look
                        here, Fredyou think I deceived you the other dayposed as your friend when in
                        reality I was simply acting as agent for people who wanted you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman gave Tetlow a look that made him redden with pleasure. &quot;No, I
                        don&apos;t, old man,&quot; said he. &quot;I know you recommended
                        meand that they were shy of me because of the way I&apos;ve been
                        actingand that you stood sponsor for me. Isn&apos;t that
                        right?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Something like that,&quot; admitted Tetlow. &quot;But they
                        were eager to get you. It was only a question of trusting you. I was able to
                        do you a good turn there.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-351" n="346"/>
                    <p>&quot;And I&apos;ll make a rich man, and a famous one, of
                        you,&quot; said Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. I believe you will,&quot; cried Tetlow, tears in his
                        prominent studious eyes. &quot;I&apos;ll see those people in a day
                        or two, and let you know. Do you need money right away? Of course you
                        do.&quot; And down he sat and drew a check for fifteen hundred dollars.</p>
                    <p>Norman laughed as he glanced to see if it was correctly drawn.
                        &quot;I&apos;d not have dared return to my bride with empty pockets.
                        That&apos;s what it means to live in New York.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow grinned. &quot;A sentimental town, isn&apos;t it? Especially
                        the women.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t blame them,&quot; said Norman.
                        &quot;They need the money, and the only way they&apos;ve got of
                        making it is out of sentiment. And you must admit they give a bully good
                        quality, if the payment is all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow shrugged his shoulders. &quot;I&apos;m glad I don&apos;t
                        need them,&quot; said he. &quot;It gives me the creeps to see them
                        gliding about with their beautiful dresses and their sweet, soft
                        faces.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He and Norman lunched together in an out-of-the-way restaurant. After a busy
                        and a happy afternoon, Norman returned early to the hotel. He had cashed his
                        check. He was in funds. He would give her another and more thrilling taste
                        of the joy that was to be hers through himand soon she would be giving even
                        as she gotfor he would teach her not to fear <pb id="VAA2369-352" n="[347]"
                        /> love, not to shrink from it, but to rejoice in it and to let it permeate
                        and complete all her charms.</p>
                    <p>He ascended to the apartment and knocked. There was no answer. He searched in
                        vain for a chambermaid to let him in. He descended to the office.
                        &quot;Oh, Mr. Norman,&quot; said one of the clerks. &quot;Your
                        wife left this note for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman took it. &quot;She went out?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;About three o&apos;clockwith a young gentleman who called on
                        her. They came back a while ago and she left the note.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Norman. He took his key, went up to the
                        apartment. Not until he had closed and locked the door did he open the note.
                        He read: <q direct="unspecified">
                            <p>&quot;Last night you broke your promise. So I am going away.
                                Don&apos;t look for me. It won&apos;t be any use. When I
                                decide what to do I&apos;ll send you word.&quot;</p>
                        </q>
                    </p>
                    <p>He was standing at the table. He tossed the note on the marble, threw open
                        the bedroom door. The black chiffon dress, the big plumed hat, and all the
                        other articles they had bought were spread upon the bed, arranged with the
                        obvious intention that he should see at a glance she had taken nothing away
                        with her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hell!&quot; he said aloud. &quot;Why didn&apos;t I let
                        her go yesterday morning?&quot;</p>

                    <p>A <hi rend="sc">FEW</hi> days later, Tetlow, having business with Norman,
                        tried to reach him by telephone. After several failures he went to the
                        hotel, and in the bar learned enough to enable him to guess that Norman was
                        off on a mad carouse. He had no difficulty in finding the trail or in
                        following it; the difficulty lay in catching up, for Norman was going fast.
                        Not until late at nightthat is, early in the morningof the sixth day from
                        the beginning of his search did he get his man.</p>
                    <p>He was prepared to find a wreck, haggard, wildly nervous and disreputably
                        disheveled; for, so far as he could ascertain Norman had not been to bed,
                        but had gone on and on from one crowd of revelers to another, in a city
                        where it is easy to find companions in dissipation at any hour of the
                        twenty-four. Tetlow was even calculating upon having to put off their
                        business many weeks while the crazy man was pulling through delirium tremens
                        or some other form of brain fever.</p>
                    <p>An astonishing sight met his eyes in the Third Avenue oyster house before
                        which the touring car Norman had been using was drawn up. At a long table,
                        eating oysters as fast as the opener could work, sat <pb id="VAA2369-354"
                            n="349"/> Norman and his friend Gaskill, a fellow member of the Federal
                        Club, and about a score of broken and battered tramps. The supper or
                        breakfast was going forward in admirable order. Gaskill, whom Norman had
                        picked up a few hours before, showed signs of having done some drinking. But
                        not Norman. It is true his clothing might have looked fresher; but hardly
                        the man himself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just in time!&quot; he cried out genially, at sight of Tetlow.
                        &quot;Sit down with us. Waiter, a chair next to mine. Gentlemen, Mr.
                        Tetlow. Mr. Tetlow, gentlemen. What&apos;ll you have, old man?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow declined champagne, accepted half a dozen of the huge oysters.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve been after you for nearly a week,&quot; said he
                        to Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pity you weren&apos;t <hi rend="i">with</hi> me,&quot; said
                        Norman. &quot;I&apos;ve been getting acquainted with large numbers
                        of my fellow citizens.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;From the Bowery to Yonkers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Exactly. Don&apos;t fall asleep, Gaskill.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Gaskill was snoring with his head on the back of his chair and his throat
                        presented as if for the ax of the executioner. &quot;He&apos;s all
                        in,&quot; said Tetlow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the way it goes,&quot; complained Norman.
                        &quot;I can&apos;t find anyone to keep me company.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow laughed. &quot;You look as if you had just started out,&quot;
                        said he. &quot;Tell me<hi rend="i">where</hi> have you slept?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-355" n="350"/>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t had time to sleep as yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I dropped in to suggest that a little sleep wouldn&apos;t do
                        any harm.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not quite yet. Watch our friends eat. It gives me an appetite.
                        Waiter, another dozen all roundand some more of this carbonated white wine
                        you&apos;ve labeled champagne.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As he called out this order, a grunt of satisfaction ran round the row of
                        human derelicts. Tetlow shuddered, yet was moved and thrilled, too, as he
                        glanced from face to facethose hideous hairy countenances, begrimed and
                        beslimed, each countenance expressing in its own repulsive way the one
                        emotion of gratified longing for food and drink. &quot;Where did you get
                        &apos;em?&quot; inquired he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;From the benches in Madison Square,&quot; replied Norman. He
                        laughed queerly. &quot;Recognize yourself in any of those mugs,
                        Tetlow?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>Tetlow shivered. &quot;I should say not!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>Norman&apos;s eyes gleamed. &quot;I see myself in all of
                        &apos;em,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Poor wretches!&quot; muttered Tetlow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pity wasted,&quot; he rejoined. &quot;You might feel sorry
                        for a man on the way to where they&apos;ve got. But once arrivedas well
                        pity a dead man sleeping quietly in his box with three feet of solid earth
                        between him and worries of every kind.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-356" n="351"/>
                    <p>&quot;Shake this crowd,&quot; said Tetlow impatiently. &quot;I
                        want to talk with you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right, if it bores you.&quot; He sent the waiter out for
                        enough lodging-house tickets to provide for all. He distributed them
                        himself, to make sure that the proprietor of the restaurant did not attempt
                        to graft. Then he roused Gaskill and bundled him into the car and sent it
                        away to his address. The tramps gathered round and gave Norman three
                        cheersthey pressed close while four of them tried to pick his and
                        Tetlow&apos;s pockets. Norman knocked them away goodnaturedly, and he
                        and Tetlow climbed into Tetlow&apos;s hansom.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To my place,&quot; suggested Tetlow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, to minethe Knickerbocker,&quot; replied Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d rather you went to my place first,&quot; said
                        Tetlow uneasily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My wife isn&apos;t with me. She has left me,&quot; said
                        Norman calmly.</p>
                    <p>Tetlow hesitated, extremely nervous, finally acquiesced. They drove a while
                        in silence, then Norman said, &quot;What&apos;s the
                        business?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Galloway wants to see you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell him to come to my office to-morrowthat means to-dayat any time
                        after eleven.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But that gives you no chance to pull yourself together,&quot;
                        objected Tetlow.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-357" n="352"/>
                    <p>Norman&apos;s face, seen in the light of the street lamp they happened to
                        be passing, showed ironic amusement. &quot;Never mind about me, Billy.
                        Tell him to come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow cleared his throat nervously. &quot;Don&apos;t you think, old
                        man, that you&apos;d better go to see him? I&apos;ll arrange the
                        appointment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman said quietly: &quot;Tetlow, I&apos;ve dropped pretty far. But
                        not so far that I go to my clients. The rule of calls is that the man
                        seeking the favor goes to the man who can grant it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But it isn&apos;t the custom nowadays for a lawyer to deal that
                        way with a man like Galloway.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And neither is it the custom for anyone to have any self-respect.
                        Does Galloway need my brains more than I need his money, or do I need his
                        money more than he needs my brains? You know what the answer to that is,
                        Billy. We are partnersyou and I. I&apos;m training you for the
                        position.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Galloway won&apos;t come,&quot; said Tetlow curtly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So much the worse for him,&quot; retorted Norman placidly.
                        &quot;NoI&apos;ve not been drinking too much, old manas your
                        worried-old-maid look suggests. Do a little thinking. If Galloway
                        doesn&apos;t get me, whom will he get?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know very well, Norman, there are scores of lawyers, good ones,
                        who&apos;d crawl at his feet for his business. Nowadays, most lawyers
                        are always looking round for a pair of rich man&apos;s boots to
                        lick.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-358" n="353"/>
                    <p>&quot;But I am not &apos;most lawyers,&apos;&quot; said
                        Norman. &quot;Of course, if Galloway could make me come to him,
                        he&apos;d be a fool to come to me. But when he finds I&apos;m, not
                        coming, why, he&apos;ll behave himselfif his business is important
                        enough for me to bother with.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But if he doesn&apos;t come, Fred?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thenmy Universal Fuel scheme, or some other equally good. But you
                        will never see me limbering my knees in the anteroom of a rich man, when he
                        needs me and I don&apos;t need him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, we&apos;ll see,&quot; said Tetlow, with the air of a
                        sober man patient with one who is not sober.</p>
                    <p>&quot;By the way,&quot; continued Norman, &quot;if Galloway says
                        he&apos;s too ill to comeor anything of that sorttell him I&apos;d
                        not care to undertake the affairs of a man too old or too feeble to attend
                        to business, as he might die in the midst of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow&apos;s face was such a wondrous exhibit of discomfiture that
                        Norman laughed outright. Evidently he had forestalled his fat friend in a
                        scheme to get him to Galloway in spite of himself. &quot;All rightall
                        right,&quot; said Tetlow fretfully. &quot;We&apos;ll sleep on
                        this. But I don&apos;t see why you&apos;re so opposed to going to
                        see the man. It looks like snobbishness to mefalse pridesilly false
                        pride.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It <hi rend="i">is</hi> snobbishness,&quot; said Norman.
                        &quot;But you forget that snobbishness rules the world. The way to rule
                        fools is to make them respect you. And the way <pb id="VAA2369-359" n="354"
                        /> to make them respect you is by showing them that they are your inferiors.
                        I want Galloway&apos;s respect because I want his money. And
                        I&apos;ll not get his moneyas much of it as belongs to meexcept by
                        showing him my value. Not my value as a lawyer, for he knows that already,
                        but my value as a man. Do you see?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I don&apos;t,&quot; snapped Tetlow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s what it means to be Tetlow. Now, I do seeand
                        that&apos;s why I&apos;m Norman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow looked at him doubtfully, uncertain whether he had been listening to
                        wisdom put in a jocose form of audacious egotism or to the effervescings of
                        intoxication. The hint of a smile lurking in the sobriety of the powerful
                        features of his extraordinary friend only increased his doubt. Was Norman
                        mocking him, and himself as well? If so, was it the mockery of sober sense
                        or of drunkenness?</p>
                    <p>&quot;You seem to be puzzled, Billy,&quot; said Norman, and Tetlow
                        wondered how he had seen. &quot;Don&apos;t get your brains in a stew
                        trying to understand me. I&apos;m acting the way I&apos;ve always
                        actedexcept in one matter. You know that I know what I&apos;m
                        about?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I certainly do,&quot; replied his admirer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then, let it go at that. If you could understand methe sort of man
                        I am, the sort of thing I doyou&apos;d not need me, but would be the
                        whole show yourself eh? That being true, don&apos;t show yourself a
                        commonplace <pb id="VAA2369-360" n="355"/> nobody by deriding and denying
                        what your brain is unable to comprehend. Show yourself a somebody by seeing
                        the limitations of your ability. The world is full of little people who
                        criticise and judge and laugh at and misunderstand the few real
                        intelligences. And very tedious interruptions of the scenery those little
                        people are. Don&apos;t be one of them.... Did you know my
                        wife&apos;s father?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow startled. &quot;Nothat is, yes,&quot; he stammered.
                        &quot;That is, I met him a few times.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Often enough to find out that he was crazy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes. He explained some of his ideas to me. Yeshe was quite mad,
                        poor fellow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman gave way to a fit of silent laughter. &quot;I can
                        imagine,&quot; he presently said, &quot;what you&apos;d have
                        thought if Columbus or Alexander or Napoleon or Stevenson or even the chaps
                        who doped out the telephone and the telegraphif they had talked to you
                        before they arrived. Or even after they arrived, if they had been explaining
                        some still newer and bigger idea not yet accomplished.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t think Mr. Hallowell was mad?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He was mad, assuming that you are the standard of sanity.
                        Otherwise, he was a great man. There&apos;ll be statues erected and
                        pages of the book of fame devoted to the men who carry out his
                        ideas.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;His death was certainly a great loss to his daughter,&quot;
                        said Tetlow in his heaviest, most bourgeois manner.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-361" n="356"/>
                    <p>&quot;I said he was a great man,&quot; observed Norman. &quot;I
                        didn&apos;t say he was a great father. A great man is never a great
                        father. It takes a small man to be a great father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;At any rate, her having no parents or relatives doesn&apos;t
                        matter, now that she has you,&quot; said Tetlow, his manner at once
                        forced and constrained.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Um,&quot; muttered Norman.</p>
                    <p>Said Tetlow: &quot;Perhaps you misunderstood why I I acted as I did about
                        her, toward the last.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was of no importance,&quot; said Norman brusquely.
                        &quot;I wish to hear nothing about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I must explain, Fred. She piqued me by showing so plainly that
                        she despised me. I must admit the truth, though I&apos;ve got as much
                        vanity as the next man, and don&apos;t like to admit it. She despised
                        me, and it made me mad.&quot;</p>
                    <p>An expression of grim satire passed over Norman&apos;s face. Said he:
                        &quot;She despised me, too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, she did,&quot; said Tetlow. &quot;And both of us were
                        certainly greatly her superiorsin every substantial way. It seemed to me
                        mostmost&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Most impertinent of her?&quot; suggested Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Precisely. <hi rend="i">Most</hi> impertinent.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rather say, ignorant and small. My dear Tetlow, let me tell you
                        something. Anybody, however insignificant, can be loved. To be loved means
                        nothing, except possibly a hallucination in the brain of the lover.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-362" n="357"/>
                    <p>But to <hi rend="i">love</hi>that&apos;s another matter. Only a great
                        soul is capable of a great love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is true,&quot; murmured Tetlow sentimentally, preening in
                        a quiet, gentle way.</p>
                    <p>Said Norman sententiously: &quot;<hi rend="i">You</hi> stopped loving. It
                        was <hi rend="i">I</hi> that kept on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow looked uncomfortable. &quot;Yesyes,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;But we were talking of herof her not appreciating the love she
                        got. And I was about to say&quot; Earnestly&quot;Fred,
                        she&apos;s not to be blamed for her folly! She&apos;s very, very
                        youngand has all the weaknesses and vanities of youth&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here we are,&quot; interrupted Norman.</p>
                    <p>The hansom had stopped in Forty-second Street before the deserted but still
                        brilliantly lighted entrances to the great hotel. Norman sprang out so
                        lightly and surely that Tetlow wondered how it was possible for this to be
                        the man who had been racketing and roistering day after day, night after
                        night for nearly a week. He helped the heavy and awkward Tetlow to descend,
                        said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll have to pay, Bill. I&apos;ve got less than a
                        dollar left. And I touched Gaskill for a hundred and fifty to-night. You can
                        imagine how drunk he was, to let me have it. How they&apos;ve been
                        shying off from <hi rend="i">me</hi> these last few months!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you want <hi rend="i">Galloway</hi> to come to <hi rend="i"
                        >you</hi>,&quot; thrust Tetlow, as he counted out the money.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-363" n="358"/>
                    <p>Don&apos;t go back and chew on that,&quot; laughed Norman.
                        &quot;It&apos;s settled.&quot; He took the money, gave it to the
                        driver. &quot;Thanks,&quot; he said to Tetlow.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll pay you to-morrowthat is, later to-daywhen you send
                        me another check.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why should you pay for my cab?&quot; rejoined Tetlow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because it&apos;s easier for me to make money than it is for
                        you,&quot; replied Norman. &quot;If you were in my positionthe
                        position I&apos;ve been in for monthswould anybody on earth give you
                        three thousand dollars a month?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow looked sour. His good nature was rubbing thin in spots.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t lose your temper,&quot; laughed Norman.
                        &quot;I&apos;m pounding away at you about my superiority partly
                        because I&apos;ve been drinking, but chiefly for your own goodso that
                        you&apos;ll realize I&apos;m right and not mess things with
                        Galloway.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They went up to Norman&apos;s suite. Norman tried to unlock the door,
                        found it already unlocked. He turned the knob, threw the door wide for
                        Tetlow to enter first. Then, over Tetlow&apos;s shoulder he saw on the
                        marbletopped center table Dorothy&apos;s hat and jacket, the one she had
                        worn away, the only one she had. He stared at them, then at Tetlow. A
                        confused look in the fat, slow face made him say sharply:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What does this mean, Tetlow?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-364" n="359"/>
                    <p>&quot;Not so loud, Fred,&quot; said Tetlow, closing the door into the
                        public hall. &quot;She&apos;s in the bedroomprobably asleep.
                        She&apos;s been here since yesterday.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You brought her back?&quot; demanded Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She wanted to come. I simply&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman made a silencing gesture. Tetlow&apos;s faltering voice stopped
                        short. Norman stood near the table, his hands deep in his trousers&apos;
                        pockets, his gaze fixed upon the hat and jacket. When Tetlow&apos;s
                        agitation could bear the uncertainties of that silence no longer, he went
                        on:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fred, you mustn&apos;t forget how young and inexperienced she
                        is. She&apos;s been foolish, but nothing more. She&apos;s as pure as
                        when she came into the world. And it&apos;s the truth that she wanted to
                        come back. I saw it as soon as I began to talk with her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you chattering about?&quot; said Norman fiercely.
                        &quot;Why did you meddle in my affairs? Why did you bring her
                        back?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I knew she needed you,&quot; pleaded Tetlow. &quot;Then,
                        tooI was afraid I knew how you acted before, and I thought you&apos;d
                        not get your gait again until you had her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman gave a short sardonic laugh. &quot;If you&apos;d only stop
                        trying to understand me!&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Tetlow was utterly confused. &quot;But, Fred, you don&apos;t
                        realizenot all,&quot; he cried imploringly. &quot;She discoveredshe
                        thinks, I believethat issheshe <pb id="VAA2369-365" n="360"/> that
                        probablythat in a few months you&apos;ll be something more than a
                        husbandand she something more than a wifethat youthatyou and she will be a
                        father and a mother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow&apos;s meaning slowly dawned on Norman. He seated himself in his
                        favorite attitude, legs sprawled, fingers interlaced behind his head.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wasn&apos;t I right to bring her backto tell her she
                        needn&apos;t fear to come?&quot; pleaded Tetlow.</p>
                    <p>Norman made no reply. After a brief silence he said: &quot;Well, good
                        night, old man. Come round to my office any time after ten.&quot; He
                        rose and gave Tetlow his hand. &quot;And arrange for Galloway whenever
                        you like. Good night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Tetlow hesitated. &quot;Fredyou&apos;ll not be harsh to
                        her?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>Norman smileda satirical smile, yet exquisitely gentle. &quot;If you <hi
                            rend="i">only</hi> wouldn&apos;t try to understand me,
                        Bill,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>When he was alone he sat lost in thought. At last he rang for a bell boy. And
                        when the boy came, he said: &quot;That door there&quot;indicating
                        one in the opposite wall of the sitting room&quot;what does it lead
                        into?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Another bedroom, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Unlock it, and tell them at the office I wish that room added to my
                        suite.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As soon as the additional bedroom was at his disposal, <pb id="VAA2369-366"
                            n="361"/> he went in and began to undress. When he had taken off coat
                        and waistcoat he paused to telephone to the office a call for eight
                        o&apos;clock. As he finished and hung up the receiver, a sound from the
                        direction of the sitting room made him glance in there. On the threshold of
                        the other bedroom stood his wife. She was in her nightgown; her hair, done
                        in a single thick braid, hung down across her bosom. There was in the room
                        and upon her childish loveliness the strange commingling of lights and
                        shadows that falls when the electricity is still on and the early morning
                        light is pushing in at the windows. They looked at each other in silence for
                        some time. If she was frightened or in the least embarrassed she did not
                        show it. She simply looked at him, while ever so slowly a smile dawneda
                        gleam in the eyes, a flutter round the lips, growing merrier and merrier. He
                        did not smile. He continued to regard her gravely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I heard you and Mr. Tetlow come in,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;Thenyou talked so longI fell asleep again. I only this minute
                        awakened.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, now you can go to sleep again,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I&apos;m not a bit sleepy. What are you doing in that
                        room?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She advanced toward his door. He stood aside. She peeped in. She was so close
                        to him that her nightgown brushed the bosom of his shirt. &quot;Another
                        bedroom!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Just like ours.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-367" n="362"/>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t wish to disturb you,&quot; said he, calm and
                        grave.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you wouldn&apos;t have been disturbing me,&quot;
                        protested she, leaning against the door frame, less than two feet away and
                        directly facing him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll stay on here,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>She gazed at him with great puzzled eyes. &quot;Aren&apos;t you glad
                        I&apos;m back?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said he with a polite smile. &quot;But I
                        must get some sleep.&quot; And he moved away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must let me tell you how I happened to go and why I
                        came&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please,&quot; he interrupted, looking at her with a piercing
                        though not in the least unfriendly expression that made her grow suddenly
                        pale and thoughtful. &quot;I do not wish to hear about itnot nownot
                        ever. Tetlow told me all that it&apos;s necessary for me to know. You
                        have come to stay, I assume?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesif&quot;her lip quivered&quot;if you&apos;ll let
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There can be no question of that,&quot; said he with the same
                        polite gravity he had maintained throughout.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You want me to leave you alone?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please. I need sleep badlyand I&apos;ve only three
                        hours.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You areangry with me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked placidly into her lovely, swimming eyes. &quot;Not in the
                        least.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But how can you help being? I acted dreadfully.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-368" n="[363]"/>
                    <p>He smiled gently. &quot;But you are backand the incident is
                        closed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked down at the carpet, her fingers playing with her braid, twisting
                        and untwisting its strands. He stood waiting to close the door. She said,
                        without lifting her eyessaid in a quiet, expressionless way, &quot;I
                        have killed your love?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll not trouble you any more,&quot; evaded he. And he
                        laid his hand significantly upon the knob.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t understand,&quot; she murmured. Then, with a
                        quick apologetic glance at him, &quot;But I&apos;m very
                        inconsiderate. You want to sleep. Good night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good night,&quot; said he, beginning to close the door.</p>
                    <p>She impulsively stood close before him, lifted her small white face, as if
                        for a kiss. &quot;Do you forgive me?&quot; she asked. &quot;I
                        was foolish. I didn&apos;t understandtill I went back. Thennothing was
                        the same. And I knew I wasn&apos;t fitted for that lifeand
                        didn&apos;t really care for himand&quot;</p>
                    <p>He kissed her on the brow. &quot;Don&apos;t agitate
                        yourself,&quot; said he. &quot;And we will never speak of this
                        again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shrank as if he had struck her. Her head drooped, and her shoulders. When
                        she was clear of the door, he quietly closed it.</p>

                        Norman&apos;s office. &quot;Galloway&apos;s coming at

                    <p>&quot;So you mulled over what I said and decided that I was not
                        altogether drunk?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wasn&apos;t sure of that,&quot; replied Tetlow.
                        &quot;But I was afraid you&apos;d be offended if I didn&apos;t
                        try to get him. He gave me no trouble at all. As soon as I told him
                        you&apos;d be glad to see him at your office, he astounded me by saying
                        he&apos;d come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He and I have had dealings,&quot; said Norman. &quot;He
                        understood at once. I always know my way when I&apos;m dealing with a
                        big man. It&apos;s only the little people that are muddled and complex.
                        I hope you&apos;ll not forget this lesson, Billy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shan&apos;t,&quot; promised Tetlow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We are to be partners,&quot; pursued Norman. &quot;We shall
                        be intimately associated for years. You&apos;ll save me a vast amount of
                        time and energy and yourself a vast amount of fuming and fretting, if
                        you&apos;ll simply accept what I say, without discussion. When I want
                        discussion I&apos;ll ask your advice.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-370" n="365"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m afraid you don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth
                        much,&quot; said Tetlow humbly, &quot;and I guess it
                        isn&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;On the contrary, invaluable,&quot; declared Norman with
                        flattering emphasis. &quot;Where you lack and I excel is in decision and
                        action. I&apos;ll often get you to tell me what ought to be done, and
                        then I&apos;ll make you do itwhich you&apos;d never dare, by
                        yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At eleven sharp Galloway came, looking as nearly like a dangerous old eagle
                        as a human being well could. Rapacious, merciless, tyrannical; a famous
                        philanthropist. Stingy to pettiness; a giver away of millions. Rigidly
                        honest, yet absolutely unscrupulous; faithful to the last letter of his
                        given word, yet so treacherous where his sly mind could nose out a way to
                        evade the spirit of his agreements that his name was a synonym for
                        unfaithfulness. An assiduous and groveling snob, yet so militantly
                        democratic that, unless his interest compelled, he would not employ any
                        member of the &quot;best families&quot; in any important capacity.
                        He seemed a bundle of contradictions. In fact he was profoundly consistent.
                        That is to say, he steadily pursued in every thought and act the
                        gratification of his two passionswealth and power. He lost no seen
                        opportunity, however shameful, to add to his fortune or to amuse himself
                        with the human race, which he regarded with the unpitying contempt
                        characteristic of every cold nature born or risen to success.</p>
                    <p>His theory of lifeand it is the theory that explains <pb id="VAA2369-371"
                            n="366"/> most great financial successes, however they may pretend or
                        believehis theory of life was that he did not need friends because the
                        friends of a strong man weaken and rob him, but that he did need enemies
                        because he could grow rich and powerful destroying and despoiling them. To
                        him friends suggested the birds living in a tree. They might make the tree
                        more romantic to the unthinking observer; but they in fact ate its budding
                        leaves and its fruit and rotted its bough joints with their filthy nests.</p>
                    <p>We Americans are probably nearest to children of any race in civilization.
                        The peculiar conditions of lifetheir almost Arcadian simplicityup to a
                        generation or so ago, gave us a false training in the study of human nature.
                        We believe what the good preacher, the novelist and the poet, all as
                        ignorant of life as nursery books, tell us about the human heart. We fancy
                        that in a social system modeled upon the cruel and immoral system of Nature,
                        success is to the good and kind. Life is like the pious story in the
                        Sunday-school library; evil is the exception and to practice the simple
                        virtues is to tread with sure step the highway to riches and fame. This sort
                        of ignorance is taught, is proclaimed, is apparently accepted throughout the
                        world. Literature and the drama, representing life as it is dreamed by
                        humanity, life as it perhaps may be some day, create an impression which
                        defies the plain daily and hourly mockings of experience. Because weak and
                        petty offenders <pb id="VAA2369-372" n="367"/> are often punished, the
                        universe is pictured as sternly enforcing the criminal codes enacted by
                        priests or lawyers. But, while all the world half inclines to this agreeable
                        mendacity about life, only in America of all civilization is the mendacity
                        accepted as gospel, and suspicion about it frowned upon as the heresy of
                        cynicism. So the Galloways prosper and are in high moral repute. Some day we
                        shall learn that a social system which is merely a slavish copy of
                        Nature&apos;s barbarous and wasteful sway of the survival of the
                        toughest could be and ought to be improved upon by the intelligence of the
                        human race. Some day we shall put Nature in its proper place as kindergarten
                        teacher, and drop it from godship and erect enlightened human understanding
                        instead. But that is a long way off. Meanwhile the Galloways will reign, and
                        will assure us that they won their success by the Decalogue and the Golden
                        Ruleand will be believed by all who seek to assure for themselves in advance
                        almost certain failure at material success in the arena of action.</p>
                    <p>But they will not be believed by men of ambition, pushing resolutely for
                        power and wealth. So Frederick Norman knew precisely what he was facing when
                        Galloway&apos;s tall gaunt figure and face of the bird of prey appeared
                        before him. Galloway had triumphed and was triumphing not through obedience
                        to the Sunday sermons and the silly novels, poems, plays, and the nonsense
                        chattered by the obscure multitudes whom the <pb id="VAA2369-373" n="368"/>
                        mighty few exploit, but through obedience to the conditions imposed by our
                        social system. If he raised wages a little, it was in order that he might
                        have excuse for raising prices a great deal. If he gave away millions, it
                        was for his fame, and usually to quiet the scandal over some particularly
                        wicked wholesale robbery. No, Galloway was not a witness to the might of
                        altruistic virtue as a means to triumph. Charity and all the other forms of
                        chicanery by which the many are defrauded and fooled by the fewthose
                        &quot;virtues&quot; he understood and practiced. But
                        Justicehumanity&apos;s ages-long dream that at last seems to glitter as
                        a hope in the horizon of the futurejusticenot legal justice, nor moral
                        justice, but human justicethat idea would have seemed to him ridiculous,
                        Utopian, something for the women and the children and the socialists.</p>
                    <p>Norman understood Galloway, and Galloway understood Norman. Galloway, with an
                        old man&apos;s garrulity and a confirmed moral poseur&apos;s
                        eagerness about appearances, began to unfold his virtuous reasons for the
                        impending break with Burroughsthe industrial and financial war out of which
                        he expected to come doubly rich and all but supreme. Midway he stopped.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are not listening,&quot; said he sharply to the young man.</p>
                    <p>Their eyes met. Norman&apos;s eyes were twinkling.
                        &quot;No,&quot; said he, &quot;I am waiting.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was the suggestion of an answering gleam of <pb id="VAA2369-374"
                            n="369"/> sardonic humor in Galloway&apos;s cold gray eyes.
                        &quot;Waiting for what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;For you to finish with me as father confessor, to begin with me as
                        lawyer. Pray don&apos;t hurry. My time is yours.&quot; This with a
                        fine air of utmost suavity and respect.</p>
                    <p>In fact, while Galloway was doddering on and on with his fake moralities,
                        Norman was thinking of his own affairs, was wondering at his indifference
                        about Dorothy. The night beforethe few hours beforewhen he had dealt with
                        her so calmly, he, even as he talked and listened and acted, had assumed
                        that the enormous amount of liquor he had been consuming was in some way
                        responsible. He had said to himself, &quot;When I am over this, when I
                        have had sleep and return to the normal, I shall again be the foolish slave
                        of all these months.&quot; But here he was, sober, having taken only
                        enough whisky to prevent an abrupt let-downhere he was viewing her in the
                        same tranquil light. No longer all his life; no longer even dominant; only a
                        part of lifeand he was by no means certain that she was an important part.</p>
                    <p>How explain the mystery of the change? Because she had voluntarily come back,
                        did he feel that she was no longer baffling but was definitely his? Or had
                        passion running madly on and on droppedperhaps not dead, but almost deadfrom
                        sheer exhaustion?was it weary of racing and content to saunter and to
                        stroll? <pb id="VAA2369-375" n="370"/> ... He could not account for the
                        change. He only knew that he who had been quite mad was now quite sane...
                        Would he like to be rid of her? Did he regret that they were tied together?
                        No, curiously enough. It was high time he got married; she would do as well
                        as another. She had beauty, youth, amiability, physical charm for him. There
                        was advantage in the fact that her inferiority to him, her dependence on
                        him, would enable him to take as much or as little of her as he might feel
                        disposed, to treat her as the warrior must ever treat his entire domestic
                        establishment from wife down to pet dog or cat or baby... No, he did not
                        regret Josephine. He could see now disadvantages greater than her
                        advantages. All of value she would have brought him he could get for
                        himself, and she would have been troublesomeexacting, disputing his sway,
                        demanding full value or more in return for the love she was giving with such
                        exalted notions of its worth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are married?&quot; Galloway suddenly said, interrupting his
                        own speech and Norman&apos;s thought.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just married, I believe?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Young and old, high and low, successful and failed, we are a race of
                        advice-givers. As for Galloway, he was not one to neglect that showy form of
                        inexpensive benevolence. &quot;Have plenty of children,&quot; said
                        he. <pb id="VAA2369-376" n="371"/> &quot;And keep your family in the
                        country till they grow up. Town&apos;s no place for women. They go
                        crazy. Womenand most menhave no initiative. They think only about
                        whatever&apos;s thrust at them. In the country it&apos;ll be their
                        children and domestic things. In town it&apos;ll be getting and spending
                        money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman was struck by this. &quot;I think I&apos;ll take your
                        advice,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A man&apos;s home ought to be a retreat, not an inn. We are
                        humoring the women too much. They are forgetting who earns what they spend
                        in exhibiting themselves. If a woman wants that sort of thing, let her get
                        out and earn it. Why should she expect it from the man who has undertaken
                        her support because he wanted a wife to take care of his house and a mother
                        for his children? If a woman doesn&apos;t like the job, all right. But
                        if she takes it and accepts its pay, why, she should do its work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Flawless logic,&quot; said Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When I hire a man to work, he doesn&apos;t expect to idle about
                        showing other people how handsome he is in the clothes my money pays for.
                        Not that marriage is altogether a businessnot at all. But, my dear
                        sir&quot; And Galloway brought his cane down with the emphasis of one
                        speaking from a heart full of bitter experience&quot;unless it is a
                        business at bottom, organized and conducted on sound business principles,
                        there&apos;s no sentiment either. We are human beingsand that means <pb
                            id="VAA2369-377" n="372"/> we are first of all <hi rend="i"
                        >business</hi> beings, engaged in getting food, clothing, shelter. No
                            sentiment<hi rend="i">no</hi> sentiment, sir, is worth while that
                        isn&apos;t firmly grounded. It&apos;s a house without a foundation.
                        It&apos;s a steeple without a church under it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman looked at the old man with calm penetrating eyes. &quot;I shall
                        conduct my married life on a sound, business basis, or not at all,&quot;
                        said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll see,&quot; said Galloway.
                        &quot;That&apos;s what <hi rend="i">I</hi> said forty years ago No,
                        I didn&apos;t. I had no sense about such matters then. In my youth the
                        men knew nothing about the woman question.&quot; He smiled grimly.
                        &quot;I see signs that they are learning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then as abruptly as he had left the affairs he was there to discuss he
                        returned to them. His mind seemed to have freed itself of all irrelevancy
                        and superfluity, as a stream often runs from a faucet with much spluttering
                        and rather muddy at first, then steadies and clears. Norman gave him the
                        attention one can get only from a good mind that is interested in the
                        subject and understands it thoroughly. Such attention not merely receives
                        the words and ideas as they fall from the mouth of him who utters them, but
                        also seems to draw them by a sort of suction faster and in greater
                        abundance. It was this peculiar ability of giving attention, as much as any
                        other one quality, that gave Norman&apos;s clients their confidence in
                        him. Galloway, than whom no man was shrewder judge of men, showed in his
                        gratified eyes <pb id="VAA2369-378" n="373"/> and voice, long before he had
                        finished, how strongly his conviction of Norman&apos;s high ability was
                        confirmed.</p>
                    <p>When Galloway ended, Norman rapidly and in clear and simple sentences
                        summarized what Galloway had said. &quot;That is right?&quot; he
                        asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Precisely,&quot; said Galloway admiringly. &quot;What a
                        gift of clear statement you have, young man!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It has won me my place,&quot; said Norman. &quot;As to your
                        campaign, I can tell you now that the legal part of it can be arranged. That
                        is what the law is forto enable a man to do whatever he wants. The penalties
                        are for those who have the stupidity to try to do things in an unlawful
                        way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Galloway laughed. &quot;I had heard that they were for doing unlawful
                        things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing is unlawful,&quot; said Norman, &quot;except in
                        method.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s an interesting view of courts of justice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But we have no courts of justice. We have only courts of
                        law.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Galloway threw back his head and laughed till the tears rolled down his
                        cheeks. &quot;What a gift for clear statement!&quot; he cried.</p>
                    <p>Norman beamed appreciation of a compliment so flattering. But he went back to
                        business. &quot;As I was saying, you can do what you want to do. You
                        wish me to show you how. In our modern way of doing things, the relation of
                        lawyer and client has somewhat <pb id="VAA2369-379" n="374"/> changed. To
                        illustrate by this case, you are the bear with the taste for honey and the
                        strength to rob the bees. I am the honey birdthat is, the modern lawyerwho
                        can show you the way to the hive. Most of the honey birdsas yetare content
                        with a very small share of the honeywhatever the bear happens to be unable
                        to find room for. But I&quot;Norman&apos;s eyes danced and his
                        strong mouth curved in a charming smile&quot;I am a honey bird with a
                        bear appetite.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Galloway was sitting up stiffly. &quot;I don&apos;t quite follow you,
                        sir,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yet I am plain enough. My ability at clear statement has not
                        deserted me. If I show you the way through the tangled forest of the law to
                        this hive you scentI must be a partner in the honey.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Gralloway rose. &quot;Your conceptions of your professionand of me, I may
                        sayare not attractive. I have always been, and am willing and anxious to pay
                        liberallymore liberally than anyone elsefor legal advice. But my business,
                        sir, is my own.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman rose, his expression one of apology and polite disappointment.
                        &quot;I see I misunderstood your purpose in coming to me,&quot; said
                        he. &quot;Let us take no more of each other&apos;s time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what did you think my object was in coming?&quot; demanded
                        Galloway.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To get from me what you realized you could get nowhere elsewhich
                        meant, as an old experienced trader <pb id="VAA2369-380" n="375"/> like you
                        must have known, that you were ready to pay my price. Of course, if you can
                        get elsewhere the assistance you need, why, you would be most unwise to come
                        to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Galloway moved toward the door. &quot;And you might have charged
                        practically any fee you wished,&quot; said he, laughing satirically.
                        &quot;Young man, you are making the mistake that is ruining this
                        generation. You wish to get rich all at once. You are not willing to be
                        patient and to work and to build your fortune solidly and slowly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman smiled as at a good joke. &quot;What an asset to you strong men
                        has been the vague hope in the minds of the masses that each poor devil of
                        them will have his turn to loot and grow rich. I used to think ignorance
                        kept the present system going. But I have discovered that it is that sly,
                        silly, corrupt hope. But, sir, it does not catch me. I shall not work for
                        you and the other strong men, and patiently wait my turn that would never
                        come. My time is <hi rend="i">now</hi>.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You threaten me!&quot; cried Galloway furiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Threaten you?&quot; exclaimed Norman, amazed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think, because I have given you, my lawyer, my secrets, that
                        you can compel me&quot;</p>
                    <p>With an imperious gesture Norman stopped him. &quot;Good day,
                        sir,&quot; he said haughtily. &quot;Your secrets are safe with me. I
                        am a lawyer, not a financier.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Galloway was disconcerted. &quot;I beg your pardon, <pb id="VAA2369-381"
                            n="376"/> Mr. Norman,&quot; he said. &quot;I misunderstood you.
                        I thought I heard you say in effect that you purposed to be rich, and that
                        you purposed to compel me to make you so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So I did,&quot; replied Norman. &quot;But not by the
                        methods you financiers are so adept at using. Not by high-class blackmail
                        and blackjacking. I meant that my abilities were such that you and your
                        fellow masters of modern society would be compelled to employ me on my own
                        terms. A few moments ago you outlined to me a plan. It may be you can find
                        other lawyers competent to steer it through the channel of the law. I doubt
                        it. I may exaggerate my value. But&quot; He smiled pleasantly&quot;I
                        don&apos;t think so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In this modern world of ours there is no more delicate or more important
                        branch of the art of material success than learning to play one&apos;s
                        own tune on the trumpets of fame. To those who watch careers intelligently
                        and critically, and not merely with mouth agape and ears awag for whatever
                        sounds the winds of credulity bear, there is keen interest in noting how
                        differently this high art is practiced by the fame-seekershow well some
                        modest heroes disguise themselves before essaying the trumpet, how timidly
                        some play, how brazenly others. It is an art of infinite variety. How many
                        there are who can echo Shakespeare&apos;s sad lament, through
                        Hamlet&apos;s lips&quot;I lack advancement!&quot; Those are they
                        who have wholly neglected, as did Shakespeare, this <pb id="VAA2369-382"
                            n="377"/> essential part of the art of advancementShakespeare, who lived
                        almost obscure and was all but forgotten for two centuries after his death.</p>
                    <p>Norman, frankly seeking mere material success, and with the colossal egotism
                        that disdains egotism and shrugs at the danger of being accused of itNorman
                        did not hesitate to proclaim his own merits. He reasoned that he had the
                        wares, that crying them would attract attention to them, that he whose
                        attention was attracted, if he were a judge of wares and a seeker of the
                        best, would see that the Norman wares were indeed as Norman cried them. At
                        first blush Galloway was amused by Norman&apos;s candid self-esteem. But
                        he had often heard of Norman&apos;s conceitand in a long and busy life
                        he had not seen an able man who was unaware of his ability; any more than he
                        had seen a pretty woman unaware of her prettiness. So, at second blush,
                        Galloway was tempted by Norman&apos;s calm strong blast upon his own
                        trumpet to look again at the wares.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I always have had a high opinion of you, young man,&quot; said
                        he, with laughing eyes. &quot;Almost as high an opinion as you have of
                        yourself. Think over the legal side of my plan. When you get your thoughts
                        in order, let me knowand make me a proposition as to your own share. Does
                        that satisfy you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s all I ask,&quot; said Norman.</p>
                    <p>And they parted on the friendliest termsand Norman knew that his fortune was
                        assured, if Galloway <pb id="VAA2369-383" n="378"/> lived another nine
                        months. &quot;When he was alone, the sweat burst out upon him and,
                        trembling from head to foot, he locked his door and flung himself at full
                        length upon the rug. It was half an hour before the fit of silent hysterical
                        reaction passed sufficiently to let him gather strength to rise. He tottered
                        to his desk chair, and sat with his head buried in his arms upon the desk.
                        After a while the telephone at his side rang insistently. He took the
                        receiver in a hand he could not steady.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes?&quot; he called.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s Tetlow. How&apos;d you come out?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh&quot; He paused to stiffen his throat to attack the words
                        naturally&quot;all right. We go ahead.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;With G.?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly. But keep quiet. Don&apos;t let him know
                        you&apos;ve heard, if you see him or he sends for you. Remember,
                        it&apos;s in my hands entirely.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Trust me.&quot; Tetlow&apos;s voice, suppressed and
                        jubilant, suggested a fat, hoarse rooster trying to finish a crow before a
                        coming stone from a farm boy reaches him. &quot;It seems natural and
                        easy to you, old man. But I&apos;m about crazy with joy. I&apos;ll
                        come right over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. I&apos;m going home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t I see you there?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. I&apos;ve other matters to attend to. Come about lunch time
                        to-morrowto the office, here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Tetlow disappointedly, and Norman rang
                        off.</p>

                        over their fellow menbe it the brutal rule of the prize fighter over his
                        gang or the apparently gentle sway of the apparently meek bishop over his
                        loving flockin the faces of all men of power there is a dangerous look. They
                        may never lose their tempers. They may never lift their voices. They may be
                        ever suave and civil. The dangerous look is thereand the danger behind it.
                        And the sense of that look and of its cause has a certain restraining effect
                        upon all but the hopelessly impudent or solidly dense. Norman was one of the
                        men without fits of temper. In his moments of irritation, no one ever felt
                        that a storm of violent language might be impending. But the danger signal
                        flaunted from his face. Danger of what? No one could have said. Most people
                        would have laughed at the idea that so even tempered a man, pleased with
                        himself and with the world, could ever be dangerous. Yet everyone had
                        instinctively respected that danger flaguntil Dorothy.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps it had struck for herhad really not been there when she looked at
                        him. Perhaps she had been <pb id="VAA2369-385" n="380"/> too inexperienced,
                        perhaps too self-centered, to see it. Perhaps she had never before seen his
                        face in an hour of weariness and relaxationwhen the true character, the
                        dominating and essential trait or traits, shows nakedly upon the surface,
                        making the weak man or woman look pitiful, the strong man or woman
                        formidable.</p>
                    <p>However that may be, when he walked into the sitting room, greeted her
                        placidly and kissed her on the brow, she, glancing uncertainly up at him,
                        saw that danger signal for the first time. She studied his face, her own
                        face wearing her expression of the puzzled child. No, not quite that
                        expression as it always had been theretofore, but a modified form of it. To
                        any self-centered, self-absorbed womanthere comes in her married life,

                        or material, or both. In her egotism and vanity she has been regarding him
                        as her property. Suddenly, and usually disagreeably, it has been revealed to
                        her that she is his property. That hour had come for Dorothy Norman. And she
                        was looking at her husband, was wondering who and what he was.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve had your lunch?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have been out for the air?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-386" n="381"/>
                    <p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You didn&apos;t tell me what to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He smiled good humoredly. &quot;Oh, you had no money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesa little. But I&quot; She halted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You hadn&apos;t told me what to do,&quot; she repeated, as
                        if on mature thought that sentence expressed the whole matter.</p>
                    <p>He felt in his pockets, found a small roll of bills. He laid twenty-five
                        dollars on the table. &quot;I&apos;ll keep thirty,&quot; he
                        said, &quot;as I shan&apos;t have any more till I see Tetlow
                        to-morrow. Now, fly out and amuse yourself. I&apos;m going to sleep.
                        Don&apos;t wake me till you&apos;re ready for dinner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And he went into his bedroom and closed the door. When he awoke, he saw that
                        it was dark outside, and some note in the din of street noises from far
                        below made him feel that it was late. He wrapped a bathrobe round him,
                        opened the door into the sitting room. It was dark.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dorothy!&quot; he called.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; promptly responded the small quiet voice, so near
                        that he started back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; he exclaimed, and switched on the light.
                        &quot;There you areby the window. What were you doing, in the
                        dark?&quot;</p>

                            n="382"/> her. She was sitting with her hands listless in her lap and
                        her face a moving and beautiful expression of melancholy dreams. On the
                        table were the billswhere he had laid them. &quot;You&apos;ve been
                        out?&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; she replied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve beenwaiting,&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;For what?&quot; laughed he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;ForI don&apos;t know,&quot; she replied. &quot;Just
                        waiting.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But there&apos;s nothing to wait for.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him interrogatively. &quot;NoI suppose not,&quot; she
                        said.</p>
                    <p>He went back into his room and glanced at his watch. &quot;Eleven
                        o&apos;clock!&quot; he cried. &quot;Why didn&apos;t you wake
                        me? You must be nearly starved&quot;.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I <hi rend="i">am</hi> hungry,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>Her patient, passive resignation irritated him. &quot;I&apos;m
                        ravenous,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ll dressand you dress,
                        too. We&apos;ll go downstairs to supper.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When he reappeared in the sitting room, in a dinner jacket, she was again
                        seated near the window, hands listless in her lap and eyes gazing dreamily
                        into vacancy. But she was now dressed in the black chiffon and the big black
                        hat. He laughed. &quot;You are prompt and obedient,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;Nothing like hunger to subdue.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A faint flush tinged her lovely skin; the look of the child that has been
                        struck appeared in her eyes.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-388" n="383"/>
                    <p>He cast about in his mind for the explanation. Did she think he meant it was
                        need that had brought her meekly back to him? That was true enough, but he
                        had not intended to hint it. In high good humor because he was so
                        delightfully hungry and was about to get food, he cried: &quot;Do cheer
                        up! There&apos;s nothing to be sad aboutnothing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She lifted her large eyes and gazed at him timidly. &quot;What are you
                        going to do with me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take you downstairs and feed you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I meanafterward?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bringor sendyou up here to go to bed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you going away?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Away from me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her with amused eyes. She was exquisitely lovely; never had he
                        seen her lovelier. It delighted him to note her charmsthe charms that had
                        enslaved himnot a single charm missingand to feel that he was no longer
                        their slave, was his own master again.</p>
                    <p>A strange look swept across her uncannily mobile facea look of wonder, of
                        awe, of fear, of dread. &quot;You don&apos;t even like me any
                        more,&quot; she said in her colorless way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What have I done to make you think I dislike you?&quot; said he
                        pleasantly.</p>
                    <p>She gazed down in silence.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-389" n="384"/>
                    <p>&quot;You need have no fear,&quot; said he. &quot;You are my
                        wife. You will be well taken care of, and you will not be annoyed. What more
                        can I say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she murmured.</p>
                    <p>He winced. She had made him feel like an unpleasant cross between an
                        alms-giver and a bully. &quot;Now,&quot; said he, with forced but
                        resolute cheerfulness, &quot;we will eat, drink and be merry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>On the way down in the elevator he watched her out of the corner of his eye.
                        When they reached the hall leading to the supper room he touched her arm and
                        halted her. &quot;My dear,&quot; said he in the pleasant voice which
                        yet somehow never failed to secure attention and obedience,&quot; there
                        will be some of my acquaintances in there at supper. I don&apos;t want
                        them to see you with that whipped dog look. There&apos;s no occasion for
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her lip trembled. &quot;I&apos;ll do my best,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s see you smile,&quot; laughed he. &quot;You
                        have often shown me that you know the woman&apos;s trick of wearing what
                        feelings you choose on the outside. So don&apos;t pretend that
                        you&apos;ve got to look as if you were about to be hung for a crime you
                        didn&apos;t commit. There!that&apos;s better.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And indeed to a casual glance she looked the happy bride tryingnot very
                        successfullyto seem used to her husband and her new status.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hold it!&quot; he urged gayly. &quot;I&apos;ve no fancy
                        for leading round a lovely martyr in chains. Especially as <pb
                            id="VAA2369-390" n="385"/> you&apos;re about as healthy and well
                        placed a person as I know. And you&apos;ll feel as well as you look when
                        you&apos;ve had something to eat.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Whether it was obedience or the result of a decision to drop an unprofitable
                        pose he could not tell, but as soon as they were seated and she had a bill
                        of fare before her and was reading it, her expression of happiness lost its
                        last suggestion of being forced. &quot;Crab meat!&quot; she said.
                        &quot;I love it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Two portions of crab meat,&quot; he said to the waiter with pad
                        and pencil at attention.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t want that much,&quot; she protested.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You forget that <hi rend="i">I</hi> am hungry,&quot; rejoined
                        he. &quot;And when I am hungry, the price of food begins to go
                        up.&quot; He addressed himself to the waiter: &quot;After that a
                        broiled grousewith plenty of hominyand grilled sweet potatoesand a salad of
                        endive and hothouse tomatoesand I know the difference between hothouse
                        tomatoes and the other kinds. Nextsome cheeseCoullomiresyes, you have itI

                    <p>&quot;YesI think so,&quot; said Dorothy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You hear, waiter?and a bottle ofthere&apos;s the head waiterask
                        himhe knows the champagne I like.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-391" n="386"/>
                    <p>As Norman had talked, in the pleasant, insistent voice, the waiter had roused
                        from the air of mindless, mechanical sloth characteristic of the New York
                        waiterunless and until a fee below his high expectation is offered. When he
                        said the final &quot;very good, sir,&quot; it was with the accent of
                        real intelligence.</p>
                    <p>Dorothy was smiling, with the amusement of youth and inexperience.
                        &quot;What a lot of trouble you took about it,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>He shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Anything worth doing at all is worth
                        taking trouble about. You will see. We shall get results. The supper will be
                        the best this house can put together.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can have anything you want in this world, if you only can pay
                        for it,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s what most people think,&quot; replied he.
                        &quot;But the truth is, the paying is only a small part of the art of
                        getting what one wants.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She glanced nervously at him. &quot;I&apos;m beginning to realize
                        that I&apos;m dreadfully inexperienced,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s nothing discouraging in that,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;Lack of experience can be remedied. But not lack of judgment. It
                        takes the great gift of judgment to enable one to profit by mistakes, to
                        decide what is the real lesson of an experience.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m afraid I haven&apos;t any. judgment,
                        either,&quot; confessed she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That remains to be seen.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-392" n="387"/>
                    <p>She hesitatedventured: &quot;What do you think is my worst
                        fault?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shook his head laughingly. &quot;We are going to have a happy
                        supper.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think I am very vain?&quot; persisted she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who&apos;s been telling you so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Tetlow. He gave me an awful talking to, just before I&quot;
                        She paused at the edge of the forbidden ground. &quot;He didn&apos;t
                        spare me,&quot; she went on. &quot;He said I was a vain,
                        self-centered little fool.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what did you say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was very angry. I told him he had no right to accuse me of that.
                        I reminded him that he had never heard me say a word about myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And did he say that the vainest people were just that waynever
                        speaking of themselves, never thinking of anything else?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he told you what he said,&quot; cried she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; laughed he.</p>
                    <p>She reddened. &quot;<hi rend="i">You</hi> think I&apos;m
                        vain?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He made a good-humoredly satirical little bow. &quot;I think you are
                        charming,&quot; said he. &quot;It would be a waste of time to look
                        at or to think of anyone else when oneself is the most charming and
                        interesting person in the world. Still&quot; He put into his face and
                        voice a suggestion of gravity that caught her utmost attention&quot;if
                        one is to get anywhere, is to win consideration from othersand happiness for
                        oneselfone simply <pb id="VAA2369-393" n="388"/> must do a little thinking
                        about othersoccasionally.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her eyes lowered. A faint color tinged her cheeks.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The reason most of us are so uncomfortabledownright unhappy most of
                        the timeis that we never really take our thoughts off our precious
                        fascinating selves. The result is that some day we find that the likingand
                        friendshipand loveof those around us has limitsand we are left severely
                        alone. Of course, if one has a great deal of money, one can buy excellent
                        imitations of liking and friendship and even loveI ought to say, especially
                        love&quot;</p>
                    <p>The color flamed in her face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But,&quot; he went on, &quot;if one is in modest
                        circumstances or poor, one has to take care.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Or dependent,&quot; she said, with one of those unexpected
                        flashes of subtle intelligence that so complicated the study of her
                        character. He had been talking to amuse himself rather than with any idea of
                        her understanding. Her sudden bright color and her two words&quot;or
                        dependent&quot;roused him to see that she thought he was deliberately
                        giving her a savage lecture from the cover of general remarks.
                        &quot;With the vanity of the typical woman,&quot; he said to
                        himself, &quot;she always imagines <hi rend="i">she</hi> is the subject
                        of everyone&apos;s thought and talk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Or dependent,&quot; said he to her, easily. &quot;I
                        wasn&apos;t thinking of you, but yours <hi rend="i">is</hi> a case in
                        point. Come, <pb id="VAA2369-394" n="389"/> nownothing to look blue about!
                        Here&apos;s something to eat. No, it&apos;s for the next
                        table.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You won&apos;t let me explain,&quot; she protested, between
                        the prudence of reproach and the candor of anger.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s nothing to explain,&quot; replied he.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t bother about the mistakes of yesterday. Remember
                        themyes. If one has a good memory, to forget is impossiblenot to say unwise.
                        But there ought to be no more heat or sting in the memory of past mistakes
                        than in the memory of last year&apos;s mosquito bites.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The first course of the supper arrived. Her nervousness vanished, and he got
                        far away from the neighborhood of the subjects that, even in remotest hint,
                        could not but agitate her. And as the food and the wine asserted their
                        pacific and beatific sway, she and he steadily moved into better and better
                        humor with each other. Her beauty grew until it had him thinking that never,
                        not in the most spiritual feminine conceptions of the classic painters, had
                        he seen a loveliness more ethereal. Her skin was so exquisite, the coloring
                        of her hair and eyes and of her lips was so delicately fine that it gave her
                        the fragility of things bordering upon the supernalof rare exotics, of
                        sunset and moonbeam effects. No, he had been under no spell of illusion as
                        to her beauty. It was a realitythe more fascinating because it waxed and
                        waned not with regularity of period but capriciously.</p>
                    <p>He began to look round furtively, to see what effect <pb id="VAA2369-395"
                            n="390"/> this wife of his was producing on others. These last few
                        months, through prudence as much as through pride, he had been cultivating
                        the habit of ignoring his surroundings; he would not invite cold salutations
                        or obvious avoidance of speaking. He now discovered many of his former
                        associatesand his vanity dilated as he noted how intensely they were
                        interested in his wife.</p>
                    <p>Some men of ability have that purest form of egotism which makes one
                        profoundly content with himself, genuinely indifferent to the approval or
                        the disapproval of others. Norman&apos;s vanity had a certain amount of
                        alloy. He genuinely disdained his fellow-mentheir timidity, their hypocrisy,
                        their servility, their limited range of ideas. He was indifferent to the
                        verge of insensibility as to their adverse criticism. But at the same time
                        it was necessary to his happiness that he get from them evidences of their
                        admiration and envy. With that amusing hypocrisy which tinges all human
                        nature, he concealed from himself the satisfaction, the joy even, he got out
                        of the showy side of his position. And no feature of his infatuation for
                        Dorothy surprised him so much as the way it rode rough shod and reckless
                        over his snobbishness.</p>
                    <p>With the fading of infatuation had come many reflections upon the practical
                        aspects of what he had done. It pleased him with himself to find that, in
                        this first test, he had not the least regret, but on the contrary <pb
                            id="VAA2369-396" n="391"/> a genuine pride in the courageous
                        independence he had shownanother and strong support to his conviction of his
                        superiority to his fellow-men. He might be somewhat snobbishwho was not?who
                        else in his New York was less than supersaturated with snobbishness? But
                        snobbishness, the determining quality in the natures of all the women and
                        most of the men he knew, had shown itself one of the incidental qualities in
                        his own nature. After all, reflected he, it took a man, a good deal of a
                        man, to do what he had done, and not to regret it, even in the hour of
                        disillusionment. And it must be said for this egotistic self-approval of his
                        that like all his judgments there was sound merit of truth in it. The vanity
                        of the nincompoop is ridiculous. The vanity of the man of ability is amusing
                        and no doubt due to a defective point of view upon the proportions of the
                        universe; but it is not without excuse, and those who laugh might do well to
                        discriminate even as they guffaw.</p>
                    <p>Looking discreetly about, Norman was suddenly confronted by the face of
                        Josephine Burroughs, only two tables away.</p>
                    <p>Until their eyes squarely met he did not know she was there, or even in
                        America. Before he could make a beginning of glancing away, she gave him her
                        sweetest smile and her friendliest bow. And Dorothy, looking to see to whom
                        he was speaking, was astonished to receive the same radiance of cordiality.
                        Norman was <pb id="VAA2369-397" n="392"/> pleased at the way his wife dealt
                        with the situation. She returned both bow and smile in her own quiet,
                        slightly reserved way of gentle dignity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who was that, speaking?&quot; asked she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Burroughs. You must remember her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He noted it as characteristic that she said, quite sincerely: &quot;Oh,
                        so it is. I didn&apos;t remember her. That is the girl you were engaged
                        to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes&apos;the nice girl uptown,&apos;&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t like her,&quot; said Dorothy, with evident
                        small interest in the subject. &quot;She was vain.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean you didn&apos;t like her way of being vain,&quot;
                        suggested Norman. &quot;Everyone is vain; so, if we disliked for vanity
                        we should dislike everyone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, it was her way. And just now she spoke to us both, as if she
                        were doing us a favor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gracious, it&apos;s called,&quot; said he. &quot;What
                        of it? It does us no harm and gives her about the only happiness
                        she&apos;s got.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman, without seeming to do so, noted the rest of the Burroughs party. At
                        Josephine&apos;s right sat a handsome young foreigner, and it took small
                        experience of the world to discover that he was paying court to her, and
                        that she was pleased and flattered. Norman asked the waiter who he was, and
                        learned that he came from the waiter&apos;s own province of France, was
                        the Due de Valdme. At first glance Norman had thought him distinguished.
                        Afterward he discriminated. There are <pb id="VAA2369-398" n="393"/> several
                        kinds or degrees of distinction. There is distinction of race, of class, of
                        family, of dress, of person. As Frenchman, as aristocrat, as a scion of the
                        ancient family of Valdme, as a specimen of tailoring and valeting, Miss
                        Burroughs&apos;s young man was distinguished. But in his own proper
                        person he was rather insignificant. The others at the table were Americans.
                        Following Miss Burroughs&apos;s cue, they sought an opportunity to speak
                        friendlily to Normanand he gave it them. His acknowledgment of those
                        effusive salutations was polite but restrained.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They are friends of yours?&quot; said Dorothy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They were,&quot; said he. &quot;And they may be again when
                        they are friends of <hi rend="i">ours.</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not very good at making friends,&quot; she warned
                        him. &quot;I don&apos;t like many people.&quot; This time her
                        unconscious and profound egotism pleased him. Evidently it did not occur to
                        her that she should be eager to be friends with those people on any terms,
                        that the only question was whether they would receive her.</p>
                    <p>She asked: &quot;Why was MissMiss Burroughs so friendly?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why shouldn&apos;t she be?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I thought you threw her over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He winced at this crude way of putting it. &quot;On the contrary, she
                        threw me over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dorothy laughed incredulously. &quot;I know better. Mr. Tetlow told
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-399" n="394"/>
                    <p>&quot;She threw me over,&quot; repeated he coldly. &quot;Tetlow
                        was repeating malicious and ignorant gossip.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dorothy laughed againit was her second glass of champagne. &quot;You say
                        that because it&apos;s the honorable thing to say. But I know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I say it because it&apos;s true,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>He spoke quietly, but if she had drunk many more than two glasses of an
                        unaccustomed and heady liquor she would have felt his intonation. She paled
                        and shrank and her slim white fingers fluttered nervously at the collar of
                        her dress. &quot;I was only joking,&quot; she murmured.</p>
                    <p>He laughed good-naturedly. &quot;Don&apos;t look as if I had given
                        you a whipping,&quot; said he. &quot;Surely you&apos;re not
                        afraid of me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She glanced shyly at him, a smile dancing in her eyes and upon her lips.
                        &quot;Yes,&quot; she said. And after a pause she added: &quot;I
                        didn&apos;t used to be. But that was because I didn&apos;t know
                        youor much of anything.&quot; The smile irradiated her whole face.
                        &quot;You used to be afraid of me. But you aren&apos;t, any
                        more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said he, looking straight at her. &quot;No,
                        I&apos;m not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I always told you you were mistaken in what you thought of me. I
                        really don&apos;t amount to much. A man as serious and as important as
                        you are couldn&apos;tcouldn&apos;t care about me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s true you don&apos;t amount to much, as
                        yet,&quot; said <pb id="VAA2369-400" n="395"/> he. &quot;And if you
                        never do amount to much, you&apos;d be no less than most women and most
                        men. But I&apos;ve an ideaat timesthat you <hi rend="i">could</hi>
                        amount to something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He saw that he had wounded her vanity, that her protestations of humility
                        were precisely what he had suspected. He laughed at her: &quot;I see you
                        thought I&apos;d contradict you. But I can&apos;t afford to be so
                        amiable now. And the first thing you&apos;ve got to get rid of is the
                        part of your vanity that prevents you from growing. Vanity of belief in
                        one&apos;s possibilities is fine. No one gets anywhere without it. But
                        vanity of belief in one&apos;s present perfectionno one but a god could
                        afford that luxury.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Observing her closely he was amusedand pleasedto note that she was struggling
                        to compose herself to endure his candors as a necessary part of the duties
                        and obligations she had taken on herself when she gave up and returned to
                        him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What <hi rend="i">you</hi> thought of <hi rend="i">me</hi> used to
                        be the important thing in our relations,&quot; he went on, in his way of
                        raillery that took all or nearly all the sting out of what he said, but none
                        of its strength. &quot;Now, the important thing is what I think of you.
                        You are much younger than I, especially in experience. You are going to
                        school to life with me as teacher. You&apos;ll dislike the teacher for
                        the severity of the school. That isn&apos;t just, but it&apos;s
                        naturalperhaps inevitable. And pleasemy dearwhen you are bitterest over what
                            <hi rend="i">you</hi> have to put up <pb id="VAA2369-401" n="396"/> with
                        from <hi rend="i">me</hi>don&apos;t forget what <hi rend="i">I</hi> have
                        to put up with from <hi rend="i">you.</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was fighting bravely against angry tears. As for him, he had suddenly
                        become indifferent to what the people around them might be thinking. With
                        all his old arrogance come back in full flood, he was feeling that he would
                        live his own life in his own way and that those who didn&apos;t
                        approveyes, including Dorothymight do as they saw fit. She said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t blame you for regretting that you didn&apos;t
                        marry Miss Burroughs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I don&apos;t regret it,&quot; replied he. &quot;On
                        the contrary, I&apos;m glad.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She glanced hopefully at him. But the hopeful expression faded as he went on:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whether or not I made a mistake in marrying you, I certainly had an
                        escape from disaster when she decided she preferred a foreigner and a title.
                        There&apos;s a good sensible reason why so many girls of her classmore
                        and more all the timemarry abroad. They are not fit to be the wives of
                        hard-working American husbands. In fact I&apos;ve about reached the
                        conclusion that of the girls growing up nowdays very few in any class are
                        fit to be American wives. They&apos;re not big enough. They&apos;re
                        too coarse and crude in their tastes. They&apos;re only fit for the
                        shallow, showy sort of thingand the European aristocracy is their hopeand
                        their place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her small face had a fascinating expression of a <pb id="VAA2369-402" n="[]"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2369-4">
                            <p>&quot;At Josephine&apos;s right sat a handsome young
                                foreigner.&quot;</p>
                        </figure>

                        its depth. He was interested in his own thoughts, however, and went onfor,
                        if he had been in the habit of stopping when his hearers failed to
                        understand, or when they misunderstood, either he would have been silent
                        most of the time in company or his conversation would have been as petty and
                        narrow and devoid of originality or imagination as is the mentality of most
                        human beingas is the talk and reading that impress them as interestingand
                        profound!</p>
                    <p>&quot;The American man of the more ambitious sort,&quot; he went on,
                        &quot;either has to live practically if not physically apart from his
                        wife or else has to educate some not too difficult woman to be his
                        wife.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She understood that. &quot;You are really going to educate me?&quot;
                        she said, with an arch smile. Now that Norman had her attention, now that
                        she was centering upon him instead of upon herself, she was interested in
                        him, and in what he said, whether she understood it or not, whether it
                        pleased her vanity or wounded it. The intellects of women work to an
                        unsuspected extent only through the sex charm. Their appreciations of books,
                        of art, of men are dependant, often in the most curious indirect ways, upon
                        the fact that the author, the artist, the politician or what not is
                        betrousered. Thus, Dorothy was patient, respectful, attentive, was not
                        offended by Norman&apos;s didactic way of giving her the lessons in
                        life. Her smile was <pb id="VAA2369-404" n="398"/> happy as well as
                        coquettish, as she asked him to educate her.</p>
                    <p>He returned her smile. &quot;That depends,&quot; answered he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re not sure I&apos;m worth the trouble?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You may put it that way, if you like. But I&apos;d say, rather,
                        I&apos;m not sure I can spare the timeand you&apos;re not sure you
                        care to fit yourself for the place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, but I do!&quot; cried she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll seein a few weeks or months,&quot; replied he.</p>
                    <p>The Burroughs party were rising. Josephine had choice of two ways to the
                        door. She chose the one that took her past Norman and his bride. She
                        advanced, beaming. Norman rose, took her extended hand. Said she:</p>
                    <p>&quot;So glad to see you.&quot; Then, turning the radiant smile upon
                        Dorothy, &quot;And is this your wife? Is this the pretty little
                        typewriter girl?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dorothy noddeda charming, ingenuous bend of the head. Norman felt a thrill of
                        pride in her, so beautifully unconscious of the treacherous attempt at
                        insult. It particularly delighted him that she had not made the mistake of
                        rising to return Josephine&apos;s greeting but had remained seated.
                        Surely this wife of his had the right instincts that never fail to cause
                        right manners. For Josephine&apos;s benefit, he gazed down at Dorothy
                        with the proudest, fondest eyes. &quot;Yesthis is she,&quot; said
                        he. &quot;Can you blame me?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-405" n="[399]"/>
                    <p>Josephine paled and winced visibly, as if the blow she had aimed at him had,
                        after glancing off harmlessly, returned to crush her. She touched
                        Dorothy&apos;s proffered hand, murmured a few stammering phrases of
                        vague compliment, rejoined her friends. Said Dorothy, when she and Norman
                        were settled again:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall never like her. Nor she me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you do like this cheese? Waiter, another bottle of that
                        same.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why did she put you in such a good humor?&quot; inquired his
                        wife.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It wasn&apos;t she. It was you!&quot; replied he. But he
                        refused to explain.</p>

                    <p>G<hi rend="sc">ALLOWAY</hi> accepted Norman&apos;s terms. He would
                        probably have accepted terms far less easy. But Norman as yet knew with the
                        thoroughness which must precede intelligent plan and action only the legal
                        side of financial operations; he had been as indifferent to the commercial
                        side as a pilot to the value of the cargo in the ship he engages to steer
                        clear of shoals and rocks. So with the prudence of the sagacious
                        man&apos;s audacities he contented himself with a share of this first
                        venture that would simply make a comfortable foundation for the fortune he
                        purposed to build. As the venture could not fail outright, even should
                        Galloway die, he rented a largish place at Hempstead, with the privilege of
                        purchase, and installed his wife and himself with a dozen servants and a
                        housekeeper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This housekeeper, this Mrs. Lowell,&quot; said he to Dorothy,
                        &quot;is a good enough person as housekeepers go. But you will have to
                        look sharply after her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dorothy seemed to fade and shrink within herself, which was her way of
                        confessing lack of courage and fitness to face a situation: &quot;I
                        don&apos;t know anything about those things,&quot; she confessed.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-407" n="401"/>
                    <p>&quot;I understand perfectly,&quot; said he. &quot;But you
                        learned something at the place in Jersey Cityquite enough for the start.
                        Really, all you need to know just now is whether the place is clean or not,
                        and whether the food comes on the table in proper condition. The rest
                        you&apos;ll pick up gradually.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope so,&quot; said she, looking doubtful and helpless; these
                        new magnitudes were appalling, especially now that she was beginning to get
                        a point of view upon life.</p>
                    <p>&quot;At any rate, don&apos;t bother me for these few next
                        months,&quot; said he. &quot;I&apos;m going to be very busyshall
                        leave early in the morning and not be back until near dinner timeif I come
                        at all. No, you&apos;ll not be annoyed by me. You&apos;ll be
                        absolute mistress of your time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She tried to look as if this contented her. But he could not have failed to
                        see how dissatisfied and disquieted she really was. He had the best of
                        reasons for thinking that she was living under the same roof with him only
                        because she preferred the roof he could provide to such a one as she could
                        provide for herself whether by her own earnings or by marrying a man more to
                        her liking personally. Yet here she was, piqued and depressed because of his
                        indifferencebecause he was not thrusting upon her gallantries she would
                        tolerate only through prudence!</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will be lonely at times, I&apos;m afraid,&quot; said
                        he. &quot;But I can&apos;t provide friends or even acquaintances for
                            <pb id="VAA2369-408" n="402"/> you for several monthsuntil my affairs
                        are in better order and my sister and her husband come back from
                        Europe.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I shan&apos;t be lonely,&quot; cried she.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve never cared for people.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve your books, and your musicand ridingand shopping
                        trips to townand the house and grounds to look after.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesand my dreams,&quot; said she hopefully, her eyes suggesting
                        the dusky star depths.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ohthe dreams. You&apos;ll have little time for them,&quot;
                        said he drily. &quot;And little inclination, I imagine, as you wake up
                        to the sense of how much there is to be learned. Dreaming is the pastime of
                        people who haven&apos;t the intelligence or the energy to accomplish
                        anything. If you wish to please meand you dodon&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she murmured. She forced her rebellious lips to the
                        laconic assent. She drooped the lids over her rebellious eyes, lest he
                        should detect her wounded feelings and her resentment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I assumed so,&quot; said he, with a secret smile.
                        &quot;Well, if you wish to please me, you&apos;ll give your time to
                        practical thingsthings that&apos;ll make you more interesting and make
                        us both more comfortable. It was all very well to dream, while you had
                        little to do and small opportunity. But now Try to cut it out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It is painful to an American girl of any class to find that she has to earn
                        her position as wife. The <pb id="VAA2369-409" n="403"/> current theory, a
                        tradition from an early and woman-revering day, is that the girl has done
                        her share and more when she has consented to the suit of the ardent male and
                        has intrusted her priceless charms to his exclusive keeping. According to
                        that same theory, it is the husband who must earn his positionmust continue
                        to earn it. He is a humble creature, honored by the presence of a wonderful
                        being, a cross between a queen and a goddess. He cannot do enough to show
                        his gratitude. Perhapsbut only perhapshad Norman married Josephine
                        Burroughs, he might have assented, after a fashion, to this idea of the
                        relations of the man and the woman. No doubt, had he remained under the
                        spell of Dorothy&apos;s mystery and beauty, he would have felt and acted
                        the slave he had made of himself at the outset. But in the circumstances he
                        was looking at their prospective life together with sane eyes. And so she
                        had, in addition to all her other reasons for heartache, a sense that she,
                        the goddess-queen, the American woman, with the birthright of dominion over
                        the male, was being cheated, humbled, degraded.</p>
                    <p>At first he saw that this sense of being wronged made it impossible for her
                        to do anything at all toward educating herself for her position. But time
                        brought about the change he had hoped for. A few weeks, and she began to
                        cheer up, almost in spite of herself. What was the use in sulking or sighing
                        or in self-pitying, when it brought only unhappiness to oneself? The <pb
                            id="VAA2369-410" n="404"/> coarse and brutal male in the case was either
                        unaware or indifferent. There was no one and no place to fly tounless she
                        wished to be much worse off than her darkest mood of self-pity represented
                        her to her sorrowing self. The housekeeper, Mrs. Lowell, was a
                        &quot;broken down gentlewoman&quot; who had been chastened by
                        misfortune into a wholesome state of practical good sense about the relative
                        values of the real and the romantic. Mrs. Lowell diagnosed the case of the
                        young wifeas Norman had shrewdly guessed she wouldand was soon adroitly
                        showing her the many advantages of her lot. Before they had been three
                        months at Hempstead, Dorothy had discovered that she, in fact, was without a
                        single ground for serious complaint. She had a husband who was generous
                        about money, and left her as absolutely alone as if he were mere occasional
                        visitor at the house. She had her livingand such a living!she had plenty of
                        interesting occupationshe had not a single sordid careand perfect health.</p>
                    <p>The dreams, too It was curious about those dreams. She would now have found
                        it an intolerable bore to sit with hands idle in her lap and eyes upon
                        vacancy, watching the dim, luminous shadows flit aimlessly by. Yet that was
                        the way she used to pass hoursentire days. She used to fight off sleep at
                        night the longer to enjoy her one source of pure happiness. There was no
                        doubt about it, the fire of romance was burning low, and she was becoming
                        commonplace, practical, resigned. <pb id="VAA2369-411" n="405"/> Well, why
                        not? Was not life over for her?that is, the life a girl&apos;s fancy
                        longs for. In place of hope of romance, there was an uneasy feeling of a
                        necessity of pleasing this husband of hersof making him comfortable. What
                        would befall her if she neglected trying to please him or if she, for all
                        her trying, failed? She did not look far in that direction. Her uneasiness
                        remained indefiniteyet definite enough to keep her working from waking until
                        bedtime. And she dropped into the habit of watching his face with the same
                        anxiety with which a farmer watches the weather. When he happened one day to
                        make a careless, absent-minded remark in disapproval of something in the
                        domestic arrangements, she was thrown into such a nervous flutter that he
                        observed it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothingnothing,&quot; replied she in the hurried tone of one
                        who is trying hastily to cover his thoughts.</p>
                    <p>He reflected, understood, burst into a fit of hearty laughter. &quot;So,
                        you are trying to make a bogey of me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She colored, protested faintly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you know I&apos;m about the least tyrannical,
                        least exacting person in the world?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve been very patient with me,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nownow,&quot; cried he in a tone of raillery, &quot;you
                        might as well drop that. Don&apos;t you know there&apos;s no reason
                        for being afraid of me?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-412" n="406"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I <hi rend="i">know</hi> it,&quot; replied she.
                        &quot;But I <hi rend="i">feel</hi> afraid, just the same. I
                        can&apos;t help it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was impossible for him to appreciate the effect of his personality upon
                        othershow, without his trying or even wishing, it made them dread a purely
                        imaginary displeasure and its absurdly imaginary consequences. But this
                        confession of hers was not the first time he had heard of the effect of
                        potential and latent danger he had upon those associated with him. And, as
                        it was most useful, he was not sorry that he had it. He made no further
                        attempt to convince her that he was harmless. He knew that he was harmless
                        where she was concerned. Was it not just as well that she should not know
                        it, when vaguely dreading him was producing excellent results? As with a
                        Christian the fear of the Lord was the beginning of wisdom, so with a wife
                        the fear of her husband was the beginning of wisdom. In striving to please
                        him, to fit herself for the position of wife, she was using up the time she
                        would otherwise have spent in making herself miserable with self-pitythat
                        supreme curse of the idle both male and female, that most prolific of the
                        breeders of unhappy wives. Yes, wives were unhappy not because their
                        husbands neglected them, for busy people have no time to note whether they
                        are neglected or not, but because they gave their own worthless, negligent,
                        incapable selves too much attention.</p>
                    <p>One evening, she, wearing the look of the timid but <pb id="VAA2369-413"
                            n="407"/> resolute intruder, came into his room while he was dressing
                        for dinner and hung about with an air no map of his experience could fail to
                        understand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Something wrong about the house?&quot; said he finally.
                        &quot;Need more money?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nonothing,&quot; she replied, with a slight flush. He saw that
                        she was mustering all her courage for some grand effort. He waited, only
                        mildly curious, as his mind was busy with some new business he and Tetlow
                        had undertaken. Presently she stood squarely before him, her hands behind
                        her back and her face up-turned. &quot;Won&apos;t you kiss
                        me?&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure!&quot; said he. And he kissed her on the cheek and resumed
                        operations with his military brushes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t mean thatthat kind of a kiss,&quot; said she
                        dejectedly.</p>
                    <p>He paused with a quick characteristic turn of the head, looked keenly at her,
                        resumed his brushing. A quizzical smile played over his face. &quot;Oh,
                        I see,&quot; said he. &quot;You&apos;ve been thinking about
                        duty. And you&apos;ve decided to do yours.... Eh?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think It seems to me I don&apos;t think&quot; she
                        stammered, then said desperately, &quot;I&apos;ve not been acting
                        right by you. I want toto do better.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s good,&quot; said he briskly, with a nod of
                        approvaland never a glance in her direction. &quot;You think
                        you&apos;ll let me have a kiss now and theneh? All right, my
                        dear.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-414" n="408"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you <hi rend="i">won&apos;t</hi> understand me!&quot;
                        she cried, ready to weep with vexation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean I won&apos;t misunderstand you,&quot; replied he
                        amiably, as he set about fixing his tie. &quot;You&apos;ve been
                        mulling things over in your mind. You&apos;ve decided I&apos;m
                        secretly pining for you. You&apos;ve resolved to be good and kind and
                        dutifulgenerousto feed old dog Tray a few crumbs now and then....
                        That&apos;s nice and sweet of you&quot; He paused until the crisis
                        in tying was passed&quot;very nice and sweet of youbutThere&apos;s
                        nothing in it. All I ask of you for myself is to see that I&apos;m
                        comfortablethat Mrs. Lowell and the servants treat me right. If I
                        don&apos;t like anything, I&apos;ll speak outnever fear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;ButFredI want to be your wifeI&apos; really do,&quot; she
                        pleaded.</p>
                    <p>He turned on her, and his eyes seemed to pierce into the chamber of her
                        thoughts. &quot;Drop it, my dear,&quot; he said quietly.
                        &quot;Neither of us is in love with the other. So there&apos;s not
                        the slightest reason for pretending. If I ever want to be free of you,
                        I&apos;ll tell you so. If you ever want to get rid of me, all you have
                        to do is to askand it&apos;ll be arranged. Meanwhile, let&apos;s
                        enjoy ourselves.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His good humor, obviously unfeigned, would have completely discouraged a more
                        experienced woman, though as vain as Dorothy and with as much ground as he
                        had given her for self-confidence where he was <pb id="VAA2369-415" n="409"
                        /> concerned. But Dorothy was depressed rather than profoundly discouraged.
                        A few moments and she found courage to plead: &quot;But you used to care
                        for me. Don&apos;t I attract you any more?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You say that quite pathetically,&quot; said he, in good-humored
                        amusement. &quot;I&apos;m willing to do anything within reason for
                        your happiness. But reallyjust to please your vanity I can&apos;t make
                        myself over again into the fool I used to be about you. You&apos;d hate
                        it yourself. Why, then, this pathetic air?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I feel so uselessand as if I were shirking,&quot; she
                        persisted. &quot;And if you did care for me, it wouldn&apos;t offend
                        me now as it used to. I&apos;ve grown much wisermore sensible. I
                        understand thingsand I look at them differently. AndI always did <hi
                            rend="i">like</hi> you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even when you despised me?&quot; mocked he. It irritated him a
                        little vividly to recall what a consummate fool he had made of himself for
                        her, even though he had every reason to be content with the event of his
                        folly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A girl always thinks she despises a man when she can do as she
                        pleases with him,&quot; replied she. &quot;As Mr. Tetlow said, I was
                        a fool.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">I</hi> was the fool,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;Where did that man of mine lay the handkerchief?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I, too,&quot; cried she, eagerly. &quot;You were foolish to
                        bother about a little silly like me. But, oh, what a <hi rend="i">fool</hi>
                        I was not to realize&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-416" n="410"/>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re not trying to tell me you&apos;re in love with
                        me?&quot; said he sharply.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, nono, indeed,&quot; she protested in haste, alarmed by his
                        overwhelming manner. &quot;I&apos;m not trying to deceive you in any
                        way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never do,&quot; said he. &quot;It&apos;s the one thing
                        I can&apos;t stand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I thoughtit seemed to me&quot; she persisted,
                        &quot;that perhaps if we tried toto care for each other, we&apos;d
                        maybe get toto caringmore or less. Don&apos;t you think so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; was his careless reply. He added, &quot;But
                        I, for one, am well content with things as they are. I confess I
                        don&apos;t look back with any satisfaction on those months when I was
                        making an ass of myself about you. I was ruining my career. Now I&apos;m
                        happy, and everything is going fine in my business. No experiments, if you
                        please.&quot; He shook his head, looking at her with smiling raillery.
                        &quot;It might turn out that I&apos;d care for you in the same crazy
                        way again, and that you didn&apos;t like it. Again you might get excited
                        about me and I&apos;d remain calm about you. That would give me a
                        handsome revenge, but I&apos;m not looking for revenge.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He finished his toilet, she standing quiet and thoughtful in an attitude of
                        unconscious grace.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, my dear,&quot; resumed he, as he prepared to descend for
                        dinner, &quot;let&apos;s have a peaceful, cheerful married <pb
                            id="VAA2369-417" n="411"/> life, with no crazy excitements.
                        Let&apos;s hang on to what we&apos;ve got, and take no unnecessary
                        risks.&quot; He patted her on the shoulder. &quot;Isn&apos;t
                        that sensible?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him with serious, appealing eyes. &quot;You are <hi
                            rend="i">sure</hi> you aren&apos;t unhappy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was amusing to himthough he concealed itto see how tenaciously her
                        feminine egotism held to the idea that she was the important person. And,
                        when women of experience thus deluded themselves, it was not at all strange
                        that this girl should be unable to grasp the essential truth as to the
                        relations of men and womenthat, while a woman who makes her sex her
                        profession must give to a man, to some man, a dominant place in her life, a
                        man need give a womanat least, any one womanlittle or no place. But he would
                        not wantonly wound her harmless vanity. &quot;Don&apos;t worry about
                        me, please,&quot; said he in the kindest, friendliest way. &quot;I
                        am telling you the truth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And they descended to the dining room. Usually he was preoccupied and she did
                        most of the talkingnot a difficult matter for her, as she was one of those
                        who by nature have much to say, who talk on and on, giving lively, pleasant
                        recitals of commonplace daily happenings. That evening it was her turn to be
                        abstracted, or, at least, silent. He talked volubly, torrentially, like a
                        man of teeming mind in the highest spirits. And he was in high spirits. The
                        Galloway enterprise had developed into a huge success; also, it <pb
                            id="VAA2369-418" n="412"/> did not lessen his sense of the pleasantness
                        of life to have learned that his wife was feeling about as well disposed
                        toward him as he cared to have her feel, had come round to that state of
                        mind which he, as a practical man, wise in the art of life, regarded as
                        ideal for a wife.</p>
                    <p>A successful man, with a quiet and comfortable home, well enough looked after
                        by an agreeable wife, exceeding good to look at and interested only in her
                        home and her husbandwhat more could a man ask?</p>
                    <p>What more could a man ask? Only one thing more a baby. The months soon passed
                        and that rounding out of the home side of his life was consummated with no
                        mishap. The baby was a girl, which contented him and delighted Dorothy. He
                        wished it to be named after her, she preferred his sister&apos;s
                        nameUrsula. It was Ursula who decided the question. &quot;She looks like
                        you, Fred,&quot; she declared, after an earnest scanning of the wierd
                        little face. &quot;Why not call her Frederica?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman thought this clumsy, but Dorothy instantly assentedand the baby was
                        duly christened Frederica.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps it was because he was having less pressing business in town, but
                        whatever the reason, he began to stay at home moresurprisingly more. And,
                        being at home, he naturally fell into the habit of fussing with the baby, he
                        having the temperament that compels a man to <pb id="VAA2369-419" n="413"/>
                        be always at something, and the baby being convenient and in the nature of a
                        curiosity. Ursula, who was stopping in the house, did not try to conceal her
                        amazement at this extraordinary development of her brother&apos;s
                        character.</p>
                    <p>Said she: &quot;I never before knew you to take the slightest interest in
                        a child.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Said he: &quot;I never before saw a child worth taking the slightest
                        interest in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, well,&quot; said Ursula, &quot;it won&apos;t last.
                        You&apos;ll soon grow tired of your plaything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps you&apos;re right,&quot; said Norman. &quot;I
                        hope you&apos;re wrong.&quot; He reflected, added: &quot;In
                        fact, I&apos;m almost certain you&apos;re wrong. I&apos;m too
                        selfish to let myself lose such a pleasure. If you had observed my life
                        closely, you&apos;d have discovered that I have never given up a single
                        thing I found a source of pleasure. That is good sense. That is why the
                        superior sort of men and women retain something of the boy and the girl all
                        their lives. I still like a lot of the games I played as a boy. For some
                        years I&apos;ve had no chance to indulge in them. I&apos;ll be glad
                        when Rica is old enough to give me the chance again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was much amused. &quot;Who&apos;d have suspected that <hi
                            rend="i">you</hi> were a born father!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not I, for one,&quot; confessed he. &quot;We never know
                        what there is in us until circumstances bring it out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A devoted father and a doting husband,&quot; pursued <pb
                            id="VAA2369-420" n="414"/> Ursula. &quot;I must say I rather
                        sympathize with you as a doting husband. Of course, I, a woman,
                        can&apos;t see her as you do. I can&apos;t imagine a manespecially a
                        man of your sortgoing stark mad about a mere woman. But, as women go,
                        I&apos;ll admit she is a good specimen. Not the marvel of intelligence
                        and complex character you imagine, but still a good specimen. And
                        physically&quot; She laughed &quot;<hi rend="i">That&apos;s</hi>
                        what caught you. That&apos;s what holds youand will hold you as long as
                        it lasts.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was there ever a woman who didn&apos;t think that? and
                        didn&apos;t like to think it, though I believe many of them make strong
                        pretense at scorning the physical.&quot; Fred was regarding his sister
                        with a quizzical expression. &quot;You approve of her?&quot; he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;More than I&apos;d have thought possible. And after
                        I&apos;ve taken her about in the world a while she&apos;ll be
                        perfect.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No doubt,&quot; said Norman. &quot;But, alas,
                        she&apos;ll never be perfect. For, you&apos;re not going to take her
                        about.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So she says when I talk of it to her,&quot; replied Ursula.
                        &quot;But I know you&apos;ll insist. You needn&apos;t be uneasy
                        as to how she&apos;ll be received.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not,&quot; said Norman dryly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve got back all you lostand more. How we Americans do
                        worship success!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t suggest to Dorothy anything further about
                        society,&quot; said Norman. &quot;I&apos;ve no time or taste for
                        it, <pb id="VAA2369-421" n="415"/> and I don&apos;t wish to be annoyed
                        by intrusions into my home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you&apos;ll not be satisfied always with just
                        her,&quot; urged his sister. &quot;Besides, you&apos;ve got a
                        position to maintain.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman&apos;s smile was cynically patient. &quot;I want my home and I
                        want my career,&quot; said he. &quot;And I don&apos;t want any
                        society nonsense. I had the good luck to marry a woman who knows and cares
                        nothing about it. I don&apos;t purpose to give up the greatest advantage
                        of my marriage.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ursula was astounded. She knew the meaning of his various tones and manners,
                        and his way of rejecting her plans for Dorothyand, incidentally, for her own
                        amusementconvinced her that he was through and through in earnest.
                        &quot;It will be dreadfully lonesome for her, Fred,&quot; she
                        pleaded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll wait till that trouble faces us,&quot; replied
                        he, not a bit impressed. &quot;Anddon&apos;t forgetnot a word of
                        temptation to her from you.&quot; This with an expression that warned
                        her how well he knew her indirect ways of accomplishing what she could not
                        gain directly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I shan&apos;t interfere,&quot; said she in a tone that
                        made it a binding promise. &quot;But you can&apos;t expect me to
                        sympathize with your plans for an old-fashioned domestic life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly not,&quot; said Norman. &quot;You don&apos;t
                        understand. Women of your sort never do. That&apos;s why <pb
                            id="VAA2369-422" n="416"/> you&apos;re not fit to be the wives of
                        men worth while. A serious man and a society woman can&apos;t possibly
                        hit it off together. For a serious man the outside world is a place to work,
                        and home is a place to rest. For a society woman, the world is a place to
                        idle and home is a work shop, an entertainment factory. It&apos;s
                        impossible to reconcile those two opposite ideas.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She saw his point at once, and it appealed to her intelligence. And she had
                        his own faculty for never permitting prejudice to influence judgment. She
                        said in a dubious tone, &quot;Do you think Dorothy will sympathize with
                        your scheme?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t know,&quot; replied he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If she doesn&apos;t&quot; Ursula halted there.</p>
                    <p>Her brother shrugged his shoulders. &quot;If she proves to be the wrong
                        sort of woman for me, she&apos;ll go her way and I mine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, I thought you loved her!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What have I said that leads you to change your mind?&quot; said
                        he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A man does not take the high hand with the woman he
                        adores.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So?&quot; said Norman tranquilly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said his puzzled sister by way of conclusion,
                        &quot;if you persist in being the autocrat&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Autocrat?I?&quot; laughed he. &quot;Am I trying to compel
                        her to do anything she doesn&apos;t wish to do? Didn&apos;t I say
                        she would be free to go if she were dissatisfied <pb id="VAA2369-423"
                            n="417"/> with me and my planif she didn&apos;t adopt it gladly as
                        her own plan, also?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you know very well she&apos;s dependent upon you,
                        Fred.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that my fault? Does a man force a woman to become dependent? And
                        just because she is dependent, should he therefore yield to her and let her
                        make of his life a waste and a folly?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re far too clever for me to argue with. Anyhow, as I
                        was saying, if you persist in what I call tyranny&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When a woman cries tyranny, it means she&apos;s furious because
                        she is not getting <hi rend="i">her</hi> autocratic way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Maybe so,&quot; admitted Ursula cheerfully. &quot;At any
                        rate, if you persistunless she loves you utterly, your life will be
                        miserable.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She may make her own life miserable, but not mine,&quot;
                        replied he. &quot;If I were the ordinary mancounting himself lucky to
                        have induced any woman to marry himafraid if he lost his woman he&apos;d
                        not be able to get anotherable to give his woman only an indifferent poor
                        support, and so onif I were one of those men, what you say might be true.
                        But what deep and permanent mischief can a frail woman do a strong
                        man?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s instance after instance in history&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of strong men wrecking <hi rend="i">themselves</hi> through various
                        kinds of madness, including sex madness. But, my <pb id="VAA2369-424"
                            n="418"/> dear Ursula, not an instancenot onewhere the woman was
                        responsible. If history were truth, instead of liesyou women might have less
                        conceit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Youtalking this way!&quot; mocked Ursula.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Meaning, I suppose, my late infatuation?&quot; inquired he,
                        unruffled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never saw or read of a worse case.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Am I ruined?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. But why not? Because you got her. If you
                        hadn&apos;t&quot; Ursula blew out a large cloud of cigarette smoke
                        with a &quot;Pouf!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I hadn&apos;t got her,&quot; said Norman,
                        &quot;I&apos;d have got well, just the same, in due time. A sick <hi
                            rend="i">weak</hi> man goes down; a sick <hi rend="i">strong</hi> man
                        gets well. When a man who&apos;s reputed to be strong doesn&apos;t
                        get well, it&apos;s because he merely seemed strong but wasn&apos;t.
                        The poets and novelists and the historians and the rest of the nature fakers
                        fail to tell <hi rend="i">all</hi> the facts, dear sister. All the facts
                        would spoil a pretty story.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ursula thought a few minutes, suddenly burst out with, &quot;Do you think
                        Dorothy loves you now?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman rose to go out doors. &quot;I don&apos;t think about such
                        unprofitable things,&quot; said her &quot;As long as we suit each
                        other and get along pleasantlywhy bother about a name for it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the French window he paused, stood looking out with an expression so
                        peculiar that Ursula, curious, came to see the cause. A few yards away,
                        under a big <pb id="VAA2369-425" n="[419]"/> symmetrical maple in full leaf
                        sat Dorothy with the baby on her lap. She was dressed very simply in white.
                        There was a little sunlight upon her hair, a sheen of gold over her skin.
                        She was looking down at the baby. Her expression</p>
                    <p>Said Ursula: &quot;Several of the great painters have tried to catch that
                        expression. But they&apos;ve failed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman made no reply. He had not heard. All in an instant there had been
                        revealed to him a whole new worlda view of man and womanof woman of sexits
                        meaning so different from what he had believed and lived.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;re you thinking about, Fred?&quot; inquired his
                        sister.</p>
                    <p>He shook his head, with a mysterious smile, and strolled away.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> baby grew and thrived, as the habit is with healthy
                        children well taken care of. Mrs. Norman soon got back her strength, her
                        figure, and perhaps more than her former beautyas the habit is with healthy
                        women well taken care of. Norman&apos;s career continued to prosper,
                        likewise according to the habit of all healthy things well taken care of. In
                        a world where nothing happens by chance, mischance, to be serious, must have
                        some grave fault as its hidden cause. We mortals, who love to live at
                        haphazard and to blame God or destiny or &quot;bad luck&quot; for
                        our calamities, hate to take this modern and scientific view of the world
                        and life. But, whether we like it or not, it is the truthand, as we
                        can&apos;t get round it, why not accept it cheerfully and, so appear a
                        little less ignorant and ridiculous?</p>
                    <p>During their first year at the Hempstead place the results in luxury and
                        comfort had at no time accounted for the money it cost and the servants it
                        employedthat is to say, paid. But Norman was neither unreasonable nor
                        impatient. Also, in his years of experience with his sister&apos;s
                        housekeeping, and of observation of <pb id="VAA2369-427" n="421"/> the other
                        women, he had grown exceedingly moderate in his estimate of the ability of
                        women and in his expectations from them. He had reached the conclusion that
                        the women who were sheltered and pampered by the men of the successful
                        classes were proficient only in those things that call for no skill or
                        effort beyond the wagging of the tongue. He saw that Dorothy was making
                        honest endeavor to learn her business, and he knew that learning takes
                        timemuch time.</p>
                    <p>He believed that in the end she would do better than any other wife of his
                        acquaintance, at the business of wife and mother.</p>
                    <p>Before the baby was two years old, his belief was rewarded. Things began to
                        run betterbegan to run well, even. Dorothya serious person, unhampered of a
                        keen sense of humor, had taught herself the duties of her new position in
                        much the same slow plodding way in which she had formerly made of herself a
                        fair stenographer and a tolerable typewriter. Mrs. Lowell had helpedand
                        Ursula, tooand Norman not a little. But Dorothy, her husband discovered, was
                        one of those who thoroughly assimilate what they take inwho make it over
                        into part of themselves. So, her manner of keeping house, of arranging the
                        gardens, of bringing up the baby, of dressing herself, was peculiarly her
                        own. It was not by any means the best imaginable way. It was even what many
                        energetic, systematic and highly competent persons would speak
                        contemptuously of. But it <pb id="VAA2369-428" n="422"/> satisfied Normanand
                        that was all Dorothy had in mind.</p>
                    <p>If those who have had any considerable opportunity to observe married life
                        will forget what they have read in novels and will fix their minds on what
                        they have observed at first hand, they will recognize the Norman marriage,
                        with the husband and wife living together yet apart as not peculiar but of a
                        rather common type. Neither Fred nor Dorothy had any especial reason on any
                        given day to try to alter their relations; so the law of inertia asserted
                        itself and matters continued as they had begun. It was, perhaps, a chance
                        remark of Tetlow&apos;s that was the remote but efficient cause of a
                        change, as the single small stone slipping high up on the mountain side
                        results in a vast landslide into the valley miles below. Tetlow said one
                        day, in connection with some estate they were settling:</p>
                    <p>I&apos;ve always pitied the only child. It must be miserably
                        lonesome.&quot;</p>
                    <p>No sooner were the words out of his mouth than he colored violently; for, he
                        remembered that the Normans had but one child and he knew the probable
                        reason for it. Norman seemed not to have heard or seen. Tetlow hoped he
                        hadn&apos;t, but, knowing the man, feared otherwise. And he was right.</p>
                    <p>In the press of other matters Norman forgot Tetlow&apos;s
                        remarkremembered it again a few days later when he was taking the baby out
                        for an airing in the <pb id="VAA2369-429" n="423"/> motorforgot it
                        againfinally, when he took a several days&apos; rest at home, remembered
                        it and kept it in mind. He began to think of Dorothy once more in a
                        definite, personal way, began to observe her as his wife, instead of as mere
                        part of his establishment. An intellectual person she certainly was not. She
                        had a quaint individual way of speaking and of acting. She had the marvelous
                        changeable beauty that had once caused him to take the bit in his teeth and
                        run wild. But he would no more think of talking with her about the affairs
                        that really interested him thanwell, than the other men of large career in
                        his acquaintance would think of talking those matters to their wives.</p>
                    <p>ButHe was astonished to discover that he liked this slim, quiet, unobtrusive
                        little wife of his better than he liked anyone else in the world, that he
                        eagerly turned away from the clever and amusing companionship he might have
                        at his clubs to come down to the country and be with her and the babynot the
                        baby alone, but her also. Why? He could not find a satisfactory reason. He
                        saw that she created at that Hempstead place an atmosphere of rest, of
                        tranquility. But this merely thrust the mystery one step back. <hi rend="i"
                            >How</hi> did she create this atmosphereand for a man of his varied and
                        discriminating tastes? To that question he could work out no answer. She had
                        for him now a charm as different from the infatuation of former days as calm
                        sea is from tempest-racked seautterly different, yet fully <pb
                            id="VAA2369-430" n="424"/> as potent. As he observed her and wondered at
                        these discoveries of his, the ghost of a delight he had thought forever dead
                        stirred in his heart, in his fancy. Yes, it was a pleasure, a thrilling
                        pleasure to watch her. There was music in those quiet, graceful movements of
                        hers, in that quiet, sweet voice. Not the wild, blood-heating music of the
                        former days, but a kind far more melodioustender, restful to nerves sorely
                        tried by the tensions of ambition. He made some sort of an attempt to define
                        his feeling for her, but could not. It seemed to fit into none of the usual
                        classifications.</p>
                    <p>Then, he wondered &quot;What is <hi rend="i">she</hi> thinking of <hi
                            rend="i">me</hi>?&quot;</p>
                    <p>To find out he resorted to various elaborate round about methods that did
                        credit to the ingenuity of his mind. But he made at every cunning cast a
                        barren water-haul. Either she was not thinking of him at all or what she
                        thought swam too deep for any casts he knew how to make in those hidden and
                        unfamiliar waters. Or, perhaps she did not herself know what she thought,
                        being too busy with the baby and the household to have time for such
                        abstract and not pressing, perhaps not important, matters. He moved slowly
                        in his inquiries into her state of mind because there was all the time in
                        the world and no occasion for haste. He moved cautiously because he wished
                        to do nothing that might disturb the present serenity of their home life.
                        Did she dislike him? Was she indifferent? Had <pb id="VAA2369-431" n="425"/>
                        she developed a habit of having him about that was in a way equivalent to
                        liking?</p>
                    <p>These languid but delightful investigationsnot unlike the pastimes one spins
                        out when one has a long, long lovely summer day with hours on hours for
                        luxurious happy idlingthese investigations were abruptly suspended by a
                        suddenly compelled trip to Europe. He arranged for Dorothy to send him a
                        cable every day&quot;about yourself and the baby&quot;and he sent an
                        occasional cabled bulletin about himself in reply. But neither wrote to the
                        other; their relationship was not of the letter-exchanging kindand had no
                        need of pretense at what it was not.</p>
                    <p>In the third month of his absence, his sister Ursula came over for dresses,
                        millinery and truly aristocratic society. She had little time for him, or he
                        for her, but they happened to lunch alone about a week after his arrival.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re looking cross and unhappy,&quot; said she.
                        &quot;What&apos;s the matter? Business?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Noeverything&apos;s going well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Same thing that&apos;s troubling Dorothy, then?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is Dorothy ill?&quot; inquired he, suddenly as alert as he had
                        been absent. &quot;She hasn&apos;t let me know anything about
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ill? Of course not,&quot; reassured Ursula.
                        &quot;She&apos;s never ill. ButI&apos;ve not anywhere or ever
                        seen two people as crazy about each other as you and she.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2369-432" n="426"/>
                    <p>&quot;Really?&quot; Norman had relapsed into interest in what he was
                        eating.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You live all alone down there in the country. You treat anyone who
                        comes to see you as intruder. And as soon as darling husband goes away,
                        darling wife wanders about like a damned soul. Honestly, it gave me the
                        blues to look at her eyes. And I used to think she cared more about the baby
                        than about you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s probably worried about something else,&quot;
                        said Norman. &quot;More salad? No? There&apos;s no dessertat least
                        I&apos;ve ordered none. But if you&apos;d like some
                        strawberries&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought of that,&quot; replied Ursula, not to be deflected.
                        &quot;I mean of her being upset about something beside you. I&apos;m
                        slow to suspect anyone of really caring about any <hi rend="i">one</hi>
                        else. But, although she didn&apos;t confess, I soon saw that it was your
                        absence. And she wasn&apos;t putting on for my benefit, either. My maid
                        hears the same thing from all the servants.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is pleasant,&quot; said Norman in his mocking good-humored
                        way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you&apos;re in the same state,&quot; she charged with
                        laughing but sympathetic eyes. &quot;Why, Fred, you&apos;re as madly
                        in love with her as ever.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder,&quot; said he reflectively.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why didn&apos;t you bring her with you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stared at his sister like a man who has just discovered that he, with
                        incredible stupidity, had over-looked <pb id="VAA2369-433" n="427"/> the
                        obvious. &quot;I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d be away
                        long,&quot; evaded he.</p>
                    <p>He saw Ursula off for the Continent, half promised to join her in a few weeks
                        at Aix. A day or so after her departure he had a violent fit of blues, was
                        haunted by a vision of the baby and the comfortable, peaceful house on Long
                        Island. He had expected to stay about two months longer.
                        &quot;I&apos;m sick of England and of hotels,&quot; he said, and
                        closed up his business and sailed the following week.</p>
                    <p>She and the baby were at the pier to meet him. He looked for signs of the
                        mourning Ursula had described, but he looked in vain. Never had he seen her
                        lovelier, or so sparkling. And how she did talk!rattling on and on, with
                        those interesting commonplaces of domestic eventthe baby, the household, the
                        garden, the babythe horses, the dogs, the babythe servants, her new dresses,
                        the babyand so on, and so onand the baby.</p>
                    <p>But when they got into the motor at Hempstead station for the drive home,
                        silence fell upon herhe had been almost silent from the start of the little
                        journey. As the motor swung into the grounds, looking their most beautiful
                        for his homecoming, an enormous wave of pure delight began to surge up in
                        him, to swell, to rush, to break, dashing its spray of tears into his eyes.
                        He turned his head away to hide the too obvious <pb id="VAA2369-434"
                            n="[428]"/> display of feeling. They went into the house, he carrying
                        the baby. He gave it to the nurseand he and she were alone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It certainly is good to be home again,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>The words were the tamest commonplace. We always speak in the old stereotyped
                        commonplaces when we speak directly from the heart. His tone made her glance
                        quickly at him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, I believe you <hi rend="i">are</hi> glad,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>He took her hand. They looked at each other. Suddenly she flung herself
                        wildly into his arms and clung to him in an agony of joy and fear.
                        &quot;Oh, I missed you so!&quot; she sobbed. &quot;I missed you
                        so!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was frightful,&quot; said he. &quot;It shall never
                        happen again.&quot;</p>
