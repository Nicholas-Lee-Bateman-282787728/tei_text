            <p>The Cornfield Conference of 1938, held on Homer E. Capehart's farm in southern Indiana,
                    demonstrated a new unity and purpose in the national Republican party and marked the beginning of a
                    more conservative era in American politics.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> It was also a turning point for
                    Capehart. From that moment on he devoted much of his time to selling both the Republican party and
                    himself as the embodiment of its ideals. These activities culminated in his election in 1944 to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Senate where he remained for three terms, longer than any Hoosier Republican before
                    him.</p>
            <p>Capehart personified the success story of the American dream. As the son of a frugal Indiana farmer
                    he experienced strong doses of family affection, Christian teaching, and back-breaking work on a
                    small farm in <placeName>

                    </placeName> where his family moved to a tenant farm when Capehart was thirteen years old. His
                    childhood instilled in him a restless drive to succeed. Although his formal education stopped with
                    his graduation from high school in 1916, Capehart continued to learn. As a young <list type="footnotes">

                            bipartisan congressional coalition of conservative Democrats and Republicans that gained
                            control of Congress in 1947. Historian James MacGregor Burns labeled the coalition the

                    during World War I, he gained self confidence. Following the war he sold farm implements and
                    commercial popcorn and peanut toasting machines, and in 1927 he founded the Cape-hart Automatic

                    for use in commercial locations such as sweet shops, drug stores, and dance halls—the

                    turning each one over to play the other side. Renamed the Capehart Corporation, the company moved to <placeName>

                    </placeName> where it produced an expensive record player for use in fashionable homes, yachts, and
                        hotels.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The world wide business collapse which followed the Wall Street crash of 1929 temporarily shelved
                    Capehart's career as an entrepreneur. The Capehart Corporation had been expanding
                    production in 1932 when a drop in sales, a decision to stop dividend payments, and subsequent
                    disagreement with his board of directors—a group which held the controlling preferred
                    stock—resulted in Capehart's removal as president and loss of all equity in his
                    own company. Drawing upon his experience as a successful salesman and business promoter, Capehart
                    decided that the Depression had occurred because Americans, like his board of directors at the
                    Capehart Corporation, had become needlessly pessimistic. What the country needed, he thought, was an
                    attitude of optimism, individual self discipline, and willingness to produce and to sell goods.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was this simple, even naive, set of beliefs and his enormous determination that Capehart took to
                    Farny Wurlitzer, chief executive of the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company in North <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Tonawanda</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="nyu">New
                    York</region>
               </placeName>, in the summer of 1934. Capehart convinced Wurlitzer that he could lift

                    </placeName> company out of its desperate financial difficulties. Wurlitzer hired Capehart, and in
                    four years Capehart fulfilled his promise. He supervised the manufacture and sale of the colorful
                    and popular Wurlitzer juke boxes of the 1930s— activities which made Wurlitzer prosperous
                    and made Capehart a millionaire. With some of his new wealth Capehart in 1936 had the satisfaction

            <p>The Great Depression and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's faltering response to it turned
                    Capehart to politics.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> There is no available evidence that he was ambitious for
                    political office in 1938. A restless, energetic man who believed in himself, he enjoyed trying new
                    things, making new opportunities for himself. He was happily married, the father of three children,
                    comfortably rich from his earnings as vice-president and general sales manager of the Wurlitzer
                    factory in North <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tonawanda</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and pleased with his accomplishments. By 1938 he had begun considering the reasons for
                    his success and how to use his new wealth. Convinced that he had demonstrated the value of optimism,
                    individualism, and aggressive self interest in his own business activities, he concluded that if he
                    could apply these qualities to the nation's business the Depression might soon be over. The
                    political opposition to the New Deal closely reflected his views: he became active in the Republican
                        party.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Capehart's entry into politics coincided with the declining popularity of Franklin D.
                    Roosevelt and the New Deal. This drop in public esteem began as early as February, 1937, when the
                    president's plan to reorganize the Supreme Court rallied opposition.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                    Another blow came in the late summer of 1937 with a drop in stock prices and a dramatic increase in
                    unemployment. Businessmen across the nation flooded the White House with telegrams demanding that
                    the president do something about the situation. In response the administration opened an attack
                    against monopolists and profiteers, blaming them for the slump.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Ignoring the
                    advice of John Maynard Keynes that if the president antagonized businessmen "the
                    nation's burden will not get carried to market; and in the end, public opinion will veer
                    their way," Roosevelt turned for support to the impending congressional election.

            </p>
            <p>Capehart, who may have sensed the Democratic weakness, was ready to join the fight. But it was a
                    pragmatic businessman's opposition to the New Deal rather than partisan Republicanism which
                    moved him. He had decided that the economy was going back into a slump and that people
                    "were losing confidence in their government." He contended that neither party was
                    offering the correct solution—the New Deal providing security without opportunity, the
                    opposition party, as he phrased it later, proposing "opportunity without
                        security."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Capehart's decision to associate himself with the GOP was fortunate for the party:
                    Republicans needed all the support they could find if they were to exploit the difficulties of the
                    New Deal. In the 1936 election Democrats won the biggest presidential plurality in history, their
                    largest Senate majority since 1869, and their largest House majority since 1855. So badly were
                    Republicans shaken by the election that the editors of <hi rend="i">Fortune</hi> suggested that the
                    party go out of existence. Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, a leading Republican conservative, made the
                    astonishing remark in September, 1937, that he felt partly labels were not particularly important.
                    Newly elected national Republican chairman John D. M. Hamilton warned that Republicans had to

            <p>In the summer of 1938 Capehart became one of 215 members of the Frank committee.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> The committee set out to make an "honest and objective audit of the New
                    Deal," to "rethink, restate, and reinterpret to the nation the political and
                    economic philosophy" of the Republican party, and to "create a comprehensive
                    report of policy."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> In a progress report made in August, 1938, the
                    committee warned of a possible breakdown in the nation's economy and the
                    "disintegration of responsible and effective government." The party, it said
                    rather ambiguously, needed both to recognize its obligation to "youth and age"
                    through voluntary social and government action and to determine the "stimulations,
                    regulations, and freedoms" that will allow for sustained productivity.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Capehart, an excellent listener and a fast learner, was alert to the possibility that such
                    new formulations might provide an important new ingredient for the platform of the nearly moribund
                        GOP.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>The Frank committee's work stirred such controversy in the party that the committee decided
                    not to publish a final report and changed its purpose from preparing a statement of Republican
                    policy to making a more general study of the needs and desires of the American people.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> The confusion within Republican councils was thoroughly evident in the failure of the
                    Frank committee. The party clearly had an opportunity because of the troubles of the Democrats but
                    did not know how to use the moment to advantage. Capehart, a member of the subcommittee on finance,
                    had little say in committee decisions and was not pleased with the indecisive outcome.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>The Hoosier Republican party, as Capehart had already discovered, was in no less disarray than its
                    national organization. Indiana had a history of strong two-party competition, but Paul V.
                    McNutt's entry into the governor's office in 1933 marked a new dominance for the
                    Democratic party. McNutt pushed through the Reorganization Act of 1933 which centralized the
                    administration of state government and placed almost complete control of expenditures and patronage
                    in his hands.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Indiana Democrats added to their power through administration of
                    such relief programs as the Works Progress Administration, the Public Works Administration, and farm
                    subsidy payments. By the mid-1930s the party had become relatively prosperous from McNutt's
                    famous "two per cent club," which collected that amount annually from the salaries
                    of state patronage job holders.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> During these years Hoosier Republicans had
                    disintegrated into factions occupied with squabbles for control of the state organization and
                    appointments to the national committee. The rank-and-file was apathetic. Older members wanted a
                    return of the golden years of Coolidge and continued their support for former Senator James E.
                    Watson —pro-business spokesman for Indiana Republicans for over sixteen years and Senate
                    majority leader during the Hoover administration.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> By early 1938 a dispute over
                    who would be the next state chairman had caused <placeName>

                    where the state committee would find money for the upcoming congressional campaign.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fortunately for the Indiana GOP, Hoosier Democrats began experiencing even greater difficulties in
                    1937. Roosevelt's plan to increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court (which had
                    become a major obstacle to New Deal reforms) and the apparent failure of his economic program in
                    mid-1937 caused serious cracks in the Hoosier Democratic <list type="footnotes">

                    successful sales conventions. Early in July the state Republican committee began publishing advances
                    about the Cornfield Conference and its host, who personified the farmboy to riches aspect of the
                    American dream. "A country that permits a poor boy to work his way up is good enough for
                    me," Capehart would say. "If they [presumably the New Deal administrators] keep on
                    monkeying with it, they're going to make it impossible for a kid to do what I have
                        done."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Reporters enjoyed pointing out the unity in

                    periodical, <hi rend="i">Billboard</hi> magazine, reported: "Capehart plans to

            <p>Early on the morning of August 26 the site of the conference on Capehart's farm was ready.
                    Twenty-eight blue and white striped tents were arranged according to Capehart's blueprint
                    on a 120 acre freshly mowed alfalfa field bordered on the east by the Big Four Railroad tracks and
                    on the south by a county road. Corn had grown in the field in other years, and, for those who would
                    insist on accuracy, an adjacent field was filled with green eared stalks in full tassle. The large
                    tent would accommodate ten thousand people seated at tables. There were tents for each of the twelve
                    Indiana district Republican delegations, four for kitchens, one for headquarters, and one each for
                    radio broadcasters, the press, and Republican literature. Small tents sheltered the first aid <list type="footnotes">

                    circumstances. Unlike the other speakers, Capehart wisely addressed the concerns of a minority party
                    seeking a return to power when over twelve million Americans were unemployed and twenty million were
                    receiving public relief money.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> As early as 1930 President Hoover had called
                    for helping people in honest difficulties.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Six years later Landon had promised
                    to continue government relief, if elected, and the Frank committee had called for Republican
                    responsibility to "youth and age."<hi rend="sup">51</hi> Capehart now charged that
                    "Roosevelt has spellbound his believers into feeling that the Republican Party is
                    interested in only … the reduction of taxes; the piling up of profit for private
                    enterprise and the protection and ownership of property … that when Republicans get into
                    power again they will permit untold suffering and starvation and will NOT take care of the
                    unemployed and will champion NO social legislation." He rejected this reasoning and called
                    for a program to rally Americans dissatisfied with "the Roosevelt New Deal"
                    because it had deprived them of "the chance to live as their fathers, grandfathers and
                    great-grandfathers had lived."<hi rend="sup">52</hi> Then, speaking from his own
                    experience, he asserted that every American boy and girl desired to own a home, a business, or at
                    least to have a position of responsibility in private industry. But Capehart had also decided that
                    Republicans must compromise with the New Deal, accepting its proposition that every person has a
                    right to the minimum necessities of life. "The Republican Party," he affirmed,
                    "must have the courage to say to the people of America who continue unemployed through no
                    fault of their own, that it will guarantee to them adequate and intelligent relief in whatever form
                    is most appropriate."<hi rend="sup">53</hi> In these few words he indicated his pragmatic
                    willingness to support those facets of the New Deal which had won overwhelming public acceptance.
                    And he exposed the backwardness of the 1936 national Republican platform which had condemned

                    Landon's greatest failure of political imagination: the inability to project a Republican

            <p>Capehart answered the objections of those who would accuse him of simply borrowing the New Deal
                    program by saying that his Republican program would eliminate the notorious Rooseveltian
                    bureaucratic inefficiency—the jungle of "red tape, politics, waste and stupid
                    bungling, … favoritism and graft." And he hit the New Deal's most
                    serious economic failure by emphasizing that the Republican party would "dedicate its every
                    act and its very life to the end that these millions of people who have been able to obtain only
                    government relief employment will be given an opportunity for real employment in private

                    industrial society which recognized the place of the workers—the importance of their

                    businessmen: "Business interests in this country realize that their first responsibility is
                    to labor, and their second responsibility is to their stockholders. If they take care of their
                    responsibility to labor, then labor will take care of their responsibility to the stockholders. It

            <p>Capehart's statements, although generally well received by the crowd, went considerably
                    beyond his original businessman's emphasis on optimism, individualism, and aggressive self
                    interest. They reflected new concerns derived from his conversations with people such as Frank and <placeName>

                    country, nor a Socialistic country, nor a Nazi country, nor a Fascist country," he drew his
                    final distinction. "We cannot live under two systems of government," he said,

            <p>Capehart's maiden political address, perhaps the most thoughtful of the day and an
                    oratorical success, revealed certain weaknesses. Like the unpublished Frank committee report it
                    confronted the perennial problem of modern industrial societies—how to provide both
                    economic security and incentives to work and produce. But Capehart's speech contained no
                    proposals about how relief could be better administered and no specific program for obtaining the
                    expansion of private enterprise necessary to eliminate unemployment and the need for public relief.
                    Taking a position which he would in later years label "political realism," he
                    endorsed the best features both of the experiment he condemned and of the pre-Depression Republican
                    policies under which the <placeName>

                    tell how a Republican political leadership would bring the economic recovery necessary to American
                    capitalism, but like Landon and Hoover he expressed his eternal optimism that it could.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> Finally, his resort to partisan name calling, while perhaps politically
                    useful, revealed an unfortunate willingness to join the party in its appeal to the blind emotions of
                    the fearful rather than to the constructive proposals of the thoughtful.</p>
            <p>The immediate response was less to Capehart's address, however, than to the fact that the
                    Republican rally had taken place. No one could deny the national impact of the Capehart Cornfield

                    Democratic National Committee, wrote a special article to play down the affair. Published in
                    newspapers across the country, Michelson's response asked if the five thousand chickens
                    which Republicans consumed at the Capehart picnic had any relation to the two chickens in every pot
                    promised by Hoover. He predicted that the Democrats could stop campaigning and still have a majority
                    of eighty or ninety votes in the House of Representatives after the November election. The
                    "utmost variation" in the Senate, he said, could not involve more than "a
                    seat or two."<hi rend="sup">63</hi>

            <p>It is impossible to know the effect of the Cornfield Conference upon the national election of 1938,
                    but to Michelson's probable dismay the opponents of the New Deal made important gains in
                    November. The election increased GOP representatives by eighty, from eighty-nine to 169, and the
                    number of Republican senators by eight, from fifteen to twenty-three. Most of the defeated Democrats
                    were liberal New Dealers from industrial sections of the East and Midwest. Some eighty other House
                    Democrats were at best unenthusiastic about the New Deal. Of the sixty-nine Democrats remaining in
                    the Senate as many as thirty were now hostile to Roosevelt's programs.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> Forty-five of the eighty new Republican representatives were from the Midwest. Democratic

                    Democrats recognized clearly the danger of a resurgent GOP. Meeting at French Lick the day of the

                    candidates, Capehart continued the drum beat sounded by his Cornfield Conference speech. He attacked
                    government spending, cutting of production in time of scarcity, appeals to class hatred, relief
                    without restored opportunity, and failure to increase farm prices.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> As the
                    election neared, he and Willis repeated their message to almost four thousand Indiana Republican

                    of twelve congressional races and elected their candidate for secretary of state. The state senate
                    remained Democratic but house Republicans gained a slight majority. The total vote was second
                    largest in Indiana history. Republicans carried every rural congressional district except one and 85
                    percent of the rural counties. In their report to the national chairman state Democratic officials
                    spoke of conservative farmers disillusioned with the crop control program, of the WPA make work
                    programs which helped make farm labor scarce, and of the wages and hour law which hurt businessmen
                    running small factories. The Democrats complained that government leniency toward sit down strikes,
                    government spending programs which antagonized independent voters, and the so called Democratic
                    purge gave the Republicans "effective ammunition" with conservative elements.
                    While they did not mention the Capehart Cornfield Conference, the Democrats prophetically concluded
                    that "if the momentum gained by the Republicans … which the election more or
                    less set in motion is not checked through co-operation by our party, Indiana indeed will be a
                    doubtful state in 1940."<hi rend="sup">70</hi>

                    Michelson prophesied that the name of Homer Capehart would live "whenever politicians seek
                    a rural refuge."<hi rend="sup">71</hi> Michelson might have been referring to
                    Capehart's talk when he went on to say that Republicans would either adopt some of the New
                    Deal program or continue in the uncomfortable position of backward looking naysayers.<hi rend="sup">72</hi>

            <p>Almost immediately people began that most fascinating of political games—guessing about
                    Capehart's ambitions. They would not believe he was simply "sick and tired of
                    hearing people complain about the New Deal and do nothing about it." <hi rend="i">Billboard</hi> reported that should Capehart "run as a candidate thousands of admiring
                    coin machine men will be plugging for him to win."<hi rend="sup">73</hi> The <placeName>

                    national committeeman, candidate for the Senate, or candidate for governor in 1940.<hi rend="sup">74</hi> Capehart may well have had political ambitions by this time, but if he did he left no trace
                    of them in the record. He was flattered by the speculation about his personal involvement in party
                    activities. He was always happy when people noticed him and expressed their gratitude for his
                    efforts. It meant that he had made progress toward his goal of strengthening the Republican
                    opposition to the New Deal. But he probably knew that few political parties welcome a new member
                    into their midst and immediately offer him a nomination for political office. This is particularly
                    true when the new member, as had Capehart in his Cornfield Conference address, alarmed some of the
                    party leaders by proposing a new approach, one which adopted important parts of the opposition
                    party's liberal platform.<hi rend="sup">75</hi>

            <p>Capehart, nevertheless, continued to attract listeners with his candor, his speaking ability, and
                    even his wit. When critical journalists pointed out that the coin machine nickels which had made him
                    wealthy came from New Deal relief checks, he retorted jovially, "For a nickel in one of my

                    her abilities reach the top in any chosen field of endeavor." The New Deal "would
                    substitute for honest, private employment, government ‘made’ work at a
                    woefully small wage." Government should be more "generous with the needy
                    … guarantee relief to them … take them by the hand, both the old and the
                    young, and pull them up," but the truly American way was to give them private employment
                    and a chance to use their initiative. "To kill private industry in America,"
                    Capehart said, "is to kill us as a nation."<hi rend="sup">78</hi> It was the

                    certain power; cheap food; facilities for transporting man and matter; proximity to the market; a
                    position particularly healthy; the best and cheapest building materials; [and its location] in a

                    "nearly equal to those offered to cotton manufacturers." He asked various experts
                    in each field to read his pamphlet and requested their support "in the form of a letter for

            <p>That challenge was taken up by Lawrence. Son of industrialist Amos Lawrence, nephew of Abbott
                    Lawrence, and at thirty-five already the director of several banks and corporations, Amos A.
                    Lawrence's response commanded attention and, in a sense, represented the answer of New <placeName>

                    unreliable, disputed the availability of southern investment capital, and predicted southern labor

            <p>An editorial and a series of letters to the editor were published with Lawrence's article,
                    broadening the attack on James' credibility. Hunt himself labeled James' claims

            <p>In the next issue of <hi rend="i">Hunt's Merchants' Magazine</hi>, Lawrence added
                    statistics to the intensely bitter, personal attack, charging that James habitually had

            <p>James' defense showed not merely the economic competition of different manufacturing regions
                    and techniques, but a clash of social classes as well. James and Smith considered themselves
                    representatives of a new generation of self-made men, energetic, ambitious, and
                    iconoclastic—typical Jacksonians. They saw New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>'s upper class and its manufacturing monopoly as a block to their ambitions.
                    Conversely, Lawrence's criticism demonstrated that the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> graduate regarded James as an opportunist interested only in money and power.</p>
            <p>One irony of this debate was that for more than a decade some southerners had been expressing doubts
                    about the invasion of "yankeedom" and the ruthless, chaotic thrust of progress.<hi rend="sup">71</hi> One southerner, declining not only Smith's invitation to invest in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cannelton</settlement>
                    </placeName> but even to endorse the vision of a manufacturing future for the South, wrote,
                    "The brilliant prospect you see in the future can … be purchased only by mines
                    of wealth and seas of blood." That, he concluded, would be "paying too
                    dear" for the factory whistle.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> Even southerners who supported
                    industrialization, like William Gregg, believed their region could best work out its destiny without
                    interference. Gregg cautioned readers of <hi rend="i">Hunt's Merchants'

                    articles would prove disastrous for the town. Along with Smith he initiated a local news column
                    which first appeared in the paper in February, 1850. Titled "Things About Town,"
                    "Our Town," or "Local Review," the column was designed
                    "not so much for the sake of interesting our townsmen as to give persons at a distance
                        information."<hi rend="sup">76</hi> Mason acknowledged that rents were high, streets
                    muddy, and church attendance spotty, but he also reported that settlers and investors willing to
                    "take hold of things without gloves" could profit handsomely. News of local
                    construction and new businesses appeared alongside exhortations urging workers to leave the

                    much harder to attract. The capital needed to buy machinery and hire operatives was not forthcoming.

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>

                    sell stock "uphill."<hi rend="sup">82</hi> After several months without success,
                    James felt that "most of the banks, if not all" were
                    "prejudiced" against him. He proposed a change of tactics: the issuance of
                    bonds—short term loans to be repaid at a high rate of interest—instead of
                    selling stock.<hi rend="sup">83</hi>

                    had been spent; the cotton mill was a long way from opening; and there were no dividends in sight.
                    Furthermore, the town itself was hardly established. One church had been built, but there was no

                    </placeName> altogether must have occurred to some of its backers, and the directors must have
                    seriously doubted whether bonds would only catapult them deeper into debt.</p>
            <p>By the end of June, 1850, James' patience with the company had worn thin. The question was
                    simple: "Will we raise the money to carry out what we have undertaken … or madly
                    sacrifice all … ?" James belittled the directors' fears; he scoffed
                    that "this entire procedure would in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> be considered as mere boy's play" and bemoaned the lack of a
                    "spirit of enterprise and indomitable perseverance … [which] enriches New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>."<hi rend="sup">84</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tensions between James and the company, which surfaced with the strain of financing the enterprise,
                    had been building for several months. Perhaps Lawrence's charges underminded the
                    company's confidence in James' ability to manage the mill responsibly, but more
                    worrisome was James' heavy commitment to several other mill projects. It would not be
                    surprising if the directors feared that James' outside activities threatened their own
                    futures.</p>
            <p>The problem of factory labor was another source of tension. The directors favored hiring cheap,
                    transient labor to get the mill started immediately and also proposed not paying laborers'
                    relocation costs. James countered by arguing that "transient persons, without families to
                    fix them to the spot" would "pack their trunks and step on board the first passing
                    boat. But families selected with care," who "have invested their all in lots and
                    houses," he continued, "will stand by and abide the vicissitudes that may
                    occur." James promised that he would select "responsible families …
                    with the very best references," and he pledged that he would send "very few
                    Irish." As a further safeguard, James suggested that operatives would have to agree to a
                    code of conduct before leaving for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cannelton</settlement>
                    </placeName>. But to insure this stable and skilled work force, James said, the company would have
                    to pay transportation costs and provide suitable family housing —"small
                    tenements … which will take <hi rend="i">no</hi> boarders."<hi rend="sup">85</hi> The directors apparently relented: efforts were made to attract permanent workers and their
                    families.</p>

                    attested to. An inauspicious welcome greeted the newcomers who arrived without warning one night,
                    met only by a cold, December rain. Apparently James' letter announcing their arrival had
                    not reached agent Cook in time. During the following week more families arrived, all armed with
                    contracts specifying "<placeName>

                    have been finished before the operatives arrived, were not ready. Cook found that there was a
                    serious housing shortage, even when two or three families were crowded into accommodations planned
                    for one. In addition, the workers' furniture —including bedsteads—had
                    not arrived.<hi rend="sup">94</hi> The superintendent was equally disturbed, however, by the quality
                    of raw cotton which had arrived, cotton so poor that "the cloth made from it cannot

                    cash was needed once a month for the mill's payroll.<hi rend="sup">98</hi> Manufacturing
                    equipment presented continual problems. All supplies—wrenches, nails, screws, files,
                    wire, glass, pipes, hoses, pumps, ropes, varnish, oil, and dyes —had to come by boat from <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Without a machine shop or hardware store in town, the mill was isolated and
                    vulnerable. Missing or broken parts and the irregular supply of cotton and oil caused frequent
                    delays and reduced production. Even more ominous was the fact that after just three months the
                    mill's boilers became heavily encrusted with mineral deposits. Cook tried emptying the
                    boilers and scrubbing them down: the cleaning took a day and a half because "a great deal
                    of lime … had settled … and became very hard…."<hi rend="sup">99</hi> To his dismay, the scales reappeared regularly, often within a month. Cook
                    searched magazines and journals for a remedy and wrote to James and to steam experts all over the
                    country inquiring about possible antidotes, such as molasses or coal tar. "The mill is
                    doing very well," Cook bravely declared, "as far as it is
                        going…."<hi rend="sup">100</hi> Although Cook hoped that James would come up
                    with a lasting remedy, he had to struggle with the crusty deposits all through the summer.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1851 Mason published an editorial that preached sacrifice and cautioned against

                    … overwrought comparisons."<hi rend="sup">101</hi> In spite of his avowed belief

                    Despite assurances, however, that capitalists—the mill's
                    investors—"are not enemies of the laboring man, but [are] his friends,"
                    the newspaper's message was just the opposite: operatives were foolish, unreasonable, or
                    even dangerous.<hi rend="sup">106</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mason's articles also downplayed the delays to scrub out the scaled boilers, calling them

                        on.<hi rend="sup">108</hi> There were concrete signs by summer that the management of the mill
                    had failed to satisfy the directors. They rejected Cook's repeated requests to install gas
                    lights in the mill to extend working hours when the fall days grew shorter. The company was both
                    unwilling and unable to spend the several thousand dollars required to implement his plan to
                    increase production. Instead, the directors called for a "full accounting" of his
                    expenditures and for weekly statements of the mill's output.<hi rend="sup">109</hi>

                    sacrifices … are not appreciated on the part of the company, they will be by the
                    public…." As to the company's finances, James wrote Smith,
                    "You needed not give yourself any uneasiness."<hi rend="sup">110</hi> But his
                    confident assurances of more stock and bond sales were no longer sufficient to ease the
                    directors' worries. Smith wrote to several eastern business acquaintances to ask for their
                    impressions of the general.<hi rend="sup">111</hi> The reports must have given Smith little comfort.
                    While affirming James' honesty, his correspondents noted, as one put it, that James
                    "sometimes undertakes a very large amount of work and perhaps too much for him to give [any
                    one project] … beneficial … attention."<hi rend="sup">112</hi>
                    Indeed, 1851 was a particularly busy year for James. In addition to his many mill projects, he had
                    been elected during the spring to the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>The directors worried in particular about James' failure to cover the company's
                    credit notes. Although Smith's eastern sources termed the problem mere
                    "carelessness" and "nothing worse than an oversight,"<hi rend="sup">114</hi> and although James soon guaranteed that "the drafts have all been
                    attended to,"<hi rend="sup">115</hi> Smith's relief must have been tempered by
                    James' assessment of their business future. The general did not expect the mill to work at
                    full capacity, and certainly not to be successful, "for a long time to come."
                    Smith and the other directors were unwilling to accept James' explanation that only
                    "the low price of cotton and our own … perseverance" would improve the
                    balance sheet.<hi rend="sup">116</hi> Cook, the mill agent James had selected, increasingly became

                    operatives than I can employ to advantage"<hi rend="sup">117</hi> and forced him at times
                    to pay their living expenses until the mill could start up again. In addition, the quality of
                    high-priced cotton continued to cause Cook despair. "The cotton I have [had] for the last
                    forty days," he wrote, "was not fit to spin…,"<hi rend="sup">118</hi> The directors agreed that a better grade of cotton was essential if the mill was to
                    run efficiently, and so they replaced the mill's supplier with another <placeName>

            <p>Smith admitted that he was "not competent to say … whether the delays and
                    difficulties … are Cook's fault or not." But, Smith complained, Cook
                    was not a leader, "a man to command the respect … of his operatives."
                    Cook could not "represent the model mill of the West," Smith said, because he
                    lacked "moral standing." The flaw was not one of character, Smith conceded, but
                    one of appearances. "We can best be served by a man who takes our interest in hand on
                    Sunday as well as week days," Smith wrote, confiding, "I swear, and drink good
                    whiskey, and don't often go to church —but I always give preference to a man who
                    is not profane who does not fancy whiskey, … and who does go to
                        church…."<hi rend="sup">121</hi> Unconvinced by Cook's protests

                    stockholder that if the mill did not soon show a profit, "we will turn out agents and

                    and his own fortune as well. He immediately sent his brother, Ballard, to investigate the rumors and
                    to safeguard the companies' bonds which James held.<hi rend="sup">126</hi> James'
                    subsequent explanation of the matter denied any irresponsibility or financial instability. The
                    incident was one of loyalty and honor, James said: in covering a friend's debts, he himself
                    had become overextended.<hi rend="sup">127</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Smith and the directors, however, were unwilling to write off the collapse as a generous
                    sleight-of-hand. They pressed James to draw up an accounting and to meet with them in
                        mid-October.<hi rend="sup">128</hi> In the meantime, the directors themselves settled on a
                    change of course.<hi rend="sup">129</hi> At the annual meeting in September they agreed to fire Cook
                    and to lease the mill to Newcomb &amp; Brothers, the firm's new cotton suppliers. When
                    told of the change, James was furious. "I shall consider that act," he fumed,
                    "as severing the last link in the chain that binds us together."<hi rend="sup">130</hi> Undoubtedly, that was just what the directors had intended. In less than a year operating
                    under James' and Cook's administration, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cannelton</settlement>

            </p>
            <p>An editorial in the <hi rend="i">Economist</hi> illustrates how the change in management was
                    explained to the stockholders. In assessing the "Difficulties of Those Who Plan Worthy
                    Enterprises," James was anonymously but unmistakably described as a
                    "reformer" and an "inventor," one "not so well adapted
                    to guide, to regulate, and to manage as to project and start an enterprise…." It
                    is likely that Smith wrote this farewell to his former ally, noting with sadness that "the
                    projector is made responsible for … [the] temporary failure of his truly laudable
                        efforts."<hi rend="sup">132</hi> Smith might have cast James as the scapegoat for <placeName>

                    that just such a portrayal was a distinct possibility.<hi rend="sup">133</hi> That James was treated
                    instead with respect probably reflects Smith's recognition that the two enterpreneurs
                    shared many characteristics. At heart, both men were promoters, and, as Smith noted, a promoter
                    encourages people to "expect too much." Once disillusioned, "people
                    desert [him] and do not aid him in tough times."<hi rend="sup">134</hi> In part, the
                    editorial may have been dictated by internal political considerations. In the shake-up, Smith had
                    been elected president of the mill company and undoubtedly hoped he would receive more support in
                    "tough times" than James had. The spirit of reconciliation was also designed to
                    soothe investors. Some must have been shaken by James' outburst at hearing of the
                    mill's transfer that he would "rather see [the mill] stand idle" than
                    relinquish control of it.<hi rend="sup">135</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fact, the mill did stand idle for most of September, 1851, but not by James' command. A
                    late summer drought so reduced the town well that there was not enough water to stock the
                    mill's boilers.<hi rend="sup">136</hi> In addition to lost profits, each day the mill was
                    closed meant less work—and therefore less pay—for the mill operatives. <hi rend="i">Economist</hi> editor Mason proposed that under the circumstances the company should
                    open an operatives' library. He reminded management that books would bring happiness to
                    "operatives now discontent." Reading was a better use of "leisure
                    time," Mason concluded, than idleness or "vituperative conversation."<hi rend="sup">137</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no indication that the company gave Mason's proposal serious consideration. The
                    drought did force the company, however, to build a water works and canal from the <geogName>Ohio
                        River</geogName> to the mill, providing what was hoped would be a better quality and more
                    consistent supply of water.<hi rend="sup">138</hi> When the mill started up again in late September,
                    wage disputes quickly precipitated a strike. Although James' original contracts had
                    promised wages "at the highest price then paid at <placeName>

                    depressed. While conceding that "the unsteadiness of work" understandably
                    "aggravated" workers' complaints, editor Mason lashed out at the strike
                    leaders. Without these "villains," who "spread false rumors in order to
                    increase discontent" and "inflame the operatives," Mason claimed, there
                    would not have been any public meetings of the operatives, "inflammatory
                    harrangues," threats and intimidations, or "resolutions not to work
                    passed." Mason saw in the brief three-day strike a "war against prosperity,
                    against all order—against the very existence of society." Repeating that
                    "the cotton mill company and the lessees of the factory are strong and true friends of the
                    operatives," Mason warned, "We are not ready to succumb to anarchy …
                    [or] to swear eternal hatred and enmity to those who seek to give employment to the industrious and
                    the needy."<hi rend="sup">139</hi>

            <p>With the Newcombs' take-over in mid-September, 1851, Mason had remarked, "the

                        compete…."<hi rend="sup">140</hi> And for a month after the strike ended

                    the American Cannel Coal Company announced plans to rent gardens and pasture land to operatives in

                    cotton planter, J. C. Ford, the Newcomb brothers loaned the company large sums until 1853, when they
                    purchased outright control. The New- comb family controlled the mill until the 1880s, making a
                    handsome fortune after the Civil War from its cheap cotton cloth and by selling coal from the leased
                    mines to river steamers.</p>

                    South into an industrial future—had ended in failure. Mason blamed James'
                    distant and distracted leadership. James, in turn, felt he had been undercut by "traitors
                    in our own camp," short-sighted profiteers who lacked a sustained commitment to the
                        experiment.<hi rend="sup">143</hi> Smith attributed the failure to plans proposed "in

                    particularly its quality—which were not considered in the venture's initial
                    plans. Most importantly, the supposed advantages of steam manufacturing rested on a number of

                            ammunition. In 1860, he offered his services to any southern manufacturing enterprise, but

            <p>Abraham and James Andrew departed at once to inspect this land and find a suitable location for a new

                    gap in an otherwise densely timbered landscape that opened westward on a stretch of fertile soil
                    dotted with gem-like lakes. This promising expanse of terrain already bore the name "Door <placeName>

                    founders agreed should be given the French name. Upon presentation of the act of incorporation,
                    however, one of the solons arose to inquire what the proposed designation signified and then
                    objected with the words: "Well, then, why not call it <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Door county</region>

                    descriptions of the common but severe hardships of bad weather, poor roads, and slow, often broken
                    communications, the Andrew correspondence of the early 1830s reveals the isolation, loneliness, and
                    uncertainty faced by the early settlers of Indiana in building towns.</p>
            <p>The correspondence also describes the opportunities. As late as 1832, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> was merely a cluster of cabins sheltering perhaps a hundred permanent settlers and not
                    yet a major port on the Great Lakes. The possibility of making <placeName>

                    </placeName> a railroad and shipping center occurred to several county residents. In 1832 Major
                    Isaac C. Elston platted a lakeport for the county, designating it portentously as "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan City</settlement>
                    </placeName>," even though it consisted mainly of sand bars and a large marsh.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The overriding necessity, of course, was to connect <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Michigan City</settlement>
                    </placeName> by rail or canal (or both) with inland rivers. As early as February, 1832, a syndicate
                    of the county's founding citizens, including Major Elston and Abraham Andrew, incorporated
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Railroad. Later Andrew joined several other citizens in chartering the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>
                    </placeName> Canal and Railroad Company to build either a canal or railroad connecting <placeName>

                    </placeName>. These and numerous other ventures achieved only a paper existence. The Panic of 1837
                    ended or delayed construction, and it proved impossible to persuade the state legislature at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to fund these ventures directly or place the full faith and credit of the state behind
                    the bond issues necessary to finance them.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> These were the grounds for
                    Andrew's exasperated outburst in his letter to his wife from Indianapolis. By that time,
                    the state government had in fact raised $10,000,000 to finance canal and rail
                    development, but had devoted the lion's share of the proceeds to the Central Canal, to join
                    the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> with the <placeName>

                                    proceeded in the direction of fort wayne and about 40 miles this side met three
                                    quakers who tole me that on Tuesday they met you on the other side of fort wayne and

                                    reflect upon my situation as a Citizen of the Door—the question was with
                                    us will you run off or will you stay &amp; protect our property &amp;
                                    persons I could not do else than pledge myself to stay and as soon as I hear you are

                        <salute>My Dear Viola,</salute>
                        <p>I have written several letters to James &amp; once or twice to you since you left
                                    but think it probable you have not recd any of them previous to this, as on my
                                    arrival here yesterday I was informed the mails were stoped in consequence of the
                                    Contractor having failed—to recapitulate the contents of all of them
                                    would be tedious and as they will probably come to hand sometime <placeName>

                                    </placeName>not undertake it—But can inform you that we have on the Door
                                    Praire survived our fright and all become pretty well satisfied there had been no
                                    real danger—</p>
                        <p>We at different times have had various reports and many of the people governed
                                    themselves accordingly and run away one day &amp; back the next—your

                                    them— that it appears the further from real Danger the worse the news and
                                    greater the fears of the people—</p>

                        <p>There is scarcly a settlement, Village or Praire in the whole country but what people
                                    have built fortifications, <hi rend="i">twentifications</hi> or tens—but
                                    generally when sufficiently alarmed to commence fortifying they would suffer their
                                    imaginations to picture danger in such colusus that they would run off before
                                    finishing any of them, consequently they (the twentifications) are a source of
                                    considerable merriment now that the <hi rend="i">War</hi> is over—</p>
                        <p>If James comes on and brings his family you <hi rend="i">may</hi> come along if you
                                    would rather do so but if satisfied I think it best you should stay there until such
                                    times as I can have a better house &amp;c—and I think James had
                                    better leave his family— as our business is I cannot leave here until
                                    after James comes out unless there should be something the matter with you in which
                                    case write to me immediately—should you need it for any purpose
                                    don't hesitate to call on James for money—I have written to him
                                    that you would want some—I think if you are content Fathers will be the
                                    best place for you to stay at—</p>
                        <p>you may expect to hear from me frequently if the mails get to running again if not it
                                    will be only as opportunity may offer like the present of sending a letter into the

                                    accordingly made my arrangements for starting to morrow morning, but in consequence
                                    of the thaw it is impossible to get along the <placeName>

                                    to let a horse break through—I have been unsuccessful in finding Mr.

                                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                                    </placeName>—the emporium of the United states I arrived here yesterday
                                    evening and have been looking on this fore noon—it is a great
                                    city— yet it falls far short of my expectations—it lies so
                                    level &amp; there is such a sameness in the buildings and streets that travel
                                    were [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] you may it still presents what you have seen or what is
                                    so similar that one might be led to believe he was traveling over the same grounds a
                                    longer residence and more familiaraty may change my "first
                                    impressions" and enable me to distinguish the different parts and see it as
                                    it is <pb n="314" id="VAA4025-073-4-068"/> a tremendious City Where all the <hi rend="i">wealth</hi> and all the <hi rend="i">poverty</hi> are strangely thrown
                                    together—where many of the Virtues and probably all the vices of our
                                    nature are to be met with—</p>
                        <p>And perhaps nothing has struck me with as much force as the travelling females since
                                    I came into <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York State</region>
                                    </placeName>— nothing but women and <hi rend="i">Band Boxes</hi> in every
                                    stage, every rail Road Car &amp; Every Steam Boat—Verily the men are
                                    more indulgent here, or the Ladies have more power of asserting and maintaining
                                    their rights than they have in the "<hi rend="i">far West</hi>"
                                    —But one thing is certain they have not got many very pretty women here
                                    or if they have the pretty ones stay at home</p>
                        <p>having done nothing as yet toward my mission I can say nothing about returning shall
                                    probably visit <placeName>

                        <salute>Dear Viola,</salute>
                        <p>I have devoted the past week to the object of my mission but with no very flattering
                                    prospects ahead of me of success— but of this mum. I have written the
                                    particulars to Genl Orr<hi rend="sup">3</hi> and if he sees proper to make it public
                                    so be it but my own view of the subject is that we can't tell here,
                                    "what a day may bring forth" in the money market consequently it
                                    will have no good effect at home either to raise their expectations or arouse their
                                    fears—I expect to keep Genl Orr advised of the state of affairs as
                                    "I understand them" from time to time—My present
                                    impression is that nothing can be done here for some 3 or 4 months and if after
                                    Visiting Phildelphia (which I expect to do this week) I shall continue of the same
                                    opinion—the probability is I shall return home and come back here in the
                                    fall or winter if it is the wish of my employers that I should make a second

                        <p>To comply with my promise in the letter of this morning I now write you—I

                                    design is to be at the top a Weeping Willow, an urn with a little girl (intended for
                                    his sister) inclining against it—a raise oval below with the inscription

                                    progress from here will be rapid and perhaps not afford me an opportunity of again

                                    home—although I am convinced that our business can be as well attended to
                                    without <list type="footnotes">

                                    return home—nor could I I suppose convince them that to remain will be of
                                    little use—I could tell them I do want to see Viola &amp; Maria

                                    them with it—But in truth Viola I think if you would exercise a little
                                    more government over me when at home it would be better for us both—you
                                    have the power to keep me there &amp; you know it—perhaps that is the

                                    you—there is no necessity for it— and yet I do it time
                                    &amp; again—with my eyes open to the consequences —Why, do
                                    I do it—I don't know truly—it is <hi rend="i">fate!

                                    Operation"—I called this morning on the Agent of the line of
                                    Canal Boats by which I shipped the Beef from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Buffalo</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and learn that 300 Bbls have passed on—399 Bbls that ought
                                    to have been here yesterday is detained a few miles above in the Canal in
                                    consequence of a Breach in the Canal— They are repairing the Breach But
                                    the weather is so cold it is <hi rend="i">very</hi> doubtful if they let the water
                                    in again this fall—the consequence will be that 609 of the Beef will not
                                    get through untill next april</p>
                        <p>I will remain here untill I ascertain what will be the result &amp; then proceed
                                    to <placeName>

                                    </placeName>—if the Canal is closed for the winter—all I can
                                    do is to make Sale of the 300 Bbls that has got through &amp; then return
                                    home—and come back in the Spring to attend to the rest of

            <p>This small volume publishes the papers presented at the second Indiana American Revolution
                    Bicentennial Symposium, held at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University in May, 1976, and jointly sponsored by the Indiana American Revolution
                    Bicentennial Commission and the Indiana Historical Society. The transformation from lecture to essay
                    was smoothly made—the essays being uniformly well written and the book reflecting the
                    high editorial standards of the Indiana Historical Society.</p>
            <p>The lead essay by John Francis McDermott is a defense of the early French colonists of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois County</region>
                    </placeName>. McDermott proposes that far from being the "restless misfits and lawless
                    adventures" portrayed in early travel accounts, the French settlers were actually
                    "energetic men of business, substantial farmers, and people of education and
                    culture…" (pp. 26–27). While he presents considerable evidence to
                    support his contention, McDermott's main purpose is to urge others to search out the true
                    history of the French common folk in local manuscript records: marriage contracts, estate
                    inventories, business and legal documents. To aid in this work he presents a brief bibliographic
                    guide to published and manuscript sources on the daily lives of individual settlers.</p>
            <p>George C. Chalou's essay is an excellent account of George Rogers Clark's impact on
                    the Indian tribes of the Old Northwest. Without attempting to either debunk or exaggerate
                    Clark's achievements, Chalou traces the fluctuating fortunes of both red and white men
                    along the Revolutionary frontier. He concludes that Clark managed to achieve a stalemate with the
                    Indians, neutralizing some and antagonizing others. This was no small accomplishment considering
                    Clark's resources.</p>
            <p>George M. Waller presents an overview of American strategy in the West during the Revolution. Waller
                    concludes that while Clark failed in his main objective of capturing <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> he succeeded in "intimidating large numbers of Indians and thereby protecting
                    the American settlements" (p. 62)—a conclusion that partially contradicts
                    Chalou's essay. <pb n="320" id="VAA4025-073-4-074"/> The evidence is rather overwhelming
                    that Clark did not "win" the West for the new nation, and Waller can only present
                    the next best argument—that Clark managed not to lose it either.</p>
            <p>Dwight Smith's essay places Clark's campaigns within the context of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> peace negotiations and shows that the winning of the West owed more to Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s wiles and the international balance of power than to Clark's
                    heroics.</p>
            <p>John H. Long uses Clark's campaign as a case study to show how useful maps can be in
                    understanding historical events and how dangerous they can be to the unwary. Long contends that the
                    cartographic dimension affords "a better perspective not only on historical events
                    themselves but also on what they could and did mean to contemporaries and under what
                    circumstances" (p. 86).</p>
            <p>To the lay reader who knows nothing of this period these essays will be of little use, since they
                    assume considerable background knowledge. The scholar specializing in this area will likewise find
                    the essays of marginal use since they present little that will not be familiar. However, that large
                    body of readers in between, especially those interested in this fascinating era of Indiana history,
                    will find these essays most informative.</p>

            <p>Most historians know Carl W. Condit as a distinguished specialist on the evolution of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> building techniques and architecture. In <hi rend="i">The Railroad and the City</hi> he
                    returns with obvious pleasure to the city where he spent his first thirty-one years. The result is a
                    detailed and scientifically sophisticated history of in-town railroad facilities in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Queen City</settlement>
                    </placeName> of the West.</p>
            <p>The strengths of the book are clear. It is first a work of meticulous scholarship on the
                    technological development of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> railroads. The central interpretive theme is the influence of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s topography—its river, its stream valleys, and its
                    hills—on the design of railroad terminals, bridges, belt lines, and electric railway
                    systems. Although <pb n="321" id="VAA4025-073-4-075"/> residents of soggy <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName> might argue, he makes a strong case that "no <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">American city</settlement>
                    </placeName> has been more profoundly shaped by its geological history" (p. xi). The major
                    thrust of the narrative concerns repeated efforts to find a suitable site and adequate financial
                    support for a single union station, efforts which culminated in the opening of the magnificent <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> Union Terminal in 1933. The final chapter on the Union Terminal project, which relates
                    specific decisions to the state of the art in railroad engineering and to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s continuing importance as a gateway for interregional rail traffic, is
                    especially wide-ranging.</p>
            <p>Because Condit is most interested in the technical problems of bringing railroads into a compact
                    city, the book does not meet the promise of its subtitle. There is no clear definition for the word
                    "urbanistic" ("pertaining to the urban way of life" and
                    "pertaining to city planning" are dictionary alternatives) and no
                    "history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>." Indicative of the narrow focus is the very limited use made of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers, of booster literature, or of scholarship on local politics and government.
                    There are references to the impact of railroad location on central commercial activities,
                    manufacturing, and suburban housing, but no analysis of the interrelationships. Nor is there
                    attention to entrepreneurial decisions behind nineteenth century company organization, to changing
                    visions of the city's future held by its elite, to the activities of city planners and
                    administrators in the twentieth century, or to other aspects of the political and economic context
                    for railroad building. With his eyes fixed on the track ahead, Condit also ignores the impact of
                    river trade on land use patterns and underestimates the importance of the <placeName>

                    corporate reports and railroad journals and make obscure data accessible to historians and train

                    of railroad building, a period for which technical data are limited and for which an exclusive

            <p>Progressivism was as much a social as a political movement, and nowhere was its influence more potent
                    than in education. Historians have alternately praised (Lawrence Cremin) and condemned (David Tyack)
                    the progressive movement for efficiency, centralized organization, and control by experts that
                    dominated public schools in the early twentieth century. But the exclusive emphasis on the
                    Protestant dominated public systems has wholly obscured the parallel development in metropolitan
                    Catholic schools. This book helps redress the balance. Although James W. Sanders hurries over the
                    explicit parallels, his thorough research in archival records, parish histories, and rich Catholic
                    newspaper files provides enough evidence for a major broadening of our conception of progressivism.</p>
            <p>With half <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s population to draw upon, though only a fraction of the city's
                    wealth, the parochial schools grew even more rapidly than the public schools. Before 1915 the story
                    was one of brick and mortar on the one hand, and traditional rivalries on the other. Not only did
                    the Catholics war against the threat to their culture represented by the public schools, but they
                    also fought internal wars along ethnic lines. Sanders, writing essentially a political history of
                    the struggles for ethnic identity, gives a clear, if repetitive image of parish power in the largest
                    Catholic archdiocese.</p>
            <p>With Harper, Dewey, Addams, Parker, Young, and Wirt giving the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> area the supremacy in educational leadership once held by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Berlin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it is surprising only that the city's Catholic leaders were so slowly
                    infected with reformist zeal. The situation changed dramatically in 1915 when George Mundelein began
                    his quarter century tenure as archbishop. <pb n="323" id="VAA4025-073-4-077"/> Emphasizing the need
                    for uniformity in an era of heavy intracity migration, Mundelein centralized control of the parish
                    schools in his own hands. His building committee decided where new schools would be located, while
                    his school board standardized curricula, textbooks, teacher training, testing, and educational
                    policy. Simultaneously the Catholics gained significant power within the public system, thus
                    deescalating the long unproductive cultural war.</p>
            <p>Mundelein did not, however, centralize control over the secondary and higher schools. Instead he
                    reversed the trend toward parish high schools and fostered the private high schools, run by
                    semi-independent religious orders, that to this day are the pride of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Catholics. Lack of lay leadership troubled Mundelein—in World War
                    I, a third of the privates were Catholic, but only 5 percent of the officers. Mundelein had no
                    solution to the problem. The laity had no voice; their role was to produce more money and more
                    souls.</p>

                    society into an urban, industrial nation. The book is a collection of exhibit material, but unlike
                    many exhibit guides, it is organized around an excellent interpretive text written by Perry Duis.</p>
            <p>In most respects, this is a fine book. The exhibit included a variety of materials chosen to
                    illustrate major features of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s innovative late nineteenth and early twentieth century environment.
                    Chicagoans' contributions to architecture, urban planning, literature, social reform, and
                    the merchandising of goods and culture are given separate treatment. Duis does justice to the
                    material. His essays provide descriptive overviews of each of these subjects, but he goes beyond
                    mere description. The essays attempt to place people, institutions, and innovations into the social
                    and intellectual climate of their times and to define <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    national context. Duis is especially successful at avoiding a parochial or antiquarian approach to
                    the material. The result is a happy combination of description and insight. A brief bibliography
                    provides suggestions for readers interested in further exploring <placeName>

            <p>This volume will replace <hi rend="i">A Pictorial History of Northwestern University,
                        1851–1951</hi>—an able account based largely upon an unpublished
                    manuscript by James A. James—as the most useful history of this private Big Ten
                    institution. The primary advantage of the newer work is its thorough treatment of the recent period.
                    Indeed almost one half of its pages discuss the years since 1939.</p>
            <p>Both authors served at Northwestern from the late 1940s until their recent retirements. Harold F.
                    Williamson is an economist and past president of the Economic History Association, while Payson S.
                    Wild is a political scientist who was the chief academic officer of the school from 1949 to 1973.</p>
            <p>Williamson and Wild succeed more in presenting their material skillfully than in always selecting the
                    most important developments to report. Their prose is clear, their use of quotations in the
                    narrative and illustrations (seventy-five pages of photographs) is unusually delightful in its
                    effect, and the quality and thoroughness of the reference aids are noteworthy; yet the authors give
                    excessive attention to the details of academic organizational structure and financial and physical
                    plant growth at the expense of the dynamic workings of the academic and religious programs. Only
                    infrequently <pb n="325" id="VAA4025-073-4-079"/> do they even briefly discuss the
                    "inside-the-classroom" learning processes and the effect upon the
                    students' development of the university's historic, if informal, connection with
                    the Methodist Church.</p>
            <p>The most engaging parts of the book are the descriptions of unique or unusual events in the
                    university's past: the determination of John Evans (for whom <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evanston</settlement>
                    </placeName> is named) and the other founders that this institution should become <hi rend="i">the</hi> Methodist university in the northwestern region of the country and their subsequent
                    efforts to realize this goal by acquiring the funds necessary to obtain a very large campus and
                    other sizeable real estate holdings in and near the most rapidly developing city in nineteenth
                    century America; the success of several presidents in enlisting the philanthropy of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s growing number of wealthy business families, including Gustav Swift, William
                    Deering, Elbert <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Gary</settlement>, <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
               </placeName> Ward, and Walter Murphy; the purchase in 1920 and the
                    development of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> campus; the serious merger negotiations with the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the 1930s; the conversion of the campus into a primarily navy training center for
                    50,000 men and women—including John F. Kennedy—during World War II; the
                    development of the Lakefill Campus (seventy-four acres) extension into Lake <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> in the 1960s; and the student protest movement of recent years.</p>
            <p>The book gives much attention to comparing the quality of Northwestern with other institutions. If
                    the authors are unduly preoccupied with measuring the continuing efforts of Northwestern to
                    "catch-up" with the prestigious universities, perhaps they can be forgiven for
                    they have a remarkable success story to tell. By many standards of measurement
                    —endowment, physical plant, faculty salaries and research skills, and reputation of
                    professional schools and graduate departments—Northwestern now stands as one of the
                    leading universities in America. Few private institutions as young as Northwestern can match its
                    resources and reputation.</p>

            <p>In their effort of rescue <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> women from secondary and subservient roles, Adade Wheeler and Marlene Stein Wortman
                    have undertaken an ambitious task—"to describe the contributions of many
                    different groups of women and to relate them to the larger process of historical
                    development" (p. 12). Acknowledging that their work has been hampered by a dearth of
                    readily available research and travels "only a few of the main highways" (p. 12),
                    the authors nonetheless produce a useful compilation (unfortunately marred by careless editing)
                    which spans <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> history from Indian days through today's continuing struggle for equal rights.</p>
            <p>The assertion that "sisterly" organizational activity, either formal or informal,
                    has preceded social and political changes in women's roles is central to the book. Given
                    this focus, it is not surprising that the first three chapters, in which Wheeler traces <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> women through the Civil War years, are the weakest, for organized efforts in this
                    period were rare. Following a sketch of white images of Indian women, Wheeler praises the
                    "support system" (p. 34) frontier women provided, yet portrays them as
                    "without choice and relegated to a life full of hardship" (p. 23). The possibility
                    of true partnership with their husbands, of cooperative striving toward common familial goals, is
                    unjustifiably dismissed. Wheeler also finds women in supportive roles during the Civil War. Here,
                    however, women's contributions to the Union cause, as in the Sanitary Commission,
                    introduced them to the world outside the home and, Wheeler argues, were thus more useful in
                    awakening their consciousness of women's issues than was frontier life.</p>
            <p>The most successful and most fully documented chapters are the last two, treating the period from
                    1870 to the present. Relying heavily upon the theses of scholars such as William Chafe, Wheeler and
                    Wortman illustrate how women in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> emerged from their particular province, the home. The authors place major emphasis on
                    legal, social, and economic advancement by educated, often economically independent, middle class
                    women, initially as a means to the improvement of the larger society and then as an end for women
                    themselves. Interwoven with this story is that of working class women, forced out of necessity into
                    the world and often more concerned with protection than equality. In the final section of the
                    narrative, the authors describe the ways in which groups of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> women are presently organizing to secure such diverse ends as passage of the Equal
                    Rights Amendment, <pb n="327" id="VAA4025-073-4-081"/> community involvement in neighborhood
                    planning, and better treatment of rape victims. The variety captures the amorphous, fragmented
                    nature of today's women's movement, in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, as well as the nation.</p>
            <p>Six "Essays in Practice," descriptions of current efforts written by women active
                    in them, follow the main text. While interesting and of possible value to future historians, these
                    essays unfortunately stand isolated from the general history and each other.</p>
            <p>This slim volume will be most useful to classroom teachers seeking specific information on active or
                    prominent women in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> history. Those searching for detail on "ordinary," ethnic, or
                    minority women or for new approaches to state and local history will have to look elsewhere. And
                    scholars interested in original conceptualizations will find few.</p>

                    </placeName>'s effort was part, was more than a matter of appearances. Originating in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1869 and taking root in America in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Buffalo</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1877, its whole purpose was to serve as a city's central record bureau for
                    existing benevolent societies to keep the "worthy poor" from living well on
                    indiscriminate, overlapping alms. This lack of wider historical knowledge is also exhibited in the
                    essays on government, utilities, the media, and education.</p>
            <p>There are other problems. Too heavy is the debt of the writers to the Rothrock study and to William
                    Rule's <hi rend="i">Standard History of <placeName>
                     <settlement type="city">Knoxville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>

               </hi>
                    (1900). The essay "Writers and Literary Clubs" is uninspired and has surprising
                    space imbalances. Thirteen lines go to Frances Hodgson, the creator of <hi rend="i">Little Lord
                        Fauntleroy</hi> (1886) with seven lines each, mostly titles of some of their works, to Joseph
                    Wood Krutch and James Agee. While one learns that Hodgson and her sisters "picked wild
                    grapes to sell in the market" for paper and postage "to send off her
                    stories" (p. 448), no mention is made of Agee's pioneer film criticism. He is
                    titled "perhaps [!] the most famous of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Knoxville</settlement>
                    </placeName> writers" (p. 449). "Commerce and Industry" is dismissed in
                    four unsubstantiated pages and contains the exaggerated assertion that Knoxville is a
                    "great business and industrial city…" (p. 413).</p>
            <p>The lead essay, "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Knoxville</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s History: An Interpretation," though not very interpretive and
                    slimly buttressed by citation, is well-written and useful. "Transportation
                    Development" is competently done as are articles on the theater, on architecture, and on
                    the fine arts. The best essays are "Government" and "Banking
                    Developments, 1811–1976." The former, marked by an assiduous use of primary
                    sources, will be invaluable to other students. The bank study, written by a professor emeritus of
                    finance, includes the explanations necessary to clarify an often arcane subject.</p>
            <p>A long section on "Prominent Knoxvillians" includes biographical material on
                    individuals only four of whom are well-known—Agee, Krutch, the man who invented the <pb n="329" id="VAA4025-073-4-083"/> "Dempster Dumpster," and General Robert

                    120 photographs. Whatever its weaknesses and while indeed "the study of <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s triumphal tour of America in 1824–1825 was one of the most
                    emotional, symbol laden, and culturally significant of all the patriotic events of the first half of
                    the nineteenth century, and as such it has had an understandable and enduring fascination for
                    historians, for history buffs, and for collectors of patriotic memorabilia. Marian Klamkin, whose

                    </placeName>'s visit.</p>
            <p>But mostly Klamkin's book is a day by day and town by town description of the tour itself,
                    one which draws heavily upon the published account of Auguste Levasseur, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s secretary and traveling companion. Readers learn that Lafayette arrived in a
                    given town in the early morning, was huzzahed in word and music, attended a military review, a
                    banquet, and the theater, greeted scores, and ended up going to bed much later than intended, only
                    to arise early the next morning to set out for the next town, where a similar welcome awaited him.
                    And on and on it goes. What is lacking here is any sustained attempt on the author's part
                    to go beyond the superficial details of the trip to get at its deeper cultural meaning. The
                    unfortunate result of this is that Klamkin's account of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s return, unlike the event itself, soon seems repetitious and even tedious.</p>

                    </placeName>'s tour has yet to be delineated, but Klamkin would have profited greatly from
                        <pb n="330" id="VAA4025-073-4-084"/> a more careful study of such recent works as Anne C. Love-

                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s grueling itineray needs greater insight than Klamkin has provided. An
                    abiding sense of the tour's meaning was, after all, what sustained the participants
                    themselves. Without that sense the tour would have been just one long and tedious ordeal both for <placeName>

                    audiences—collectors of patriotic memorabilia and students of the American
                    past—there is still a need for a scholarly book-length study focusing solely on the

            <p>An author of several expertly written books on mid-nineteenth century America, Stephen B. Gates has
                    now put together a one-volume biography of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> which general readers and some specialists will find quite attractive. It is similar to
                    the portrait of the Civil War President by Benjamin Thomas, so popular over the past twenty-five
                    years; and though it is no better in many respects, it draws upon the mass of literature published
                    from the early 1950s to the present, so that in this sense it is a fresh study. Like Thomas, Gates
                    does not footnote in the customary way but at the end of the volume refers to various sources, most
                    of them printed, that support segments of his story. Whether this technique helps or hinders the
                    reader may be a matter of opinion; this reviewer does not feel helped as much as he would wish.</p>
            <p>The principal merit of the work is undoubtedly its colorful, often exciting style which achieves
                    dramatic effect. Personal characterizations and skillful descriptions of scenes and events enhance
                    interest in the narrative—it is narrative more than analysis and interpretation. Still,
                    the author has a solid footing in general history and Lincolniana, enabling him to <pb n="331" id="VAA4025-073-4-085"/> avoid any noteworthy misstep. Among: instances of high literary quality
                    are his account of the debates with Douglas and his portrayal of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s daily routine and private life in the White House. Especially absorbing is
                    his detailed handling of the last days and hours of the assassinated chief executive.</p>
            <p>Gates depicts young <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> somewhat as the latter's friend Billy Herndon did: a human being not a saint,
                    not immune from anger, earthy language and anecdotes, pride, and driving ambition. As a rising <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> lawyer, married to an upper-class Kentuckian, he wanted to forget his humble background
                    and related miseries. For example, he disliked being called Abe, which must have reminded him of
                    that period. By the 1840s and 1850s he had gained a respectable standing in the legal profession and
                    in Whig politics as well, indeed was a powerful leader of his party in the state.</p>
            <p>Gates' <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> of the presidential years very much resembles the figure found in Randall's
                    enduring study. He was dedicated to maintenance of the Union at all costs, resisted Radical (here
                    labeled "liberal") pressure for emancipation of the slaves until he felt the time
                    was ripe, and was his own best general in prosecuting the war. A departure from older perspectives
                    is a far more sympathetic and extensive treatment of the role of blacks, particularly their
                    substantial contribution to victory on the field of battle. And the author straddles the fence
                    between Randall and Herndon with regard to Mary <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, viewed as a loving wife albeit an unstable, tempestuous one.</p>
            <p>On the whole, then, this is a highly interesting narrative, generally dependable, though cautious
                    where it ventures interpretation. It will probably be a staple of Civil War biography and history
                    for a long while.</p>

                    notes, tables, appendix, bibliography. $12.50.)</head>
            <p>This is a thin book, both physically and substantively. Less than twenty-three of its eighty-eight
                    pages are devoted to text, and much of the remainder is devoted to lists of congressmen <pb n="332" id="VAA4025-073-4-086"/> and senators repeated in different orderings along with their state,
                    party affiliation, and voting record on roll calls related to the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and
                    Fifteenth Amendments and to measures concerning Negroes from 1838 through February, 1864.</p>
            <p>The central question Glenn M. Linden attempts to address is the extent to which the votes of
                    individual senators and congressmen on roll calls relating to the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and
                    Fifteenth Amendments were in support of Negro rights and consistent with their previous roll call
                    voting on measures pertaining to Negroes. The book measures "support" by the
                    percentage of times an individual voted "pro-Negro equality" (p. 13) during his
                    terms of service and "consistency" by whether the percentage on roll calls prior
                    to 1864 differed substantially from the percentage on amendment roll calls from 1864 through 1869.
                    The book does not consider roll calls on other measures relating to Negro rights from 1864 through
                    1869 because "they were not useful in determining whether Congressmen who voted for or
                    against the amendments were acting consistently with their past records" (p. 8).</p>
            <p>One major shortcoming of this approach to "support" and
                    "consistency" is that it fails to consider the fact that there were substantial
                    shifts in voting patterns of certain individuals during the two periods in question. Nor does it
                    take adequate account of how much the issues themselves, public opinion, and the context of events
                    shifted over time. A Republican who maintained the same position from 1857 through 1867 was quite
                    likely to have appeared as "declining" in his support for pro-Negro measures in
                    the relative terms of voting on amendment-related roll calls. Furthermore, the method used to
                    describe such changes—listing the two percentages side by side—is much less
                    effective than a simple scatterplot would have been in showing change and consistency. The
                    conclusion that most members of Congress "did not significantly change their voting
                    behavior concerning blacks in the years from 1838 to 1869" (pp. 45–46) is at
                    best misleading.</p>

                    </placeName>'s attempt to relate support and consistency on Negro-related legislation to
                    individual background factors such as state represented, state of birth, age, and education is weak
                    and offers little new information. It is hardly surprising to learn that pro-Negro members of
                    Congress were primarily Republicans from the North and East who had a somewhat higher median
                    education than their Democratic opponents from border and western states.</p>

                    percentages. Such data can yield much richer information but only after a good deal more analysis
                    and summarization. The author's conclusion that passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and
                    Fifteenth Amendments displayed a larger measure of principle than politics is doubtless correct, but
                    the book does not furnish adequate evidence for that conclusion nor indicate why that might have
                    been the case.</p>

            <p>The ten Christian social reformers who are the protagonists of this study wore that label very
                    loosely, with wide variations of consistency and staying power. Christian Socialists, as distinct
                    from the more secular breed, shared an earnest ethical persuasion informed by the vision of a
                    Kingdom of God on earth. The kingdom was to be achieved not through class conflict or state coercion
                    but rather by compassionate altruism, or what one of them called "social love."
                    The disparity between the goal and the tactics chosen to approach it made its advocates highly
                    vulnerable to the charge of inflated idealism and impracticality. In Peter J. Frederick's
                    friendly but demanding assessment, their collective failure to match dreams with action is what
                    mainly binds them to- gether as a group.</p>
            <p>In succeeding chapters, William Dean Howells and Henry Demarest Lloyd are seen as incurably eclectic
                    and optimistic in their reformism; W. D. P. Bliss and B. O. Flower are dismissed as enthusiastic but
                    feckless proponents of reformist unity; Vida Scudder is treated kindly for her efforts to mix
                    college teaching with social service; clergymen Walter Rauschenbusch and George Herron are
                    contrasted in their diverging attitudes toward the efficacy of institutional change; Edwin Markham
                    is compared unfavorably with fellow poet Ernest Crosby, whose principled self-doubt arouses in
                    Frederick a shock of recognition; and finally the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Toledo</settlement>
                    </placeName> business-man-turned-politician "Golden Rule" Jones is portrayed as a
                    model of the practical reformer whose behavior set a standard <pb n="334" id="VAA4025-073-4-088"/>
                    against which the quixotic failures of the others can be measured.</p>
            <p>At first glance, Jones' inclusion in the group seems somewhat arbitrary—a device
                    by which to dramatize the lesson that middle class intellectual reform is inherently futile unless
                    "words" are justified by "deeds" and by saving contact with the
                    working classes. Jones passes the author's deed-test with flying colors, and in this
                    crucial difference lies his historical significance. Yet Jones shared with his fellow knights of the
                    golden rule an almost born-again faith in the utility of Christian benevolence and also a sense of
                    discipleship to their European mentors, Mazzini, Ruskin, and Tolstoy. The broad inspirational impact
                    of this trio on American Christian social reformers at the turn of the century is one of the
                    important findings of Frederick's study.</p>
            <p>Frederick writes with explicity presentist preoccupations. His book is "about the present
                    and about me," he warns. "Otherwise, there would have been no reason to write
                    it" (p. xv). Further he acknowledges what he calls "a quasi-New Left
                    perspective" (p. 271). This angle of vision presumably accounts for his relentless effort
                    to impose on his subjects a judgmental evaluation borrowed from the chastening radical experience of
                    the 1960s. Repeatedly he invokes the concepts of middle class guilt, self-isolation, elitism,
                    over-optimism, and inability to reconcile ideals and practice. These define the crucial failings of
                    his knights. His new left assumption, that progressive reform was significant primarily for its
                    stabilization of the political economy which the Kingdom of God promised to transform, serves to
                    validate the theme of failure.</p>
            <p>Thorough in his research, gifted in his prose, and candid about his preferences, Frederick has
                    produced an important monograph which is also a revealing historiographical document.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Affairs of State: Public Life in Late Nineteenth Century America</hi>. By Morton
                    Keller. (<placeName>

            <p>In recent years historians, led especially by the efforts of Samuel P. Hays, Robert Wiebe, and Alfred
                    D. Chandler, Jr., have been reexamining the nature of late nineteenth and early <pb n="335" id="VAA4025-073-4-089"/> twentieth century American history. Morton Keller's study is
                    an extremely valuable addition to this growing body of literature. The synthesizing works of other
                    historians have dealt primarily with economic and social changes, while slighting somewhat the
                    interaction between these changes and politics. Keller investigates precisely this overlooked
                    area— the public polity, in which he includes party politics, foreign policy, law, and
                    government involvement in the economy.</p>
            <p>Keller divides his study into two major part. The first covers the years 1865 through 1880. In this
                    period he finds "the wartime legacy of active, expanded government" to have
                    affected all aspects of the public polity "in Congress and the courts, in the victorious
                    North as well as the defeated South, in a broad range of social and economic policies" (p.
                    35). Yet, even as the Civil War boosted the power of the federal government and led to an increase
                    in its involvement in social and economic affairs, countervailing forces—localism,
                    laissez- faire ideas, and racism—were at work against the nationalizing and centralizing
                    forces. The second section deals with the relationship between politics and industrialization during
                    the 1880s and 1890s. Keller views economic and social changes as causing major alterations in the
                    public polity, but, again, he notes that there was widespread resistence to these changes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Affairs of State</hi> is an important book for anyone interested in the evolution of
                    American politics. Well written and organized, Keller's study brings together in a
                    readable, comprehensive volume information from a wealth of secondary sources. The extensive
                    footnotes provide guides for further reading. The most significant contribution of the work in this
                    reviewer's opinion is Keller's amply documented assertion that tension between the
                    old and the new underlay American politics in the four decades following the Civil War. Particularly
                    worth noting is his conclusion that localism, opposition to government involvement in the economy,
                    individualism, and the continuance of preindustrial values modified and slowed the nationalizing
                    tendencies present in American life. Keller's findings suggest that the American experience
                    was more complex than the works of other historians have indicated.</p>
            <p>For all its value, this study has a few shortcomings. Keller occassionally overstates his case.
                    Business and economic historians may question his statement that "the Civil War remains the
                    great watershed in the history of the American nation," with an "agrarian,
                    decentralized" nation on one side <pb n="336" id="VAA4025-073-4-090"/> of the divide and a
                    "nation of cities, factories, immigrants" on the other (p. 1). Most will probably
                    see more continuity in nineteenth century American economic development than does Keller. By the
                    same token, some historians may well question just how "distinctive" or
                    "new" it was for Americans "to call on government to assist economic
                    development" after the Civil War (p. 162). In fact, governmental bodies greatly aided
                    economic growth in earlier times, particularly in the realm of internal improvements. Despite his
                    generally encyclopedic range of knowledge, Keller sometimes neglects works which might have added to
                    his discussion of certain topics. For instance, his treatment of the silver issue might benefit from
                    some consideration of the studies by Walter Nugent and Allen Weinstein.</p>
            <p>Despite its few problems, <hi rend="i">Affairs of State</hi> is a superb book, a
                    "must" for those interested in nineteenth century American history.</p>

            <p>Sparked by his sympathy for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="vm">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> peace movement, David S. Patterson investigated activities of American peace groups
                    from 1887 to 1914. The result is a critical history of peace leaders and their failures, which is
                    heavily documented and makes use of quantitative data on key peace leaders. Using a chronological
                    approach, except for two chapters, Patterson examines the assumptions and programs of the leaders.
                    The peace movement reached its highest point on the eve of World War I, but peace leaders failed to
                    realize that militarism and nationalism were growing forces and not a vestige of the
                    world's uncivilized past. In short, the peace movement grew and prospered, but relatively
                    it lost much ground in the race against war.</p>
            <p>In an effort to bring meaning to an "extremely diverse, amorphous movement" (p.
                    ix), Patterson studies thirty-six leaders, a group chosen by position and consistent participation
                    at peace and arbitration conferences. He assigns the leaders to categories of pacifist, generalist,
                    world federationist (federalist), and legalist, but warns that some leaders moved from one category
                    to another and that others did not fit a <pb n="337" id="VAA4025-073-4-091"/> category. He concludes
                    that peace leaders had similar backgrounds: most were overwhelmingly urban, professional,
                    Anglo-Saxon and Protestant, and born east of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> and north of the Mason-Dixon line. Common values of elitism and unquestioning belief in
                    the reality of moral values as the mainspring of human behavior added to the bonds between peace
                    leaders. Still, the most distinctive characteristic of the peace movement in the pre-World War I era
                    was its heterogeneity (p. 181). Organizations had numerous approaches to peace, yet a major
                    characteristic of the movement was the "relative absence of overt controversy" (p.
                    195). Unity in the movement developed out of similar backgrounds and values and agreement on four
                    principles: periodic international congresses for discussions; the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> should be the leader in the world peace movement since it was a satiated, secure power;
                    the importance of law; and the need for a court of arbitral justice.</p>
            <p>Leaders with Indiana connections included David Starr <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> and May Wright Sewall, although the latter does not receive enough credit from
                    Patterson. The Peace Association of Friends, a <placeName>

               </placeName>, published <hi rend="i">Messenger of Peace</hi>, the most successful pacifist journal in the 1870s and 1880s, but its
                    leaders, William G. Hubbard and Daniel Hill, do not fit Patterson's mold. Another Hoosier
                    peace leader, Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Trueblood, was born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> and educated at Earlham College. Patterson agrees with the appraisal of Edwin Mead that
                    Trueblood was the "only professional peace worker in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, the only man who made service of the peace cause his vocation" (p. 28).</p>
            <p>Several criticisms are in order. Although Patterson writes well, several passages contain confusing
                    conceptual terms (for example, p. 158). And his criticisms of peace workers lead to contradictions
                    on more than one occasion. When he finds that peace leaders waffled on their antiwar statements, he
                    criticizes them for being too cautious and not totally committed to the ideals of the movement. At
                    the same time, he criticizes them for being too narrow and elitist and not being aware of
                    "practical peace" (p. 129) and political realities even though appeals to the
                    masses had little impact on policy.</p>
            <p>Patterson has written a thorough, solid work based on extensive research, and he does an admirable
                    job of analyzing the diversities in the peace movement and of clarifying many <pb n="338" id="VAA4025-073-4-092"/> of the changing principles and positions of peace workers during the
                    pre-World War I era. Criticism of this work has to be limited to the few tedious conceptual passages
                    and to the publisher's placement of over nine hundred notes at the end of the book. Also, a
                    list of forty-two abbreviations that vie with each other for similarity and the lack of a
                    bibliography should be noted.</p>

                    Inc., 1977. Pp. xiii, 177. Appendixes, tables, notes, bibliography, name index. $6.50.)</head>
            <p>These four books are part of Oceana's Ethnic Chronology Series, intended primarily for
                    secondary schools and community colleges. Although the series appears uniform, with standardized
                    titles and bright scarlet bindings, it should not be assumed that the books are identical in format
                    or quality. The content varies considerably.</p>
            <p>Two of the four are updates of previous editions. The "revision" of <hi rend="i">The Blacks in America</hi> simply updates the chronology. Exact dates are usually given, such
                    an important feature in a chronology that it is hard to understand why the example is so often not
                    followed in the rest of the <pb n="339" id="VAA4025-073-4-093"/> series. A grossly inadequate
                    bibliography, an outline of Afro-American history, a heterogeneous list of organizations, a very
                    good statistical section, and several other collections of information are included.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The American Indian, 1492–1976</hi> has 118 pages of chronology. The
                    appendixes include Indian publications, organizations, lists of prominent Indians past and
                    contemporary, and a short bibliography almost entirely limited to historical studies. The lists have
                    been considerably expanded from the 1971 edition, though without much updating of previous entries.</p>
            <p>Information about prominent Russian-Americans in many fields is woven into the thirty-one page
                    chronology of <hi rend="i">The Russians in America, 1727-1975</hi>. The documents section, which
                    makes up most of the book, contains largely extracts from a variety of articles. A short
                    bibliography is followed by lists of organizations, periodicals, and schools offering courses in
                    Russian studies. The Russian alphabet and a few Russian proverbs are also thrown in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Chicanos in America, 1540–1974</hi>, which is in painful need of proof
                    reading, has only twenty-one pages of chronology. Only the year is usually given, and many of the
                    entries are so amorphous (or so cryptic) that even to specify a year is cutting it a bit fine. But
                    exact dates could be given far more often than they are. There is no outline history, no list of
                    organizations or of individuals. The documents section makes up the rest of the book, except for the
                    bibliography. It includes seven articles, most taken from <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government publications, and a few assorted statements. The bibliography, however, is
                    relatively good.</p>
            <p>The uneven quality of these volumes makes it difficult to select from the series with any confidence.
                    The Chicano volume is a notable disappointment. The volumes on blacks and Indians are probably
                    useful although the updating is skimpy. The Russian volume is well done but by its nature of more
                    limited usefulness. The series is a good idea which could have been well executed with a little more
                    editorial attention.</p>

                    By John G. Clark, David M. Katzman, Richard D. McKinzie, and Theodore A. Wilson. <pb n="340" id="VAA4025-073-4-094"/> (Homewood, Ill.: The Dorsey Press, 1977. Pp. xx, 529. Maps,
                    illustrations, tables, bibliography, index. $13.95.)</head>
            <p>The authors of this unusual textbook attempt to show how "urbanization, industrialization,
                    expansion, bureaucratization, and their effects upon family structure, occupations, social
                    stratification, and demographic patterns… [affected] the lives of three previous
                    generations of American families existing in various socioeconomic-geographic situations"
                    (p. ix). To do this they "sought out a number of families and reconstructed their lives
                    from 1900 to 1975." The families chosen, although "not statistically
                    typical… comprised a rough cross-section of the population in 1900 and…
                    continue to reflect this relative balance while also evoking many of the changes that have occurred
                    since 1900" (pp. ix-x).</p>
            <p>This textbook should be especially interesting to Hoosiers because it includes two <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh County</region>
                    </placeName> families and provides some valuable insights into southwestern Indiana history. It also
                    illustrates the new social history approach— i.e., history from the "bottom
                    up." The authors declare that they will describe American history which was
                    "directly relevant to the lives of ‘our’ families," analyze
                    "the quality of life for these families," and place "their lifestyles in
                    the context of social and cultural trends" (pp. x–xi).</p>
            <p>Problems of methodology and conception, however, prevent the attainment of these goals. For example,
                    the criteria for selection and analysis of families are vague. Of the thirteen families cited, some
                    (the Japanese-American Kuriharas) are treated cursorily; others are in effect dropped after World
                    War II (the Irish-American O'Reillys); and still others (the Hispanic-American Navas and
                    Martinezes) appear only after World War II. The names of all the families cited, moreover, are
                    fictitious. This practice makes analysis of the evidence impossible. There are also no footnotes.</p>
            <p>In addition to the use of fictitious names, factual errors tend to cast doubt upon the reliability of
                    the evidence. For example, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Täglicher Demokrat</hi> was forced to close in April, 1918, not May, 1917;
                    its demise was in part the work of a German-American mayor (p. 128). <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s congressman after World War II was Winfield, not William, Denton (p. 435).
                    The impact of Bendix-Westinghouse upon <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s recovery in the 1960s was negligible (p. 486). Jimmy Carter does not have a
                    Ph.D. (p. 429), and local bicentennial <pb n="341" id="VAA4025-073-4-095"/> committees did not have
                    the luxury of being forced to look for ways to spend federal funds (p. 430).</p>
            <p>More serious are the conceptual limitations revealed by the assertion that these families were
                    selected "principally to illustrate and explain various themes of our study" and
                    that "countless other families would reveal as much…" (p. x). Instead
                    of including more "typical" families—e.g., southern Italians and potato
                    famine refugees from <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>—the authors chose descendants of a skilled worker from northern <placeName>
                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>
                    </placeName> and of an Irish immigrant of 1892. Why a German Catholic family which settled in
                    southwest Indiana was not selected is also questionable. The assumptions, or themes, moreover, are
                    dubious. For instance, is there something pernicious about the view that private property and home
                    ownership promote good citizenship (p. 73) ? Should Americans find the ideal of legal equality and
                    the existence of social inequality irreconcilable (pp. 103, 503) ? Had Americans learned by 1975
                    that "they were tied to one another by unbreakable bonds" (p. 503) ?</p>
            <p>The most obvious theme is that only one family "ever enjoyed real power. Though most had
                    entered the middle class by the 1950's, none had achieved complete economic security. They
                    were aware that they had little access to the centers of power…. But they accepted
                    passively the right and superior wisdom of a small, self-perpetuating elite…"
                    (pp. 502–503). More careful selection of families and more attention to the structure of
                    elites would have weakened this assertion considerably. For example, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s poor of 1900, the German Catholics, wielded substantial power by 1975. Both
                    candidates for mayor in 1971 and 1975, moreover, were Roman Catholic. Such a situation would have
                    been unthinkable in 1900. It is also doubtful that "complete economic security"
                    existed anywhere in the America of 1975.</p>
            <p>The new social history is essential, and family history is a useful teaching tool. The scholarship of
                    this textbook, however, leaves much to be desired. Whether it will interest students in history
                    remains to be seen.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Two Centuries of American Agriculture</hi> is the sixth in a series of anthologies
                    published by the Agricultural History <pb n="342" id="VAA4025-073-4-096"/> Society, all of which
                    appeared originally as journal numbers of <hi rend="i">Agricultural History</hi> and all except one
                    of which grew out of symposia sponsored by the society. Unlike earlier volumes, which are organized
                    around regional and period topics in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> agricultural history, the 1976 contribution focuses, predictably, on a bicentennial
                    theme. The book includes an introduction, nineteen articles, and several commentaries delivered by
                    critics at the symposium.</p>
            <p>On the whole the articles fall short of the quality of those in the earlier volumes. This is due
                    largely to the symposium's rather cumbersome bicentennial format. Most of the articles
                    attempt a two hundred year overview of such subjects as Indians, immigrants, and women in
                    agriculture; research and education; science and technology; agricultural credit and trade; and
                    rural politics. With few exceptions this ambitious but difficult undertaking results in poorly
                    supported generalizations or dreary recitations of well known facts. In either case the effort at
                    synthesis fails. The four pieces on women labor under an added burden. Although one might applaud
                    the symposium's symbolic support for feminism, these articles succeed only in demonstrating
                    the inadequacy of the women in agriculture theme as an organizational framework for scholarly
                    inquiry. In an apparent effort to stretch the bicentennial structure to include a public policy
                    dimension, two authors peer into the future and predict several far reaching changes in the
                    agricultural sector, but they provide little more than readers might reasonably be expected to
                    intuit on their own.</p>
            <p>Several of the articles rise above the rest. Theodore Saloutos' orderly review of immigrant
                    contributions to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> agriculture and Gilbert C. Fite's thoughtful essay on the pioneer farmer offer
                    fresh insights. Allan G. Bogue, in one of the volume's two successful attempts at
                    synthesis, assembles a mass of information and weaves it into a perceptive account of the history of
                    land credit in the northern states. In the other successful attempt at synthesis, Paul W. Gates
                    calls upon his vast knowledge and understanding of land policy to trace the acquisition and
                    disposition of the public domain over the two hundred years since the Revolution. The
                    volume's most provocative article, William N. Parker's comparative analysis of the
                    European industrial revolution and American agricultural development, proposes a three stage model
                    of technological change—artisan industry with <pb n="343" id="VAA4025-073-4-097"/> royal
                    or commercial stimulation, a burst of mechanical inventions, and the development of fundamental
                    science—to explain productivity growth. In addition to the useful information and
                    insights contained in these articles, Joseph D. Reid's commentary on the Bogue and Parker
                    pieces makes the interesting observation that what the field of agricultural history now needs is an
                    overarching theoretical framework. Reid offers the enticing suggestion that the American experience
                    may best be seen as varieties of profit maximizing behavior.</p>
            <p>In sum, despite the value of several of the articles, the results of the bicentennial symposium are
                    disappointing. Happily for those interested in the field, the Agricultural History Society has
                    returned to a regional/period format for subsequent symposia.</p>

                    published sources and on interviews with informants, including the granddaughter of Chief Simon
                    Pokagon, produced a very sympathetic story of two Indians attempting to respond peaceably to white

                    published in 1959. Although several articles and dissertations on the Region have appeared since
                    1959, Moore's book remains the standard printed reference to the diversity and significance
                    of Indiana's northwestern corner. Moore ended his account in 1933. For this reprint
                    edition, Lance Trusty has summarized major developments since that date. Trusty's
                    twenty-eight page afterword is a useful overview that should stimulate further research in the many
                    significant topics he surveys.</p>
