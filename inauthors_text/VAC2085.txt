				GEORGE LOCKERBIE
				In Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, George Murray Lockerbie was born in April, 1771.
				The little border town on Solway Frith, in Annandale, is in the southern part of the
					shire, which was the stronghold of the Stewarts and a hotbed of patriotism. Within a
					radius of a few miles is Elderslie, where the patriot Wallace first saw the light; east of
					Lochmaben is the castle which Annandale claims as the birthplace of Robert Bruce; and
					Thomas Carlyle, who was born at Ecclefechan, a village just out of Annan, describes the
					town of George Lockerbie's birth, during the first quarter of the last century, as "a
					fine, bright, self-confident little town;" of the people he writes that they were "an
					argumentative, clear-headed, contentious set of people, more given to intellectual
					pursuits than some of their neighbors." Nearby is the village of Lockerbie, and the story
					is told that in early days, when the laird of the castle fared forth to war, he would shut
					up his wife and other valued possessions for safe keeping during his absence. "Lock her
					by," he would order. This happened so often that when the custom of surnames became
					prevalent, this belligerent old Scot had earned the right to his of Lockerbie.
				A recognized characteristic of these Lockerbies is that they have the courage of their
					convictions and never lack the personal courage to express them. In the town of Lockerbie
					there still remains the memory of the great "Lockerbie lick," when these people in a
					battle defeated the Maxwells with great slaughter. From people like  these, from such surroundings, where the very air is the essence of
					patriotism, came George Lockerbie. At the beginning of the last century, he had become a
					writer of note; his political articles and those protesting against and exposing the
					outrages of the press gang, published in Glasgow and Edinburgh papers, led to his arrest
					and imprisonment. Inflammatory writings, calculated to incite Scottish subjects to
					rebellion, was one count in the indictment against him. His trial followed immediately
					upon his arrest, and he defended his own case and was acquitted. His friends had swarmed
					up from Dumfriesshire for the trial, and these with a great crowd of sympathizers
					surrounded him upon his release and bore him upon their shoulders through the streets of
					Edinburgh.
				This experience decided him to leave the country he loved so well and make a new home in
					America, where thought and speech and pen were free.
				He had married Ann Blacklocke some years before, and with his family came to America in
					1809; they lived near Philadelphia, in Germantown, until the close of the War of 1812,
					when they removed to Lexington, Kentucky.
				Mr. Lockerbie had been brought up a Presbyterian of the old Scotch type, but in Lexington
					he and his family became members of the Episcopal church and remained in that faith,
					identifying themselves with Christ Church in Indianapolis when that church was organized a
					few years after they came here to live.
				It was during his residence in Lexington that General Lafayette visited Kentucky. May 16,
					1825, was the date of his visit to Lexington. Mr. Lockerbie was an enthusiastic Mason, and
					on the occasion of General  Lafayette's attendance at a
					lodge meeting there, Mr. Lockerbie as presiding officer presented the distinguished
					visitor with his own apron to wear. This was of white kid, and many years after was
					presented by Mr. Lockerbie's daughter, Mrs. McOuat, to the Indiana State Museum, where it
					is still preserved as a relic of historic value.
				In Lexington, Mr. Lockerbie had a cotton-gin and a large number of slaves. He was a
					staunch Democrat, but liberty-loving soul could not bear the idea of slavery. He freed
					these slaves, and in 1830, still in search of freedom, came to Indianapolis with his
					family and son-in-law, Thomas McOuat, who had married Janet Lockerbie in Lexington.
				Shortly after taking up his residence in Indianapolis he became actively identified with
					the official life of this permanent home. He was assessor in the year 1835. He was town
					trustee from the first ward during the years 1836 and 1837, and councilman and president
					of the council from the same ward in 1838 and 1839. During the building of the canal,
					about 1836 and 1837, the town was filled with a very unruly element, and Mr. Lockerbie was
					a leader in the law and order movement which became a necessity.
				He was prominent in Masonry here, as in Lexington, and in 1835 was elected junior warden
					of Center Lodge.
				His home was at the northeast corner of Alabama and Market streets, a small cottage, two
					rooms of which faced upon Alabama street; one of these was Mr. Lockerbie's office, and, as
					was usual in those early days, was simply furnished with table and a few chairs. The floor
					was sanded, and everything about the house and trim little 
					garden at the back spoke eloquently of the care of the good Scotch housewife within. Mrs.
					Lockerbie's miniature shows that she adhered to the customs and dress of her native
					country and wore a blue kirtle, a kerchief around her shoulders, crossed and tied at the
					back, with a mob cap framing a sweet, merry old face.
				Here in this cottage home these two, who were favorites wherever they were, received
					their many friends and acquaintances of all ages. The young children were in and out of
					the place continually—the little ones climbing upon Mr. Lockerbie's knee, where he
					trotted them while he sang to them quaint Scotch folk songs or recited verse after verse
					of his favorite Burns. To the older children he was a mine of information and an
					encyclopedia; some of these children came to him with their lessons as regularly as they
					went to school. The older people came to him, and he numbered a great many young men among
					those who delighted to visit him—young men like Lew Wallace and John
					Coburn—and very interesting were the arguments and debates that went on under his
					roof. On a fly-leaf of the old book containing the Assessment Record—a reproduction
					of which follows this sketch—is a memorandum referring to an article in the Democratic Review of 1844 on the "conduct and character of three men of
					the time of the French Revolution." Of this article he writes, "It defends Robespierre and
					Marat, and justly as I believe, from the misrepresentations of the enemies of Freedom and
					of the just rights of mankind." He was a socialist in the ideal sense of the
					word—never swerving from the furtherance of the cause of freedom nor from the
					defence of the rights of man.
				
				The fly-leaves of this old assessors' record are filled with memoranda—items of
					farm, family and general interest. Here are some of them: 
						"General Zachary Taylor—Newport Kentucky—the Hero!!!"
						"June 8, 1846 Wrote this day—for the first time to my nephew Andrew Thomson,
							Cleveland, Ohio."
						"Monday 21 Sept., 1846. This day Andrew (McOuat) entered on his apprenticeship for
							the term of four years to C. and J. Cox to learn the trade of a tin-plate
							worker."
						"September 3d 1846. Mrs. Elizabeth Gentle died this morning at half-past four
							o'clock. Buried at 4 o'clock p. m. same day, in the same lot and the same graveyard
							with her brother Thomas McOuat."
						"Mr. William McOuat died Sep 11, 1841, aged 67 years."
						"Mrs. Margaret McOuat wife of William McOuat died January 3d 1853 supposed to be
							90 years of age."
						"December 28th 1846. Martha went to Mrs. Richmonds school.
						"January 11th 1847. Jean went to Mrs. Richmonds school."
					
				The last of these family records is: "Feb. 22, 1853. This day
							Miss Jane Gentle became Mrs. Morris Howland by marriage."
				On the blank leaves following the assessment record is a daily weather report for eight
					years—from January 1, 1845, to January 3, 1853. It is headed, "Remarks on the
					weather," and is kept as follows: 
						"Jan. 15. 1845. Cloudy and mild. Thunder and lightning and rain at 3 p. m. Evening
							cloudy and mizzling."
						"June 7th 1845. Fair and dry. Afternoon fair and 
							warm. Evening clear and warm. Great drought. Wind S."
					
				This record is thus carefully kept until the last page of the book is reached. Doubtless
					it was continued in the same methodical way in another volume during his remaining years,
					but has not been preserved. This is perhaps the earliest known weather report of
					Indianapolis now in existence.
				In the assessment list Mr. Lockerbie has given more information than the law required him
					to furnish. The law calls for "a full assessment roll of persons, lands, town lots and
					chattels, taxable in his district." Mr. Lockerbie gives a full census, instead of merely a
					list of persons subject to poll-tax. His notes as to the occupancy of the several pieces
					of real estate furnish quite a complete directory of Indianapolis at the time.
				After the death of his wife, Mr. Lockerbie lived with his daughter, Mrs. McOuat, until
					his death, June 18, 1856. Mrs. McOuat's home was near the corner of East and New York
					streets. In platting this property as an addition to Indianapolis she named the street
					north of New York street—from East to Noble streets—Lockerbie in honor of her
					father. James Whitcomb Riley, who lives in this street, has immortalized it in his
					beautiful little poem, "Lockerbie Street"—a fitting tribute to that which bears the
					name of a man whose life was practical prose, but whose heart and soul were full of
					poetry.
