            <p>Historical treatments of the Confederate invasions of Indiana in 1863 have portrayed the raids as
                    aberrations that had little or no enduring impact aside from producing a slightly better organized
                    militia and a wealth of folklore. What such interpretations have failed to investigate is how and
                    why the unity that was produced by the military threat to the state was so quickly dissolved after
                    the danger had passed. Indeed, historians generally agree that the unity was short lived, but none
                    have analyzed why this was the case. A closer examination of the guerrilla raids of General John
                    Hunt Morgan and Captain Thomas H. Hines reveals that the causes of this rapid disintegration of
                    solidarity among Hoosiers may be found both in the divisive party issues of the day and in the
                    unique circumstances created by the raids themselves. Because of the unified response they
                    engendered, these events had the potential to reduce or even eliminate the partisan accusations of
                    widespread disloyalty in the state. Instead, both Republicans and Democrats chose to ignore the
                    possible political implications of the raids and to perpetuate the extreme political hyperbole that
                    had existed previously.</p>
            <p>The physical and psychological stress of civil war, the intense divisions between supporters and
                    opponents of the conflict, and the social and economic changes at home caused many members of both
                    political parties in the Hoosier state to become, at times, over-zealous. Believing that peace could
                    be brought about only through armed conflict, Republican leaders denounced as disloyal virtually
                    everyone who did not support all aspects of the war. By equating dissent with treason they created
                    among their constituents an unfounded fear of their Democratic neighbors. The

                    charges of disloyalty. Republicans had at their disposal the means to suppress treason wherever they
                    found it, and they used this power to their political advantage. In support of their accusations of
                    treason they discovered numerous disloyal activities that they attributed to members of the
                    Democratic party, including a plot to kill Republican Governor Oliver P. Morton, evidence of
                    cooperation with <placeName>

                    organization that allegedly existed in the Midwest during the war.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In part, Democrats themselves brought on Republican charges and criticism. By the fall of 1862 in
                    Indiana, as elsewhere in the North, the Democracy had become predominantly an opposition party. As
                    Republicans put forth increasingly radical policies with regard to enlarging governmental powers,
                    Democrats became ever more vigilant in their defense of antebellum conservatism. In desperate
                    attempts to regain their dominance in Indiana politics, Democratic editors and politicians appealed
                    to the emotional issues of racism and attempted to rekindle old fears of sectional domination by New <placeName>

                    </placeName> on issues such as the tariff, internal improvements, and banking legislation. Their
                    constant objections to Republican initiatives garnered them a reputation among many as a purely
                    negative party.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because Democrats had dominated the political scene in Indiana from 1843 until at least 1854,
                    Republicans did not find it easy to discredit them. By late 1862 the implementation of the draft and
                    Lincoln's announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation, along with disheartening news from
                    the war front, allowed the Democrats <list type="footnotes">

                    legislature near the end of the session of 1863, ostensibly in an attempt to prevent Democrats from
                    passing bills that would severely curtail the powers of Governor Morton and hinder his support of
                    the war effort. The Republicans’ refusal to return for the remainder of the session
                    brought the General Assembly to a standstill. The offensive Democratic legislation was not passed,
                    but neither were any appropriation bills, leaving the Republican administration with no funds to run
                    the state government. Jubilant Democrats looked forward to a special session, but, through the
                    acquisition of financial aid from outside sources and the legally dubious but careful management of
                    this money by the governor himself, the state remained solvent until the next regularly scheduled
                    session of the General Assembly in January, 1865.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As early as January, 1863, one Republican leader in Indiana noted, "Our reverses have been

                        discouraged."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> As the year progressed, continued military setbacks,
                    the emergence of a strong Democratic peace movement, and periodic violent resistance to the draft
                    led some Republicans to fear an uprising against the government at home.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> By
                    June, 1863, Union morale had reached its nadir.</p>
            <p>Such was the state of Indiana politics when the dashing young Confederate Captain Thomas H. Hines

                    "scout north of the Cumberland river" to obtain recruits and fresh mounts. Finding
                    himself the target of Federal troops in <placeName>

                    poorly organized and undrilled Home Guard units rushed to apprehend his party. On June 19, after

                    militia, a group of citizens trapped Hines's troops on an island. The captain and a few of

            <p>Perhaps the Hines raid should have assured doubtful Republicans that their Democratic neighbors,
                    though they might be averse to the aims and conduct of the war, were nonetheless fully prepared to
                    defend their homes and had no intention of aiding a rebel invasion. Yet, despite the suspension of
                    most partisan bickering during the raid itself, the habits of party politics were hard to break.
                    While some Democrats joined those Republicans who praised the nonpartisan response to the threat,

            <p>Though Indiana Governor Morton, like Burnside and Boyle, could not be sure of Morgan's
                    objectives, he was much more concerned about a possible invasion of his state. He had cause to be
                    worried. One of the few who had realized after the Hines raid that the state was poorly prepared to
                    defend itself, Morton had requested twenty-five thousand arms and twelve pieces of artillery from <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Morton had also called out the Indiana Legion, as the state militia forces were known,
                    and sent Adjutant General Lazarus Noble to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> with "full power" over that body in hopes of stopping Morgan before

                    convinced Morton that the threat of invasion was not serious, and he halted the mobilization of the
                    Legion until further notice.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While Federal authorities frantically attempted to discern Morgan's position and intentions,
                    the people of Indiana remained largely unaware that a threat existed. The first public reports that
                    Morgan had even entered <placeName>

                    next day or later.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> The lack of information concerning Morgan's
                    advance was due to both poor communications and the widespread assumption that Morgan's aim

                    the Confederate general had already captured two steamboats and crossed his entire force into
                    Indiana before reports of his whereabouts reached them. Even when these reports were received,
                    Burnside doubted their veracity, still believing <placeName>

                    entered the state, the people were caught off guard, and pandemonium ensued. As Morgan's

                    few preparations had been made for the defense of the border since the Hines raid, and the hasty
                    attempt to organize companies around the state proved to be chaotic as few of the men had any
                    military experience and those that did often bickered over who should be in charge.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Some areas failed to organize in time because the people still doubted that the raid was in

                    however, was the lack of arms and ammunition. A great number of companies had none at all. In other
                    cases arms were either such obscure makes or so out of date that the proper ammunition was no longer
                    produced. Not only were arms and ammunition not in the hands of the defenders of the state but there
                    were few available to ship to them, so while Morton was busy obtaining a shipment of muskets from <placeName>

                    that Morgan should stand and fight to a complete misunderstanding of the guerrilla tactics that he
                    employed along his route. To the people of southern Indiana who had not been introduced to the
                    firsthand realities of war, Morgan's system of replenishing his mounts through the
                    impressment of horses from ordinary citizens was seen as an unmitigated act of theft, and
                    Morgan's name was seldom mentioned without colorful adjectives attached to it such as
                    "King of the American Freebooters" or, more commonly, simply "horse

                    canaries in it" despite the fact that items of this sort were cumbersome and useless.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Yet on the whole the value of the items taken by the Confederates was slight.

                    did not stand and fight that the Home Guards remained confident of their martial abilities. Even at
                    Corydon, where the Indiana militia had quickly surrendered, Hoosiers ignored the outcome and
                    believed that they had been victorious because they had inflicted more casualties than they had

                    possibly gain control of the entire state. Such apprehensions were perhaps unrealistic; but as

                    Confederates to simply slowing them down so Federal forces could catch them or driving them from the
                    state to keep the damage they wrought to a minimum.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> In addition to the poor
                    preparation made to combat the raid and the lack of arms and ammunition available to deal with it,
                    Indiana had only infantry to meet and check Morgan's cavalry. Indeed, the state
                    "had not more than two hundred" mounted troops available to meet Morgan's
                        veterans.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> The dependence on infantry meant that a rapid deployment of
                    large numbers of troops to any specific point required the use of the railroads, which, of course,
                    had been effectively disabled by Morgan to prevent this action.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>

            <p>Of the few realistic opportunities that the Indiana forces had to intercept Morgan, most were lost
                    because of poor or inexperienced leadership. Perhaps the best chance of obstructing
                    Morgan's progress, however, failed apparently because of sheer negligence. This opportunity
                    occurred on July 13 as Morgan was nearing the <placeName>

                            also justified his absence on the night of July 13, in passing, "On the morning of

                    Confederate government. The Democracy insisted that "upon this slanderous
                    abolition-republican party must rest, the entire odium and responsibility of Morgan's

                    responsibility for the raid to the opposing party, editors and politicians took little notice of the

                    can be accepted as legitimate.</p>
            <p>In all probability neither party had coaxed Morgan into Indiana nor was solely responsible for the
                    lack of preparation for defense. With regard to the contention that Morgan was invited into the
                    state by either party's press or that the Confederate general intended to create a
                    Copperhead uprising, little substantial evidence exists. All indications suggest that his actions
                    were independently conceived. Despite the orders of his superiors, which granted him permission to

            <p>While partisan rhetoric was not the catalyst for Morgan's raid, neither was the poor
                    preparation for defense against border raids entirely the fault of one party or the other. Instead,
                    it was the result of several factors that were beyond the immediate control of either party. Perhaps
                    the greatest detriment to the formation of an organized and reliable force was the fact that prior
                    to the outbreak of war in 1861 there had not been an organized militia in the state for thirty
                    years. Since the laws that remained were often fragmentary and had been developed for other types of
                    threats, it was necessary for legislators ignorant of militia techniques themselves to develop new
                    laws for the defense of the state.<hi rend="sup">77</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In formulating a new militia law the legislators were bound by their constituents’
                    conservative inclinations toward military service. The "<hi rend="i">coercive
                    principle</hi>," which to be effective would have required the sacrifice of personal

                    Voluntarism was thus accepted as the foundation of the 1861 Indiana Militia Law under which the
                    Indiana Legion was organized.<hi rend="sup">79</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Compounding the inherent problems of reliance on voluntary service, the Militia Law required no
                    enrollment and provided no inducement to volunteer. Except for those expenses incurred while
                    employed under a call of the governor for active service, all costs associated with the arming,
                    clothing, organizing, and drilling of companies of the Legion had to be borne by the individuals who
                    volunteered for them. When combined with the loss of time in the fields or at a business, these
                    expenses made even the most patriotic men somewhat apathetic toward militia service. It is not
                    surprising, therefore, that the organization and mobilization of Legion companies generally occurred
                    only in the counties along the southern border of the state where the threat of raids existed, and
                    even there the organization of those forces was difficult to maintain without the existence of a
                    direct military threat. Except for the Morgan raid, in fact, most of the central and northern parts
                    of the state seldom organized companies of the Legion.<hi rend="sup">80</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While political leaders should not be dealt with too harshly for not creating a perfect militia
                    system initially, they can be held accountable for failing to alter that system when its weaknesses
                    were discovered. Unfortunately, the bills that were ostensibly devised to correct the problems
                    usually had no chance of passing into law either because they lacked constituent support or because
                    they were extremely partisan in nature. One such partisan bill was proposed by the Democrats in the
                    truncated legislative session of 1863. Its main objective was to modify the Legion in such a way as
                    to reduce the governor's influence over military patronage and his control over the Legion
                    by forcing him to share some of those powers with the leading Democratic officials in the state
                        government.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>

            <p>Democrats, of course, tried to blame the Republican party for the state's lack of military
                    preparation. It was, however, more the result of a flawed Militia Law and both parties’
                    obstructions to the attempts to improve it that the state forces remained largely unorganized and
                    poorly drilled at the time of the Confederate raids. After the Hines raid, in fact, the Republican

                    efforts came too late and were not generally supported as the majority of the population was
                    seemingly unconcerned about the possibility of a raid. Since the war had already been raging for
                    over two years by the summer of 1863 and the existing forces had successfully repulsed the Hines
                    invasion, most Hoosiers saw no need to take time away from harvesting their crops to organize.

                    </placeName> early in the raid, the state had been much better protected. Thus, despite Democratic
                    allegations, the lack of preparation by the militia was due more to the adherence to the
                    conservative principles that the Democratic party itself was defending than the negligence of
                    Republican leaders.</p>
            <p>With the Confederate incursions into southern Indiana in the summer of 1863, the seemingly impossible
                    had become reality. Until faced with a real threat to their personal safety, politicians at home had
                    been able to exaggerate the positions of their opponents in attempts to exploit popular fears and
                    gain support for their own party. When legitimate threats did appear in the form of the invasions of
                    Hines and Morgan, such political hyperbole was rendered obsolete. To a public that feared for its
                    own physical safety, everyone's help was needed irrespective of political affiliations.
                    Driven by these same fears and caught up in the excitement of the moment, the politicians and
                    editors of both parties initially praised the nonpartisan response to the raids.</p>
            <p>As Morgan left the state and the panic subsided, both Democrats and Republicans found the political
                    situation in Indiana altered. In light of the overwhelming patriotic response displayed throughout
                    the state, Republican charges of disloyalty no longer appeared valid. Democrats, however, did not
                    attempt to exploit this fact. Since politically they could not take any credit for having been loyal
                    to a Republican administration or having made a patriotic response to a war they did not support,
                    they criticized the leadership that the Republicans had exhibited during the raid. Instead Democrats
                    claimed that their enthusiasm had not been a patriotic response at all but a reaction necessary for
                    self-defense. The fact that they had defended their homes and families against a group of guerrilla
                    "horse thieves" indicated simply that they had upheld the law; it did not by any
                    means represent support of the Republican administration or a rejection of the Democratic antiwar
                    platform. Such criticism not only allowed the Democrats to maintain their status as an opposition
                    party but also served to draw attention away from the fact that Indiana's poor performance
                    against Morgan had been due, in part, to Democratic conservative ideals toward military service.</p>
            <p>The Democrats’ quick return to negative politics left their members open to the old
                    allegations of disloyalty, and the Republicans <pb n="25" id="VAA4025-088-1-031"/> seized the
                    opportunity to perpetuate them. The fact that the response to the raid had not led to a successful
                    conclusion had left the Republicans open to criticism: in the absence of the Indiana General
                    Assembly Morton virtually ran the state government by himself and stood to be blamed for the
                    militia's failure to capture Morgan. Thus once again Republicans jumped at the chance to
                    equate the Democratic position with treason and even elaborated upon their previous allegations.</p>
            <p>In the end both political parties were more than happy to let the actual circumstances of the raids
                    be forgotten. Recognition of the enthusiasm that had been exhibited in the defense of the state
                    replaced the memory of the botched response to the military invasion. In turn, Hoosiers who were
                    self-conscious about their own performance eagerly accepted such praise. Soon political hyperbole
                    reverted to its preraid state and allowed all involved to ignore the troubling questions that had
                    been raised by the invasions. A return to the politics of war proved far easier to debate in the
                    absence of a direct military threat.</p>

            <p>On January 3, 1918, members of the Board of Trustees of Indiana State Normal School gathered at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> for their monthly meeting. Uppermost on their agenda that cold day was the case of Dr.
                    John J. Schlicher, a professor of Latin who had become a magnet for controversy. The previous spring
                    Schlicher had delivered a chapel talk that had provoked much comment. Although a colleague later
                    characterized the address as a "mild and thoughtful warning" induced by concern
                    "lest super-heated American citizens…use undemocratic methods at home"
                    in the pursuit of war aims,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> a number of critics had questioned the

                    faced another crisis in January, 1918, this time precipitated by the professor's alteration
                    of a patriotic organization's membership card. As a result of this second controversy the
                    board voted not to renew his contract.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to the trustees the dismissal implied no disloyalty on Schlicher's part; rather,
                    it resulted from his unwise actions, which had shown Indiana State Normal in an unflattering light.
                    The Latin professor, the trustees said, had "by his utterances and behavior"
                    seriously impaired "his value to the school"; thus, he was to leave the faculty
                    "as early as practicable" and no later than June 30, 1918.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    colleagues and the narrow bigotry of would be patriotic societies." Whatever the real
                    reasons, the professor's twenty-two-year association with Normal came to a clouded end.
                    Ironically, the board meeting took place on the same day that Schlicher had been recommended to the
                    War Department "to help in a work of benefit to the boys in camp."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Indiana State Normal Board of Trustees reached its decision concerning Schlicher in a highly
                    charged wartime atmosphere that sometimes veered into hysteria. Prior to America's official
                    entry into the conflict, the Great War had not been an omnipresent entity for most citizens of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Although news reports and propaganda from both sides found their way into
                    American—and Hoosier—living rooms, distance and apathy lessened their impact.
                    As the war in Europe progressed, however, more and more Americans began to take notice; quietly, and
                    sometimes not so quietly, they began to take sides.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Early sentiment in Indiana was somewhat divided. Of the half-million Hoosiers who were foreign-born,
                    or who had at least one foreign-born parent, 50 percent could be identified as German, and many of
                    them still had close ties to their homeland. Nevertheless, as the war continued, most citizens of
                    Indiana—up to 75 percent, in fact—aligned themselves with the Allied Powers,
                    which were seen as exemplifying the democratic traditions so important to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Even many "Germans" expressed an antipathy toward the
                    "autocrats" of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>

                    of the country, quickly closed ranks behind the government. All areas of society mobilized for the
                    war effort, public opinion included. Patriotic sentiment intensified, and statements of what did or
                    did not constitute loyalty abounded. Theodore Roosevelt characterized as "moral traitors

                    as well as any actions meant to disrupt industry. Watchdog groups such as the Indiana Patriotic

            <p>Obvious targets for the patriotic organizations were individuals who had even a hint of German

                    Even those with distinguished records, such as John J. Schlicher, had to be circumspect if they

            <p>Schlicher had arrived at Indiana State Normal in 1896. Born in Merton, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, in 1869, he had studied under German-trained scholars at an academy sponsored by the
                    Evangelical and Reformed church. In 1888 he had entered the classical course at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> and had attained his A.B. degree four years later. Upon graduation he had taught Latin
                    at Mt. Morris College in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> for two years. From 1894 to 1896 he had done graduate work at the University of <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Indiana State Normal had opened in 1870 to train young men and women to teach in the common schools
                    of Indiana. Like other such normal schools, it was considered by some to be little more than a
                    vocational training center undeserving of the respect accorded a regular college or university. It
                    did not acquire the patina of the more illustrious academic institutions that featured education in
                    the classics; thus, it did not always attract "the best and brightest" in faculty
                    or students. Schlicher, in fact, joined a staff composed mainly of Normal graduates or alumni of
                    similar institutions. He was one of the few university-educated members of the faculty. Dr. Charles
                    Redway Dryer, one of Schlicher's contemporaries who had studied at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName>, found "very few college bred men" at Indiana State Normal. He noted,
                    however, that his colleagues were congenial and that several "had extraordinary native
                    abilities suffering from abortive educations." One of those thus described was William Wood
                    Parsons, a highly esteemed graduate of Indiana State Normal, its president from 1885 to 1921, and
                    later an antagonist in the Schlicher story.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Schlicher, then, in terms of his

            <p>After teaching at Normal for three years, Schlicher was granted a leave of absence in 1899 to pursue
                    a doctorate. He traveled to Europe, spending a year at the prestigious universities of
                    Göttingen and Berlin, where he researched his thesis on the origin of rhythmic verse in

                    deeply influenced by their European experiences," which fostered an admiration for the

                    interested in European affairs, one who was both curious and well informed about activities and
                    personalities abroad. Among other things he followed closely the "Russo-German peace
                    business" and kept up with European writers, reading such diverse fare as British Socialist
                    Henry Mayers Hyndman's autobiography and the gloomy work of Mikhail Artzybashev.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

                    </placeName> in 1850 to Latin verse. He also tried his hand, less successfully, at writing
                        fiction.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Despite his failure as a short story writer, Schlicher by the
                    beginning of 1917 had gained the respect of his colleagues for his scholarship, teaching ability,
                    and integrity. In a later assessment one professor remarked that Schlicher was "free from
                    prejudice to an uncommon degree" and "was inherently a believer in the democratic
                    way of living." Still another, when appraising the work of Indiana State Normal, felt that
                    Schlicher was among those few who could "float a faculty."<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
                    By the close of 1917, however, the Latin professor's contemporaries no longer held such
                    universally high opinions. Ironically, his belief in, and espousal of, his democratic ideals aided
                    in his undoing.</p>

                    the first week of June, 1917. His comments soon enveloped him in a swirl of controversy. No precise

                    protested the discourse admitted that they could not reproduce it from memory.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
                    Approximately one week later, in response to the uproar that his words had sparked, Schlicher
                    re-created some of his speech for publication. In this re-creation he expressed profound admiration
                    for President Woodrow Wilson's war message and avowed his support for the ideals espoused
                    in the president's speech. He adjured his audience to allow people their differences and
                    not to assume that being different was the same thing as being wrong. As long as people were in
                    sympathy with the aims of the country and the president, he believed, they should be allowed their
                    own point of view. People should not be censured just because they did not look at everything from
                    the same angle or display their sentiment in the same way. The object of his speech, he said, was to
                    promote "the value of clear and careful thinking."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>A number of faculty members and students who had attended the assembly interpreted the Latin
                    professor's remarks quite differently. They viewed the speech as "non-committal
                    and querulous" at best, "distinctly pro-German" in its darkest context;
                    perhaps it was even an act of betrayal against America. The campus was soon abuzz with talk of
                    Schlicher and his supposed views, and the controversy quickly spread into the <placeName>

                    speech. It also took Schlicher, and by extension other educators, to task for being less than
                    wholeheartedly loyal. The controversy at Indiana State Normal followed closely another incident
                    involving a local educator. In April the <placeName>

                    Parsons, who had been associated with Normal from the time it had first opened its doors, was
                    particularly concerned about the negative publicity directed at his school. The president had been a
                    member of Normal's first class and had served the school for all but four years of his
                    adult life. By 1917 he was in his thirty-second year as its president, and during that time he had
                    presided over its growth in numbers and prestige. Parsons himself had become a force in both

            <p>Writing over a year after the 1917 incident, and after Schlicher's dismissal in 1918,
                    Parsons reflected that the Latin professor's speech was notable "not so much for
                    what it contained, but on account of the absence of any pronounced, clear cut stand favorable to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>." "Certainly," he wrote in 1918 in response to a <placeName>

                    not have offended any person having the strongest sympathy with the German cauue."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Parsons admitted that he had heard no pro-German opinions from Schlicher
                    prior to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>'s entrance into the war. The Latin professor was, he wrote, highly regarded
                    and viewed as a "level-headed conservative, sound thinker on all educational
                    topics." The president did comment that others had brought him vague reports that
                    Schlicher's sympathies might lie with <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, but he failed to elaborate on the accusation.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Parsons's
                    words may well have been colored by the 1918 controversy and a need to justify Schlicher's
                    dismissal, but they are also indicative of his feelings on the chapel controversy.</p>
            <p>In his 1918 recollections of the earlier incident, Parsons outlined the procedures that he had taken
                    to prevent the situation in 1917 from getting further out of hand. He had, he reported, telephoned
                    Schlicher on the weekend following the address and told the professor of the concern of the faculty,
                    school, and public about the "tone of his speech." Already, he said he explained
                    to Schlicher, government security men were investigating the situation. Parsons <list type="footnotes">

                    Schlicher declined, saying that the speech was misunderstood because certain people "did

            <p>On Monday, June 11, the president rose in chapel to make clear the stance of Indiana State Normal on
                    the war. Before the faculty, students, members of the Indiana State Department of Public
                    Instruction, and reporters, he declared that the school was wholly in support of the government and
                    its aims. Such avowals, he said, would be reiterated every day in chapel if that was what it took to
                    make it fully understood. The speech—made, Parsons later admitted, "when his

                    other faculty members had made statements that called into question the strength of their

            </p>
            <p>After first refusing comment, Schlicher issued a statement on Wednesday, June 13. He averred that his
                    remarks had been misunderstood and affirmed his allegiance to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. In an effort to show the absurdity of the pro-German charges, he told the story of his
                    parents’ migration to America to escape the oppressive German government, claiming that
                    it would be illogical to assume that he would then support that same regime.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
                    Schlicher's words may have eased some doubts, but, by then, the affair had elicited so much
                    comment that Normal's Board of Trustees felt that they must investigate the situation.</p>
            <p>Board members prepared a list of questions for Schlicher. They asked if he had been born in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and if it held his first loyalty, if he would support the government even to the extent
                    of teaching patriotism in his classroom, and if he would fight for it if called upon. The besieged
                    professor answered the questions to the board's "entire satisfaction";
                    his contract was renewed for the forthcoming school year; and his name was listed alongside those of
                    other faculty members reelected to their positions.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> The board's
                    action closed a tumultuous week, but at best it had only dampened the fires, not extinguished them.</p>
            <p>Although the Indiana State Normal trustees had allowed Schlicher to retain his job, their decision
                    should not be viewed as approval of his actions. In effect, what they seemed to say was that he had
                    not stepped so far over the line as to warrant his dismissal. They voiced no ringing declarations
                    about academic freedom or integrity, <list type="footnotes">

                    remarks and beliefs, Parsons and the board could have used the occasion as an example of American
                    ideals at work—even in wartime. Further, they could have "thrown up the
                    barricades" in protection of academic freedom, an issue that was nowhere publicly
                    discussed.</p>
            <p>The board's apparent lack of regard for what should have been a prime consideration for the
                    school is not surprising. Academic freedom in America, "a precarious ideal in the best of
                    times," was in an extremely untenable position once the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> entered the war in 1917. The years of the Great War brought "continuous
                    assaults on professors by hostile outsiders." Many Americans, in part because of
                    traditional anti-intellectualism and distrust of those in "ivory towers," viewed
                    the realm of higher education as a particularly fertile area for "disloyalty."
                    Considerable numbers saw the campus as far more likely than the barnyard or town square to nitpick
                    or find fault with the war effort. Theirs was a not altogether unrealistic assumption. Many
                    educators had reservations about the war, its assumed causes, and its conduct. From <placeName>

                    Nevertheless, he was called before the university's Board of Regents to answer questions.

                    also played a role in Schlicher's case.</p>
            <p>Schlicher was not the only Hoosier professor to find himself at odds with his school. At Indiana
                    University in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, William E. Zeuch, a young instructor in the Economics Department, faced similar
                    difficulties in the fall of 1917. Zeuch wrote a letter to a newspaper in his home state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> to protest the virulence of what he saw as its anti-German propaganda. Like Schlicher,
                    his avowed purpose was to remind people that all Germans should not be seen as inhumane because they
                    lived under an autocratic regime that had taken them to war. He also wanted Americans to remember
                    that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> had been accused of atrocities in past conflicts. When word of his letter reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the resultant outcry led to his resignation. In words strikingly similar to those that
                    Indiana State Normal's board would use in 1918, a university committee found that Zeuch
                    could "no longer be useful to the university," and he stepped down under the
                        pressure.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As with other cases, including Schlicher's, the community's disapproval played a
                    role in Zeuch's downfall, but the place of the "professoriate itself" in
                    "wartime violations of freedom" was central. With the advent of war in 1917 public
                    opinion closed tightly behind the government, and those few who deviated from the accepted position,
                    however mildly, were the objects of intense focus. Even on college campuses, the supposed bastions
                    of truth seekers, the majority brooked little deviation from the official views. Hofstadter saw this
                    closing of the ranks as the development of a "cult of loyalty," while historian
                    Howard K. Beale found that educators who should have been "standing for reason and critical
                    thinking" actually fueled the hysteria. Even organizations that should actively have tried
                    to ensure academic freedom tended to cave in on such matters.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> The American

            <p>While Schlicher was away, the war effort throughout Indiana and at Normal proceeded apace; and as
                    American participation in the war intensified, so did patriotic sentiment. Indiana businessman and

                    remaining on campus drilled on their own or under the leadership of teachers until regular army

            <p>Under such circumstances Schlicher might well have been wise to monitor his statements carefully upon

                    Indiana State Council of Defense of professors who might be of service did not include his name.
                    That the Latin professor kept his views entirely to himself, however, is unlikely. His diaries
                    reveal that he held strong opinions about the press's portrayal of the war. He distrusted

                    the professor's outspokenness aggravated the situation when two new incidents cast further
                    suspicion his way.</p>
            <p>The first incident involved Schlicher's wife, Ella, who was a member of the Church of the
                    Brethren, a sect that often practiced pacifism and conscientious objection. Many persons thought
                    such terms euphemisms for cowardice and disloyalty and looked upon believers as patriotically
                    suspect. By all accounts Ella Schlicher was a devout woman who was known to affirm her beliefs
                    publicly. So heartfelt were her convictions that she "nearly lost her mind" when
                    her son Rudolph later joined the army. It was not surprising that her views, in combination with the
                    earlier controversy surrounding her husband, set tongues wagging in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Rumors spread that she had written to Rudolph in college to tell him to
                    "remember he was a German and that he had replied he would." As Schlicher later
                    pointed out, the rumormongers did not take into account the fact that his wife had been born in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to a Dutch family so long in the country that it did not know when the first ancestor
                    had arrived in America. Neither, he said, did the public consider that the statements purportedly in
                    the letter to Rudolph would have had to be reported by someone who had "the privilege of
                    opening the mails."<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Truth and logic nothwithstanding, some in the
                    community and at the college were obviously willing to believe anything derogatory about Schlicher
                    or his family.</p>
            <p>Another incident, which occurred near the end of 1917, effectively sealed Schlicher's fate
                    at Indiana State Normal. Again, the professor was something of an accomplice in his own undoing.
                    This time, ironically, his trouble sprang from his attempt to show his support of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and the war effort by joining the Indiana Patriotic League.</p>

                    </placeName> in August, 1917, by diplomat and politician Henry Lane Wilson, the league, according to
                    one historian, "had little significance" outside Wilson's
                    "desire to remain politically active."<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Like other such
                    groups that mushroomed during the war, the Indiana Patriotic League took on the roles of cheerleader
                    and watchdog. Its stated purpose was "to encourage and stimulate an intelligent support of
                    this government now engaged in war."<hi rend="sup">51</hi> The league's power, as
                    was the case with similar groups, tended to depend on who was involved and how seriously they were

                    influence, and one of the men who spoke to the membership was William Wood Parsons.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> In an effort to enlarge its roster, the league issued cards that presented information
                    about the group and its purposes. Prospective members were to read the printed statements, sign the
                    cards, and return them to the organization.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>

                    </placeName> chapter of the league, Schlicher obtained one of the membership cards in late 1917. The
                    form contained a statement that suggested the league should help "to provide methods for
                    striking at open and masked disloyalty." Schlicher changed the phrase to read "to
                    provide methods for putting down disloyalty." Historian and colleague William O. Lynch
                    later concluded that the change was meant to protect the innocent who might be harmed by those
                    suspecting them of ambiguous "masked disloyalty." Schlicher himself said the
                    alteration was a spur of the moment decision made "without as much reflection as he might
                    have given it." He feared, he wrote, that the expression might be used by some to persecute
                    those who had fallen under "persistent misunderstanding and unwarranted
                    suspicion," an experience with which he was all too familiar.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> Once
                    more his idealism and forthrightness, and a seeming lack of common sense, had brought conflict.
                    Instead of protecting the innocent he had succeeded only in exacerbating his own situation. This
                    time the consequences were fatal to his career at Normal.</p>
            <p>Presumably because of the altered statement on his membership request, the <placeName>

                    rejection to Normal's Board of Trustees. The old charges against the professor resurfaced
                    and were added to the new one. The league and others called for Schlicher's dismissal.
                    Apparently seeing no alternative, the exasperated Board of Trustees washed its hands of the
                    troublesome professor of Latin without giving him a hearing. President Parsons was ordered to notify
                    Schlicher of the boards decision at his discretion.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> It was to be two months

            <p>In the intervening months Schlicher went about his business unaware that any decision had been made.
                    He taught his classes, fretting when they did not go well.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> And, in one of the
                    most ironic twists of his story, he became one of the Four Minute Men, speakers who went to movie
                    theaters and other gatherings to explain the war and exhort support of its prosecution. Again, he
                    fretted when he thought he had not done well.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> He also contributed "as
                    liberally to various funds…[as] circumstances permitted."<hi rend="sup">59</hi>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> War Department appointed him a member of a committee to set up training camp activities
                    for servicemen, although the propriety of a man accused of disloyalty performing such tasks caused
                    some to protest.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> At Parsons's request Schlicher also wrote another
                    chapel talk in which he once more outlined his views on the war. The new talk was approved by the
                    president, delivered in chapel, and later printed in the school's newspaper, the <hi rend="i">Normal Advance</hi>.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> It was well received by some at Normal but
                    did not, said Schlicher, change the minds of those who counted.<hi rend="sup">62</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why Parsons waited two months before telling Schlicher of his dismissal is uncertain. It may have
                    been that he did not wish further to disrupt the school so early in the quarter. It may also have
                    been that he was trying to pave the way for the announcement. On January 29 the school newspaper
                    began a seven-part series on the peril of Pan-Germanism. In a preface the paper reminded its readers
                    of the statement that "a German smells the same alive or dead."<hi rend="sup">63</hi> The <hi rend="i">Advance</hi> also published an address by Frederick Mutterer, a professor
                    of German. Headlined "A Loyal American," the preface to the address lauded
                    Mutterer as an AMERICAN in the "truest sense of the word" despite the fact that he
                    had been born in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> Based on a chapel talk by Mutterer, the article may have been
                    orchestrated for the benefit of the institution and the public: following Schlicher's
                    departure, Mutterer became assistant professor of Latin.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> Why Parsons had
                    Schlicher give another chapel talk that might have gained him support is also a mystery. If there
                    was thought of giving Schlicher another reprieve, no concrete evidence has been found.</p>

            <p>When Schlicher finally received notice of his termination, it came almost as a relief. He began to
                    think of how he would make his living. He busied himself with the properties that he owned and with
                    his classes. He even attended faculty meetings, which he likened to a "man attending his
                    own funeral." He sensed a "growing chilliness" around him after word of
                    his dismissal spread. Some colleagues commiserated, but others kept their distance. Still marveling
                    at the intolerance of some of his peers, he wrote that those expressing sympathy were not the
                    "ones that do the talking at back doors."<hi rend="sup">66</hi> Schlicher wrote
                    the Board of Trustees but apparently received no reply. For a brief period in early April he had
                    hopes that opinions might be softening when he heard of a mysterious meeting in President
                    Parsons's office. His optimism was short-lived as nothing positive came of the gathering.
                    Slowly he accepted the inevitable. In a poignant scene recounted in his diary he walked around the
                    campus where he had spent most of his adult life. It seemed to him "not so bad and with
                    several fine new buildings the institution makes quite a good showing."<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In June the announcement of Schlicher's dismissal was made public. The newspapers noted it,
                    running matter-of-fact articles detailing the history of the controversy. Rather surprisingly, there
                    were no invective-filled editorials, no huzzahs for the squelching of disloyalty.<hi rend="sup">68</hi> No extant records document the reactions of the patriotic organizations, and at this
                    juncture the public in general seemed to take little notice. To some, however, the outcome had never
                    been in doubt. In his report to a Department of Justice investigator later in the year, Parsons
                    wrote, "I believe people who knew anything about the case and who watched the situation all
                    year expected nothing more or nothing less than what happened in Mr. Schlicher's
                        case."<hi rend="sup">69</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under the circumstances the president may have been correct. Few, if any, of the individuals who
                    might have altered the course of events attempted to do so. Schlicher, for example, did little to
                    help himself. A more cautious, less idealistic man would never have thought of altering the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Patriotic League's membership card. A less-principled one would not have
                    issued warnings, however "mild and thoughtful," to "superheated American
                    citizens" who were using "undemocratic methods at home."<hi rend="sup">70</hi> Schlicher admitted that his actions had created a wide gulf within Indiana State Normal,
                    but he apparently did nothing to mend <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>Frederick H. Weng, Schlicher's colleague and friend at Indiana State Normal, believed that
                    Ella Schlicher's pacifism contributed significantly to the professor's
                        dismissal;<hi rend="sup">72</hi> her attitudes and opinions in other matters may also have
                    exacerbated the situation. There is evidence, for example, that Ella Schlicher, President Parsons,
                    and the Board of Trustees had less than amicable feelings for one another. The problem stemmed in
                    part from Ella Schlicher's belief that she and her husband had paid too much for a house
                    sold to them by the school.<hi rend="sup">73</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever blame accrues to the Schlichers themselves, however, the Latin professor was not well served
                    by Indiana State Normal or by his colleagues. Although described by Parsons himself as
                    "scholarly, well trained…and a superior teacher," Schlicher was
                    discharged with little regard to his long, meritorious service.<hi rend="sup">74</hi> Even had his
                    manner and accomplishments spawned dislike or envy, the professor's peers should not so
                    quickly have abandoned him or, perhaps more importantly, the cause of academic freedom. President
                    Parsons, too, must accept a share of the blame. Certainly, Ella Schlicher pointed to him: her
                    husband, she said, held a "wider view of German achievements than the narrow president of
                    the college."<hi rend="sup">75</hi> If anyone could have stemmed the criticism of Schlicher
                    and forestalled the board's action, it would have been the school's revered
                        president.<hi rend="sup">76</hi> None of the other faculty rumored to have shared

            <p>Perhaps the best explanation of Schlicher's problems and of his eventual dismissal is the
                    most obvious one. In his history of Indiana State Teachers College, Lynch later commented about the
                    entire controversy, "If the public had been as sane in its thinking in
                    1917–1918" as in World War 11, Schlicher would have retained his job. Like other
                    such cases he became the victim of war hysteria.<hi rend="sup">77</hi> In 1917 and 1918 an aroused
                    America took little notice of constitutional or moral niceties if they were considered obstacles to
                    winning the war. Superpatriotism and intolerance abounded; in an "all or nothing"
                    time citizens were either "100% Americans" or suspects. Schlicher's case,
                    played out within this environment, was both typical and unique. As had been the case with many
                    others, his well-intentioned words and actions had damaged his reputation. Like Zeuch, he had
                    attempted to appeal to reason in unreasonable times. Like Schaper, he was fired despite his long
                    tenure and contributions to his school. The fact that he was not a newcomer as Zeuch was or that he
                    had not at any time supported <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> as Schaper had made little difference. His own peculiar circumstances combined with his
                    ethnic background and his contemporaries’ inflamed emotions during wartime to bring about
                    his dismissal.</p>
            <p>After leaving Indiana State Normal, Schlicher looked for another teaching job but found none. He sold
                    his property in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>

                    felt had been done to him, but no retribution was forthcoming. He wrote to the American Association
                    of University Professors’ Committee on Academic Freedom but was told that normal schools
                    were "outside the pale" of their jurisdiction and that they could do nothing for

            <p>Like few political leaders of his era, and few American radicals of any other generation, Eugene V.
                    Debs generated an enduring cult of hero worship. To his Socialist party comrades and to political
                    soul mates of the Left ever since, Debs was a secular saint, the center of a modern morality play. A
                    talented man who looked as if he were going to be an all-American success story, Debs gave up
                    personal security to become the voice of the downtrodden and dispossessed. Ignoring his own safety,
                    welfare, and even physical health, he spoke eloquently for victims of capitalism who would otherwise
                    not have been heard. Twice he went to jail for refusing to abandon his principles, the second time,
                    at the age of sixty-two, despite the urging of friends who feared that his unsteady health would not
                    survive the rigors of prison. Indeed, when he left prison after three years, he was sick; and he
                    died only five years later without ever regaining his earlier vigor, a martyr to the cause.</p>
            <p>Anyone who quickly read through his vita might wonder why he attracted such adoration. During most of
                    his career as a national union leader, he served as secretary-treasurer of the Brotherhood of
                    Locomotive Firemen and editor of the union's monthly journal. In those years there was no
                    better example than the BLF of the elitist, conservative, business unionism deplored by the Left.
                    Were it not for Debs's leadership of the 1894 Pullman strike, his union career would rate
                    barely more than a footnote <list type="footnotes">

                    admirers. Likewise, as a politician he hardly seems noteworthy, elected to no office higher than
                    Indiana state representative. As a five-time presidential candidate he averaged only 3 percent of
                    the popular vote and never exceeded 6 percent. Although he was a prolific writer, he added nothing
                    to left-wing political theory and even his most enthusiastic supporters would not claim an important
                    place for him in the history of American letters.</p>
            <p>Yet Debs endures. He rates far more scholarly attention than seemingly more prominent contemporaries.
                    He has been the subject of two prize-winning biographies,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> many other books, and
                    recently an edited three-volume collection of his letters published by the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Press. The only other American labor leaders who have received even close to the
                    scholarly recognition accorded Debs have been Samuel Gompers and John L. Lewis, both founders and
                    longtime presidents of the nation's two largest trade union federations.</p>
            <p>Few of the politicians who received millions more votes when they ran against him for the presidency
                    have attracted as much interest from historians. To obtain a quick approximation of Debs's
                    scholarly prominence, I compared the number of entries for Debs in the subject listings of my
                    university library with the number for his political opponents and contemporaries. With 19 entries,
                    there were more books about Debs than about any of the losing major party nominees of his era except
                    William Jennings Bryan (22 entries). No books were listed for Alton B. Parker, the 1904 Democratic
                    nominee; only one each for James M. Cox and John W. Davis, the 1920 and 1924 Democratic contenders;
                    only seven for Charles Evans Hughes, the 1916 Republican candidate (as much for his judicial career
                    as his political); and only 15 for Alfred Smith. As for the presidents of Debs's era, fewer
                    books were listed for Benjamin Harrison (91, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> G. Harding (181, and Calvin Coolidge (17) than for Debs. Grover <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> matched Debs (19). William Howard Taft (21) and William McKinley (27) barely exceeded
                    him. Only Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt have received significantly more scholarly
                    attention.</p>
            <p>Clearly admiration for and study of Debs depend on something other than conventional measures of
                    political or organizational success. Understanding why Debs generated veneration, both in his own
                    day and after, may help us not only to understand Debs but, as importantly, to understand something
                    about American politics and the functions of political symbolism within it.</p>

            <p>Nick Salvatore's Bancroft Prize-winning biography, <hi rend="i">Eugene V. Debs: Citizen and
                        Socialist</hi>, offered one plausible explanation. Debs, Salvatore argued, was able to represent
                    himself as the culmination of a long democratic republican tradition seriously threatened by
                    nineteenth-century capitalist development (and, some would argue, all but extinguished in our own
                    day). Debs did so, according to Salvatore, by equating socialist class conflict with the moral
                    dualism of evangelical Protestantism: Good vs. Evil; God vs. Mammon; Labor vs. Capital. Certainly
                    not all of his contemporaries accepted such an equation, not even all of his admirers, but
                    Debs's ability to wrap himself in the mantle of outraged radical democracy struggling
                    against evil allowed him to stand for something far more central to American culture and politics
                    than his socialist utopianism. Salvatore's Debs was a hero to at least some of his fellow
                    Americans because they agreed that fighting the encroachments of corporate capital was the manly,
                    patriotic, and Christian thing to do. He failed to convince more of his fellow Americans, according
                    to Salvatore, because so many of them were in the process of abandoning radical democracy for
                    bourgeois conservatism.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The publication of a three-volume collection of Debs's letters gives a wider audience of
                    historians ready access to a sampling of Salvatore's most important source. I found little
                    in the volumes that would lead me to present a very different picture of Debs, but after reading the
                    collection I understand better why Debs, unlike any other American socialist of his time or since,
                    was able to situate himself in the center arena of American political and cultural debate. The
                    volumes were expertly edited by J. Robert Constantine. The editor included a straightforward
                    thirty-six-page introductory biographical sketch of Debs as well as copious annotations identifying
                    nearly all of the events or individuals mentioned in the letters. I found little to quibble with in
                    the biographical sketch or annotations. The University of <placeName>

            <p>The volumes’ heavy emphasis on letters from late in Debs's career may be
                    disappointing to those who want to understand the evolution of his character. I had hoped to be able
                    to use the correspondence to learn more about Debs's background and early life and to trace
                    the shifts in his thinking as he changed from conservative craft unionist to socialist
                    revolutionary. Unfortunately, most of the collection covers the years after his conversion. Only
                    about 1 percent of the letters included in the three volumes were <list type="footnotes">

                    percent before 1897, the year Debs formally announced his conversion to socialism. I do not know
                    enough about the Debs papers to judge whether this simply reflects the actual distribution of the
                    collection or whether the editor chose to emphasize Debs's years of greatest prominence as
                    the Socialist party presidential candidate.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, there is ample material here to understand Debs's character and attitudes, at
                    least in the later parts of his career, and to understand his symbolic appeal to his audience.
                    American political culture is suffused with idealism and moral fervor; indeed, the very definition
                    of nationality is based on loyalty to a set of political values (liberty and justice for all) rather
                    than to territorial integrity or linguistic or ethnic identity. Yet American politics is a dirty
                    business, and American politicians, because of the coalitional nature of our party system, are far
                    more likely to be safe, conventional, and bureaucratic than inspirational and visionary. They are
                    rarely men of ideas. The more we know about them, the more they disappoint our moral expectations.
                    Ideas or social conscience in American politics rarely come from politicians. Politicians are
                    necessary but usually not to be trusted. Ideas and moral vision come from political outsiders.</p>
            <p>Debs probably could have been a successful political insider. While still in his twenties, he rose
                    rapidly in both Indiana politics and national railroad unionism, but he abandoned these prospects
                    and chose instead to be an outsider. Whether Debs consciously thought about his political role in
                    such a way, these letters reveal someone who positioned himself outside of and above the normal
                    political fray, in terms of both national politics and the factional wars within the Socialist
                    party. He avoided political infighting, but he jealously and vigorously defended his personal
                    reputation for political integrity, in effect assiduously cultivating his canonization at the same
                    time that he professed to reject any role as prophet or hero. For example, he (and his brother
                    Theodore, who served as his personal secretary and answered much of his mail) regularly answered the
                    most petty and small-minded scurrilous gossip about his finances and family life in copious and
                    lengthy detail.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> He seemed quick to take offense at any suggestion of personal
                    failing. One sentence at the end of a letter from an old friend urged Debs to do more for Industrial
                    Workers of the World prisoners in 1917 because, by being denied Debs's active presence,
                    "history…is being cheated." Debs replied with a lengthy and bitter
                    recitation of his many sacrifices for the IWW. "Who was the first <list type="footnotes">

                    party. Benjamin Hanford, Debs's vice-presidential running mate in both 1904 and 1908 wrote
                    Gene on the eve of the 1908 campaign: "The leader must attack-attack-attack. His shield

                    </placeName>, the editor of <hi rend="i">The Appeal to Reason</hi>, the country's largest

                    "I love you as no other man on earth and nothing would give me greater pain than to see you
                    dissipate your energy in the hopeless task of keeping the socialist party straight."

            <p>Debs's unique aura was perhaps best revealed in the reactions to his imprisonment for
                    opposition to American involvement in World War I. Nearly a quarter of the entire letter collection
                    consists of letters received from and replies to well-wishers while Debs served his prison term at
                    federal prisons in Moundsville, West <placeName>

                    of the American Left between 1919 and 1922: IWWs and Communists, left-wing socialists and prowar
                    socialists who had broken with the party in 1917, anarchists, feminists, civil libertarians, and
                    liberal public figures. Perhaps it is not surprising that Debs would be a unifying symbol for all of
                    the squabbling factions and sects struggling to survive the postwar Red Scare. The most striking
                    evidence of Debs's significance as an emotional symbol, however, are the letters by party
                    rank-and-filers. From a small-town Pennsylvania loyalist: "Dear Comrade how gladly would I
                    take your place if by so doing they would release you. Forgive me if I tell you that about a year
                    ago I wrote a letter to The Appeal and…to president Wilson…offering to take

            <p>It is hard to imagine that the political contemporaries who received millions more votes generated
                    this kind of veneration. Did President Harding's untimely death a few months after his
                    release of Debs produce as much grief beyond his family and acquaintances as Debs's
                    imprisonment? Perhaps it is not so strange that historians have accorded Debs more attention than
                    second-rate presidents. Our presidents rarely measure up as heroes. Quite rightfully John <placeName>

                    detractors to smear his reputation with tales of marital infidelity, Martin Luther King will remain
                    a bigger icon in the American pantheon than any of the politicians who wooed him, ignored him, or
                    opposed him. And even the collapse of misbegotten Communist utopias in the East will not turn
                    historians away from Saint Gene.</p>

                    historical contributions made by Editor and Project Director Eleanor Arnold and the countless
                    Extension women, both interviewers and interviewees, who have recorded the revealing recollections
                    of rural lifestyles, customs, and values. As with the earlier volumes, however, <hi rend="i">Living
                        Rich Lives</hi> evades some crucial questions for understanding the history of women and
                    families.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Living Rich Lives</hi> has three major sections, each with additional topical divisions.
                    "Wooings and Weddings" recalls first meetings with husbands, honeymoons, and
                    shivarees as well as courtships and weddings; "Women's Families" has a
                    segment on "Starting Together" and information on childbearing, childrearing,
                    church, retirement, and widowhood; "Women's Work" covers work at home,
                    paid employment outside the home, women's roles in society, and women's values.</p>
            <p>There is some repetition of material on childbearing, childrearing, and housework from earlier
                    volumes, but the unasked or unanswered questions about women's private lives are more
                    troubling. <hi rend="i">Living Rich Lives</hi>, like <hi rend="i">Girlhood Days</hi>, leaves the
                    reader wondering what roles mothers, other relatives, or, as was often true for urban working-class
                    youth, peers and popular culture played in the girls’ sexual educations. A query about

                    is no other information on sexual attraction or activity during their youths and courtships.
                    Although some interviewees had large families, many had only two children. How did they limit
                    fertility, and where did they obtain knowledge of birth control and contraceptives? There are only
                    glimpses of those who fell outside the norm of an enduring Christian marriage. "Nobody ever
                    got a divorce," one woman asserted, but another recalled that her "biggest
                    failure" was a divorce she "had to learn to live above…" (pp.
                    230, 129). Did she receive support or approbation from the good Christian homemakers in her
                    community? Because oral history is so effective in ferreting out details of lives not found in
                    written sources, gaps like these are regrettable, especially with the easy rapport between
                    interviewers and interviewees evident in this series.</p>
            <p>The disappointing aspects of <hi rend="i">Living Rich Lives</hi> are outweighed by the many
                    illuminating sketches of rural customs and experiences, three of which are the social roles of
                    churches, weddings and postnuptial celebrations, and multigenerational households. In small
                    communities churches were social centers for all ages, but they were particularly important for
                    young adults. A Scott County woman who married in 1914 explained, "You met your husband at
                    church; there wasn't anywhere else to meet him; you didn't go anyplace else. When
                    you went anywhere, you went to church" (p. 23). Following Sunday evening church youths
                    often gathered in homes for small parties. "We had five churches in a five mile
                    square," a <placeName>

                    would go wherever there was church that night" (p. 25).</p>
            <p>Although churches apparently facilitated social mingling and romance, they were seldom the site of
                    the small and simple weddings recalled by the vast majority of homemakers. Comments by a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Grant County</region>
                    </placeName> woman are typical: "Most of the weddings when I was married-you never heard of
                    a church wedding. Most of them just went to the courthouse and got their marriage license and then
                    went to the minister's home or to the justice of the peace" (p. 45). Following the
                    ceremony the bride's mother served a dinner for the couple, the few guests, and the
                    minister. Some of the older interviewees emphasized the importance of an infare dinner hosted by the
                    groom's family the day after the wedding. The infare was a conscious merging of extended
                    families, "the gathering of all the relations on both sides to wish the bride and groom a
                    long, happy and useful life…" (p. 50). The shivaree, which occurred sometime
                    during the first week after a marriage, was another rural custom with clear expectations: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            and then they stay as long as they want (pp. 66–67).</p>
                    </quote> Several couples were also "kidnapped" and taken for rides throughout the
                    countryside, and it is not surprising that some women were "scared to death" at
                    the prospect of their shivarees (pp. 70, 71).</p>
            <p>Finally, multigenerational households were quite common in rural Indiana, particularly when a son
                    went to work on the family farm. <hi rend="i">Living Rich Lives</hi> provides fascinating insights
                    into the complex dynamics of these households. What some thought would be only a temporary
                    expediency proved to be a lifelong arrangement. Although both generations of women had to make
                    adjustments, there was little doubt about who was in charge. "So we just lived with his
                    mother and helped take care of the farm," one woman recalled. "Of course, she was
                    the head of the house and I did as she wanted" (p. 79). Pearl McCall remembered her own
                    mother's <pb n="60" id="VAA4025-088-1-066"/> words: "My mother gave me the best
                    advice that any mother could have given her daughter. She said, ‘Pearl, you are going in
                    that house up there, and just remember that it is her house’ " (p. 126).
                    Although it was sometimes hard, McCall followed this counsel and "didn't have the
                    difficulties that a lot of girls had, because…she was never sharp and she was lenient
                    about a lot of things" p. 126). Family historians have examined landholding patterns within
                    families, but the homemakers' remarks suggest that there is also much to be learned about
                    the internal dynamics of rural families.</p>
            <p>The entire <hi rend="i">Memories of Hoosier Homemakers</hi> series deserves a wide readership, for
                    each volume contains fascinating material on Indiana's rural past. Individuals offering
                    courses in Indiana, twentieth-century, family, or women's history should consider adding
                    one of these volumes to their course reading lists. The recollections recorded by the Indiana
                    Extension Homemakers Association are rich primary sources for undergraduates who too often feel no
                    connection with the past.</p>

                    the rich heritage of this largely agricultural community. This is a good, old-fashioned county
                    history with some new twists. The organization of Volume I is precise. Topically arranged, it
                    encompasses the major facets of the county's experiences from its earliest years. Indeed,
                    it takes the form of a published version of a local historical society's files. It is quick

                    the area newspapers, compose most of the volume. The most enticing aspect of the book are the many

                    </placeName>, for in some significant ways it is not. It may more accurately be described as a
                    source book. There is little attempt to analyze the forces that have shaped the community, and there
                    is no critical assessment of the many developments in <placeName>

                    "history," for there is a great deal of raw material that wonderfully reveals the <placeName>

                    photographs, though it would be helpful if they were accompanied by source citations. The work also
                    abounds in lists of all kinds, from compilations of all the <placeName>

            <p>Edward K. Spann traces the story of the cooperationist effort in America from the time of Robert
                    Owen's experiment in southern Indiana to the rise and fall of Debsian socialism in the era
                    of World War I. He focuses upon the secular side of the account, although from time to time he
                    contrasts it with expressions of religious com-munitarianism, including groups such as the
                    Harmonists and the <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-088-1-070"/> Shakers. Elements of this tradition of
                    "radical social idealism" (p. xiii) will be familiar to those acquainted with
                    utopian themes in American social and cultural history-<placeName>

                    Backward</hi>, the Industrial Workers of the World, and New Llano. These and a host of other
                    particular expressions of the hope for a better tomorrow through cooperation occupy Spann's
                    attention.</p>
            <p>But this volume is more than a catalog of those committed to the cooperative ideal. It is rather a
                    detailed genetic history linking the various manifestations of associationism, showing what they
                    shared and where they differed. Spann, for example, describes the various appropriations made of the
                    social ideas of the Frenchman Charles Fourier, including his doctrine of Passional Attraction that
                    called for acceptance of the passions as dynamic forces for good. Fourier's views went
                    through modifications at the hands of his American disciples who adapted the structures of the
                    phalanx and combined his ideas with their own notions about the future.</p>
            <p>Spann does not write as a totally disinterested historian. On the contrary, he is explicit about the
                    hope that his story will contribute "toward reinvigorating the stagnated social
                    imaginations of Americans" (p. xv) who today face the task of dealing with a troubled
                    world. He expresses his own faith in the cooperative vision. Without such ideals future prospects
                    seem dim to him. "Indeed," he writes, "in a world where calculation and
                    force outrun social imagination, it is possible that without some cooperative ideal, there may be no
                    tomorrow at all" (p. 282).</p>
            <p>Several observations are in order. Spann's choice of the title <hi rend="i">"Brotherly</hi> Tomorrows" is strangely insensitive to the fact that these
                    cooperative experiments included many women as well as men. His sharp division between religious and
                    secular groups seems strained at times. The Progressive Shakers of the late nineteenth century, for
                    example, were motivated by both religious and secular ideals. On the other hand, Spann makes a very
                    persuasive case why Americans were not attracted to Marxist socialism but rather chose other forms
                    of cooperation.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Snowbelt Cities</hi> is more coherent than many collections of essays by diverse hands.
                    Bernard's introduction describes a protocol that most contributors clearly agreed to follow
                    emphasizing rough measures of population growth and decline and the participation of a set of large,
                    loosely defined groups ("business," blacks, Hispanics, ethnics,
                    "yuppies") in mayoral politics. Each city essay provides a narrative history of
                    mayoral politics during the postwar period focusing on the effectiveness of municipal officials and
                    policies in coping with the challenge of economic and racial change. Bernard concludes that
                    "apart from the neighborhood protectionists, these groups generally agreed on the
                    growth-oriented policies long advocated by business" (p. 19). Snowbelt cities differed from
                    their sunbelt counterparts, he suggests, not in their aims but in the greater "relative
                    power" of their "nonbusiness groups."</p>
            <p>Collectively, the individual city essays provide a wealth of detailed information about postwar
                    municipal politics. Most of the authors do an excellent job within the fifteen to thirty pages they
                    are allowed (<placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> is particularly successful in covering a story of intense conflict over mayoral
                    nominations, economic policy, and race relations. The essays on three cities where Bernard judges
                    "business interests" to be "clearly in control" (p. 19) are
                    among the most coherent, perhaps because they have simpler stories to tell; these include Zane L.
                    Miller and Bruce Tucker's essay on <placeName>

               <hi rend="i">Snowbelt Cities</hi> leaves much to be done. It is not based on a sophisticated economic
                    analysis. It largely ignores the federal, state, and county policies that have shaped the economic
                    and social fates of individual cities. The essays on individual cities (with the notable exception
                    of Barrows's on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

               <hi rend="i">Making a New Deal</hi> is an important book that makes a major contribution to labor and
                    modern American history. Its principal achievement is its richly detailed and persuasive
                    presentation of working people as actors rather than as mere reactors or victims. By endowing <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s workers with agency, Lizabeth Cohen effectively challenges scholars who have
                    studied the 1920s and 1930s from the top down or the outside in and who have attributed the events
                    of those two crucial and turbulent decades to everyone and everything except working people
                    themselves.</p>
            <p>One of the few social histories of workers in the twentieth century, <hi rend="i">Making a New
                    Deal</hi> examines aspects of working-class life in the 1920s and 1930s heretofore largely ignored.
                    The book has new and important things to say about class relations within ethnic communities, the
                    relationship of working people to mass culture, and workers' response to welfare
                    capitalism. It also uses social history to reassess the emergence of mass production unionism in the
                    1930s. Arguing that workers advocated a form of political economy that she labels "moral
                    capitalism," Cohen offers a fresh examination of their relationship to politics and the
                    state. In so doing she reminds readers of the importance of the New Deal to the working class,
                    challenges the corporate liberal thesis for the origins and character of the New Deal, and compels
                    consideration of the distinctiveness of working-class politics in the 1930s. Cohen moves beyond
                    conventional, workplace-oriented accounts to offer a social history of the union drives of the
                    Congress of Industrial Organizations. Describing the CIO's efforts to construct and defend
                    a culture of unity, Cohen establishes, for example, the importance of radio broadcasts, baseball and
                    bowling leagues, union buttons, and women's auxiliaries, aspects of the 1930s that have
                    been overlooked, dismissed, or trivialized. By resisting the tendency to view the events of the
                    1930s in light of what happened after 1940 and by placing those events in historical and social
                    context, Cohen effectively renders the CIO a social movement and demonstrates how important the CIO
                    was to working people themselves.</p>
            <p>The book is not without problems. The meanings of gender at work and their significance for the CIO
                    and the working class merited greater consideration. Cohen is not blind to the problem of gender.
                    Indeed the integration of women and women's experience into the narrative and the analysis
                    is one of the contributions she makes to the literature on labor in the 1920s and 1930s. But gender
                    was more problematic, more significant, and more central than <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-088-1-073"/>
                    <hi rend="i">Making a New Deal</hi> would suggest. Cohen, for example, overlooks the ways in which
                    the concept of moral capitalism was gendered and the extent to which the CIO's endorsement
                    of conventional gender ideology undermined the ability of all workers-male and female-to challenge
                    employers. By paying the subject insufficient attention, Cohen misses an opportunity to strengthen
                    the book's larger argument. This weakness, however, does not seriously detract from the
                    book's great merit. Extensively researched, provocatively and compellingly argued, <hi rend="i">Making a New Deal</hi> is an impressive achievement.</p>

               </hi> is well written and beautifully produced with numerous black-and-white and
                    color photographs and illustrations. Kramer offers no over-arching thesis, and he breaks no new
                    ground; but there are several reasons why historians and lay persons will want to read this book.
                    First, while Kramer does not equate community development with "progress," he
                    points out that community success in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is now and always has been economic success. Second, Kramer argues convincingly that
                    the key to economic success has never been a mystery. It was and is a function of available natural
                    resources, transportation, capital, and imaginative leadership. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName> possessed all of these, and it flourished. Also, it did not hurt that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Frankfort</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the state capital.</p>
            <p>Some town and county histories are little more than tributes to great families and records of
                    entrepreneurial activity. Leading families and entrepreneurs can be found in <hi rend="i">Capital on
                        the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi>, but, when defining "leadership," Kramer emphasizes neither
                        <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-088-1-074"/> particular families nor particular individuals. Rather, he
                    argues perceptively that community building in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName> and in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was usually a cooperative affair involving local leaders and federal, state, and local
                    government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Capital on the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> is a thoughtful and thought-provoking book. Kramer reminds readers that, if <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName>'s experience was typical, community building always meant having something to
                    sell, someone to sell it to, and some way to get it there. It is a point to ponder as Americans
                    drive made-somewhere-else automobiles over deteriorating roads while wondering whatever happened to
                    the railroads.</p>

            <p>This useful collection draws together thirteen essays by noted professional historians who were
                    originally commissioned by the American Historical Association to acquaint high school teachers
                    "with the most up-to-date historical scholarship" (p. vii). The essays-seven on
                    conventional chronological periods and six on such "themes" as labor, women, and
                    diplomacy-vary in quality, but they present a sensible accounting of major interpretive issues and a
                    helpful guide to significant recent books and articles. Accordingly, <hi rend="i">The New American
                        History</hi> will be of interest to teachers, graduate students, and anyone curious about where
                    the study of American history has been and where it may-or may not-be going.</p>
            <p>Understandably, the volume exudes a strong sense of satisfaction. As the editor, Eric Foner, and the
                    other contributors make plain, American historians have achieved a great deal over the last
                    generation. They have shattered an older progressive view of national history centered on politics
                    and powerful white men; they have broadened the definition of history by insisting on the centrality
                    of such less-powerful people as workers, immigrants, women, Native Americans, and African Americans;
                    and they have enriched the practice of history by using demography, statistics, and social
                    scientific theory. In recounting these achievements the book also reveals the tricky balancing act
                    crucial to contemporary historiography: the simultaneous contentions that America has seen
                    inequality and oppression but that ordinary Americans have nonetheless made their own lives with
                    creativity and dignity.</p>
            <p>There are one or two clouds on the horizon of <hi rend="i">The New American History</hi>. Despite the
                    emphasis on the breadth of modern historical <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-088-1-075"/> writing, there are
                    no essays here on economic, cultural, or intellectual history. There is mostly silence about the
                    rise of corporate business and the power of American nationalism. The editor and some of the
                    essayists are uncomfortably aware that the new history has not produced a new synthesis. There are a
                    couple of gestures toward such a synthesis here: Sean Wilentz suggests the importance of the
                    "market revolution" for antebellum America; Foner proposes "the
                    centrality of slavery to the course of nineteenth-century American history" (p. 78). But
                    this book's strength is the summary of fragmented literatures, not new interpretation. For
                    all its virtues, <hi rend="i">The New American History</hi> leaves the reader with an uneasy
                    feeling. The authors, all fine historians, rightly will not accept a progressive interpretation of
                    American history, in which things are inevitably getting better. But, ironically, they have
                    contributed to a progressive view of American historiography, in which the "new"
                    historians have necessarily surpassed the work of the old. Twenty years from now it will be
                    interesting to see what the authors of <hi rend="i">The New, New American History</hi> make of the
                    scholarship so effectively summed up in this helpful book.</p>

            <p>Francis Paul Prucha's <hi rend="i">Atlas of American Indian Affairs</hi> is a grand slam in
                    the arena of reference works. Hours of fascination await curious students, while researchers will
                    find the atlas invaluable for corroborating data.</p>
            <p>The atlas is unique. Statistical data are presented through a series of 109 excellent maps that
                    visually and spatially depict <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Indian policy. Succinct introductions, along with detailed explanatory notes and
                    references, provide the only orientation to the wealth of information in the maps. Contents include
                    culture and tribal areas, Native American populations (including Alaska), land cessions,
                    reservations, government schools and hospitals, <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>), and special interest historic events. A series of maps about the history of
                    post-Civil War Indian wars by cartographer Rafael D. Palacios strengthens the collection.</p>
            <p>The atlas should sustain research interest and encourage further investigations. For example, Indiana
                    historians, in tracing the shifts of Native American populations in the state and region, will
                    observe remarkable growth from 125 in 1920 to 7,682 in 1980. <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-088-1-076"/>
                    Why? Investigate further. The maps are meant to stimulate readers to question and to seek more
                    information.</p>
            <p>Although this reference tool will delight experts and specialists in Native American history, others
                    may find it overwhelming, especially when they attempt to interpret those maps dealing with census
                    enumeration of American Indians. At times, the data markers obscure and confuse. The notes and
                    references on populations must be used along with the maps. Despite such minor problems, anyone
                    interested in Native American poeple will not be disappointed with Prucha's <hi rend="i">Atlas</hi>. It is a valuable compendium of information and will prove an excellent, useful
                    addition to private and public libraries.</p>

            <p>William Maclure made one of the first geological surveys in North America, crossing large tracts of
                    the eastern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to produce both commentary and geological map in 1809. This work and several papers
                    influenced a generation of American geologists. Maclure was also a pioneer in attempts at
                    educational reform in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The editor of Maclure's journals notes in the preface that "few
                    glimpses of Maclure's impact upon the development of American science have been seen up to
                    the present" (p. xv) and that still fewer are available about his work in educational
                    reform. The publication of his journals should stimulate renewed interest in Maclure and provide
                    much needed insight into the development of his ideas, particularly in geology.</p>
            <p>Between 1805 and 1815 and again from 1820 to 1825 Maclure traveled extensively in Europe. Throughout
                    his travels he made careful notes about local geology while he collected rocks for schools and
                    scientific institutions in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. His journals provide the opportunity to study the extent and detail of his
                    observations and their relationship to ideas expressed in his papers. Carefully transcribed with
                    attention to "translating" abbreviations and cryptic comments into smooth and
                    readable text, the journals give vivid impressions of the countryside, the people, the social
                    structure, the education, and the politics of many of the places Maclure visited, as well as the
                    geology. Extensive annotations give the reader a clear understanding of what Maclure saw and
                    experienced. Twenty-six appendixes include materials ranging from brief notes found at the beginning
                    or end of some of the journals <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-088-1-077"/> to expense accounts, lists of
                    rocks, a long essay on banks and banking, and an essay on geology written in 1805 and found at the
                    end of the second journal. The latter is especially interesting because of the relationship it bears
                    to Maclure's famous "Essay on formation of rocks" (1818).</p>
            <p>Maps, diagrams, and sketches found in the journals are reproduced, and new maps show the route of
                    Maclure's travels. A lengthy introduction provides an excellent biographical sketch of

            <p>Ronald E. Shaw has produced a handsome and useful survey of the canal era in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Surprisingly, there has been no such general study since Alvin Harlow's 1926
                        <hi rend="i">Old Towpaths</hi>. Shaw's new book nicely synthesizes two generations of
                    scholarship on American canals and the economic impact of these waterways in a treatment that
                    combines descriptive narrative with historiographical review. Historians will find this work the
                    most convenient source for important canal particulars and a ready reference, via the notes, to the
                    monographic literature; general readers will find a pleasant survey of the facts with just enough
                    interpretive shaping to give the volume coherence.</p>
            <p>After a brief look at "Pioneer Canals and Republican Improvements," Shaw, in his
                    next four chapters, tours the country geographically, noting the most important regional projects as
                    well as many lesser ditches (and some that just plain failed). (Indiana readers will find their
                    familiar internal improvement story embedded in its regional context.) Details such as the names of
                    promoters and engineers, dates of incorporation, sums of money expended, volumes of traffic, and
                    sizes of canals, locks, and typical boats lend specific integrity to these quick descriptions.</p>
            <p>Some of the best reading in this volume comes in chapter six, where Shaw discusses the problems of
                    engineering, technological innovation, labor, and working conditions that were common to all canals.
                    The social history context of the construction and operation of these waterways comes into focus
                    briefly, as do selections from contemporary travel narratives. Chapter seven takes a similarly <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-088-1-078"/> comprehensive view of politics and economic impact, although
                    these difficult questions resist synthesis more stubbornly.</p>
            <p>Throughout this volume the importance of the canal era in American development is reaffirmed, if not
                    aggressively argued. Readers who doubt this premise will likely not be persuaded, but scholars
                    inclined to agree with Shaw's assessment will appreciate the convenient package he has
                    assembled. Ironically, these "canals for a nation" were not built for a nation.
                    Even projects receiving federal support served primarily local competitive interests, and their
                    integration into networks was inadvertent at best. This raises tough analytical questions that Shaw
                    recognizes but does not resolve. Scholars will find much here on which to build.</p>

            <p>Glancing at David Glassberg's near 300-page account of American historical pageantry during
                    the Progressive era, this reviewer initially reacted, "Surely the author has told us more
                    about historical pageants than we want to know!" Initial skepticism quickly fades, however,
                    as Glassberg unfolds yet another interesting variation on the seemingly never-ending story of how
                    individuals find ways to make use of their own past.</p>
            <p>Gracefully interweaving local historical pageantry into the broader context of American history,
                    Glassberg makes a major contribution by demonstrating how various groups and organizations used the
                    pageant to further their own cause. Whether patriotic boosters looking for community identity,
                    progressive educators who hoped to expose the masses to a bit of history, or entrepreneurs spotting
                    the value of commercial entertainment, they all jumped on the pageantry bandwagon during the early
                    years of the twentieth century. The movement reached its zenith just before World War I, culminating
                    in the creation of the American Pageant Association in 1913.</p>
            <p>Tracing the rise of the movement from America's enthusiastic interest in local history in
                    the late nineteenth century-state and local historical societies more than doubled between 1870 and
                    1890 (pp. 13–14)-the author describes how the pageant became a democratizing tool for the
                    moral reformers of the Progressive era who hoped to use it to combine mass recreation and patriotic
                    education. Though the pageantry movement was influenced by the British <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-088-1-079"/> arts and crafts movement (which itself had borrowed heavily from
                    aristocratic medieval and renaissance motifs), Glassberg emphasizes how it quickly developed
                    uniquely American historical themes, which were often a mirror image of the public imagination. Much
                    of the focus is on patriotic and hereditary societies, educators, and social workers of the
                    playground movement, all of whom "considered this new form of civic holiday celebration
                    peculiarly suited to advance their goals in public" (p. 52).</p>
            <p>Although the reader sometimes founders in a sea of local detail, Glassberg prevents total submersion
                    by ultimately connecting the story to broader historical themes. Even class, race, and gender wend
                    their way into his story. A women's suffrage pageant in <placeName>

                    pageant in the same year. For the most part, however, blacks, as well as Native Americans, were
                    presented in stereotypical roles-blacks as comic buffoons, Indians attacking helpless whites.</p>

                    A. Thornburg. (Hamden, Conn: Archon Books, 1991. Pp. 197. Illustrations, selected bibliography,

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Galloping Bungalows</hi> focuses on an American subculture of year-round trailer
                    residents that flourished from the midthirties to about 1960. The book's main interest is
                    the "true" trailerite, defined by David A. Thornburg as someone who had no other
                    residence but the trailer, had willingly chosen a nomadic lifestyle, and moved regularly from place
                    to place. Americans too poor to afford any other form of housing, as well as the many forced into
                    trailers during World War II because of a lack of housing, are not included in his definition, for
                    it was not wanderlust but a more basic need that forced them to take up trailer residence. Allen
                    Wallis's recent <hi rend="i">Wheel Estate: The Rise and Decline of Mobile Homes</hi> (1991)
                    emphasizes the history of the trailer or mobile home as a flexible, low-cost alternative to
                    conventional housing.</p>
            <p>Thornburg narrows his story to what is actually his own story, for he was the only child of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> natives who lived and moved about in house trailers from 1940 to 1955. He describes his
                    parents as archetypal trailerites who were never "entirely comfortable in <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-088-1-080"/>

               </figure> the 1930s middle-class mold" (p. 58). Thornburg identifies the first generation
                    of trailerites as married, middle-income, midwestern city dwellers (with rural roots), who were
                    above average in education with one or no children (many trailerites were retirees), a precise
                    description of his parents. Although Thornburg describes the trailerites as unconventional
                    progressives, leading an alternative lifestyle, the very homogeneity of the group and the insularity
                    of the trailer park suggest that perhaps the trailerites were fleeing, rather than flaunting, the
                    new American order, that they were attempting to escape the urban mix of blacks, Jews, and
                    immigrants, as well as increasing governmental influence and regulation, in favor of a cozy
                    community of like-minded rural Protestant midwesterners. Thornburg cannot make up his mind on this
                    point, for he argues both sides in his description of the trailerite population. Although
                    trailerites were found in greatest numbers in warm climates, this is a midwestern story. Small
                    companies dotted the midwestern landscape, with the greatest concentration of house trailer
                    manufacturers located around <placeName>

            <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-088-1-081"/>
            <p>The book's organization is maddeningly circuitous, often wandering-like the trailerite-and
                    repetitive. Thornburg ends his story in 1960 with the lifting of the eight-foot wide limit for house
                    trailers, which he argues led to the sedentary behemoths we call mobile homes and the end of the
                    trailerite community, but that does not seem a satisfactory explanation for the death of the
                    trailerite lifestyle.</p>

            <p>Richard Aquila has drawn on his knowledge and obvious love of rock and roll to compile this
                    interesting guide to the music during its early period. Following a few (too) short introductory
                    chapters, the bulk of the book is devoted to charts, lists, and biographical information. First,
                    various highlights from 1954 to 1963 present a backdrop to the music. Next, there are forty-nine
                    topical lists of songs as well as their dates and performers, ranging from various rock and roll
                    styles, such as country rock and folk music, to songs about youth, parties, school, cars, teenage
                    slang, sex and morality, surfing, food, teenage rebellion, religion, gender, ethnic and racial
                    stereotypes, alcohol, history, the cold war, to name just a few. List #49 includes the greatest hits
                    from each of the years covered. The last half of the book includes short discussions of both
                    significant and obscure performers and groups, focusing on their most important records. Starting
                    with Billy Abbott &amp; the Jewels and ending with John Zacherle ("The Cool
                    Ghoul"), the list appears quite comprehensive, with longer sections on Elvis Presley and a
                    few of the other giants. Most of the very short descriptions attempt to explain the importance of
                    each performer, which is not always easy.</p>
            <p>There are, of course, numerous other guides to and lists of rock and roll records and performers.
                    Many are rather bulky. Aquila has presented a rather comprehensive study that is manageable. A few
                    problems exist. The absence of a real definition of rock and roll leads to the inclusion of
                    individuals and records that are perhaps on the fringe. There is also little attempt to adhere to
                    the chronological guidelines. While the author emphasizes that the music seemingly reflects the
                    concerns of youth at the time, he does not discuss the role of the record companies and other
                    aspects of the record business, including the radio stations and disc jockeys, concert <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-088-1-082"/> promoters, and many others, which created as well as fed the market for
                    such music. Particularly important was the relationship between the major and independent record
                    companies, reflecting the blacky white dichotomy that pervaded the industry. Aquila has thus
                    compiled a book more important for its information and curiosities than its interpretations.</p>

                    designed to enable historians to record the life and events of their locales. This particular study
                    is the most useful guide yet available for any historian who aspires to publish a valid, effective
                    history of either a business firm, an entrepreneur, or the commercial life of a community.
                    Unfortunately, many business histories are written by one of three types of authors: the inspired
                    amateur who lacks the research and writing skills necessary to compile a useful history; the public
                    relations-oriented corporate insider who paints too glowing a picture of the company; and, one must
                    admit, the academic historian whose tone and writing style often make the business history
                    unintelligible to the general reader.</p>

                    </placeName> show the historian how to make business history both valid and interesting. They
                    explain how to look for research materials from a variety of sources, how to work with corporate
                    officers, and how to present and publish the history. Above all, they exhort the historian to view
                    the history of a business in its larger context, using the explanation of concentric circles to show
                    how the elements of a business's history affect not only the firm but also the community,
                    its families, and its other social and political institutions.</p>

                    hope to reach the nonacademic historian as well as the history teacher. Indiana readers will find
                    the book's emphasis on the histories of small and medium-sized business especially valuable

                    the gumption to write and publish their memories of childhood. Her tales of life in Woodruff Place, <placeName>

                    everyday events of a time long ago. Enhanced by wonderful illustrations, this reminiscence is an

                    one-room school with no electricity or running water. The rural, isolated life he recalls is perhaps
                    closer to that of Abe Lincoln's southern Indiana than of the late twentieth century. <hi rend="i">James H. <placeName>

                    McCormick`s memoir provides fascinating details of life on ship and ashore, including a
                    "Dear John" letter he received thousands of miles from home. The most exciting <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-088-1-085"/> portions of the narrative recount the sinking of the

                    National Archives and even to a warm friendship with the U-boat commander who sank his ship. This is
                    a well-told story that brings to life many facets of the World War II experience. <hi rend="i">James

                    history. We hope to present such a list in each March issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of

                    hope that readers will help us by sending items for possible inclusion. We are especially interested

                    that are not normally reviewed in the IMH. Generally, we will not list newspaper articles or
                    accounts of local historical society activities, but printed pamphlets as well as journal articles
                    may be listed. All such items for the March, 1993, issue must be received by November 1, 1992. Many
                    people have contributed to the present list, but major responsibility has rested with Leigh Darbee
