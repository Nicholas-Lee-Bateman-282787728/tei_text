            <p>One aspect of the history of New France that has not attracted sufficent interest from historians is
                    the role of prominent families in the frontier fur trade and military activity. Far from being a
                    narrow exercise in family history, such studies can aid in unravelling the twisted fibers of the
                    frontier social fabric.</p>
            <p>During the French regime between ten and fifteen Quebec families exerted their control from Montreal
                    to the Hudson's Bay and southward to the Illinois country. A few of these families had an
                    even broader sweep, with influence and economic power in Acadia, Louisiana, and Santo Domingo. This
                    influence was not exercised only by writing memoranda from Montreal: rather, these key families sent
                    their sons, as officers of marine or as licensed merchants, to posts throughout New France.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Legardeur de Repentigny family is representative of this élite. Originally of the
                    minor nobility in Normandy, several members of the family moved to New France during the 1630s. By
                    1700 the Legardeurs had an established military and trade position that spread throughout half the
                    continent. By the end of the French regime in 1760 they had further increased their prestige. Many
                    of them became lieutenants and captains of marines, and several served as officials in Quebec and
                    Montreal. Legardeurs served as commandants or officers in second at Fort Frontenac, Detroit,
                    Mackinac, Sault Ste. Marie, Green Bay, Fort St. Joseph, and the Sea of the West (western Lake
                    Superior). Because of their positions, they could assure <list type="footnotes">

                    licenses necessary to participate in the lucrative fur trade.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A few other families paralleled the Legardeurs in this stranglehold on military and trade affairs.
                    For forty years the Marin de La Malgue family practically owned modern Wisconsin and Minnesota. The
                    Dagneau Douville (De Quindre) family had a military-trade network stretching from Post of the Miamis
                    to Detroit and on to the north shore of Lake Superior. From the 1720s on, the Gaultier de La
                    Vérandrye family exercised a near-monopoly on the trade permits and naming of officers at
                    the posts to the west of Lake Superior.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These families shared two characteristics: they were of the minor nobility of France and among the
                    colonial élite in Canada. Although they were untitled (such as count or baron), they were
                    at least <hi rend="i">ecuyers</hi>, the standard term used to identify a noble without a title. In
                    New France, where there were few marquis, counts, or barons, to be an <hi rend="i">ecuyer</hi> was a
                    mark of great prestige, a position that usually led to officer commissions in the marines.
                    Furthermore, wealthy merchants married many of their daughters into this colonial élite,
                    thus adding financial power to the military-nobility status.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Drouet de Richerville family,<hi rend="sup">5</hi> so prominent in the history of Vincennes,
                    Ouiatanon, and Fort Wayne, was part of this élite. From the 1720s, when several members
                    of the family entered the fur trade, until the death of Jean-Baptiste Richardville in 1841, the
                    Drouets were one of the most significant families of officers-traders in the western Great Lakes
                    region.</p>
            <p>The first of the family in the New World was Claude Drouet de Richerville, who arrived in Canada in
                    the late 1680s as a cadet. He had been born in 1665 to Claude Drouet, <hi rend="i">ecuyer</hi>,

            </p>
            <p>The nobility and prominence of the Drouet family date from the twelfth century and in the following
                    centuries the family produced many seigneurs, military leaders, lawyers, and judges. The family name
                    was Drouet, but in most cases the men usually added a <hi rend="i">nom de lieu</hi> (place-name) to
                    indicate one of the family's many land holdings. This practice carried over into the New
                    World, where various family members were known as Drouet de Baudricourt, Drouet de Mareuil, Drouet
                    de Bajolet, and so forth.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Claude Drouet de Richerville had an undistinguished career in New France. In 1687, at Champlain, he
                    married Marie-Jeanne Desrosiers.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> They had a large family—ten
                    children—and these decendants, too, were prolific. Claude's position as cadet in
                    the troops was that reserved for young nobles or sons of colonial officers. Most cadets served at
                    least five years before they were commissioned as officers. By 1702, Claude was a second ensign in
                    the marines, the lowest of the commissioned ranks, yet the highest rank he ever attained. Probably
                    because of his large family he always requested garrison duty in the cities of eastern Canada. Thus,
                    he never went to the western posts where wealth and possibilities for promotion were greater but
                    where family living was inconvenient.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>The various fitness reports of officers list Claude but, aside from an occasional comment on his age,
                    do not reveal either shortcomings or strengths.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> This was the price one paid
                    for garrison duty. In 1734 he requested that he be allowed to retire and that his rank of ensign be
                    granted to a son, Michel-Ignace Drouet de Baudricourt. Both requests were granted.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> In 1736, wishing to assure his family in the good graces of authorities in <list type="footnotes">

            <p>By the early 1730s many of the Drouet de Richerville sons were engaged actively in the western trade.
                    In 1731 Louis Drouet de La Gravière was trading at Mackinac; in 1733 Etienne Drouet de
                    Belecart traded at Ouiatanon; a "Drouette, sr de Richarvilie," traded at Detroit
                    in 1736; another "Drouet de Richardville" traded at Kaskaskia in 1738. These
                    notices, a few culled from the extensive trade permits extant, indicate the widespread area in which
                    the Drouet family operated.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The French campaign against the Chickasaw Indians in 1736 significantly affected the Drouet de
                    Richervilles. The Canadian contingent left Montreal in June, 1736, under the Baron de Longueuil,
                    gathering other troops in the Midwest and descending the Mississippi. Another force was to ascend
                    the Mississippi from Louisiana, then ensnare the Chickasaws. In a campaign noted for bad timing and
                    questionable judgments, a portion of the northern arm was smashed by the Chickasaws, resulting in
                    the deaths of François-Marie Bissot de Vincennes, Pierre Groston de St. Ange, and other
                    midwestern Frenchmen.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> At least four members of the Drouet de Richerville
                    family were serving as officers with the destroyed French wing, all of them sons of Claude Drouet de

                    Drouet de Belecart, Louis Drouet de La Gravière, and Denis Drouet de Richerville. Another

            <p>In May, 1764, with the crumbling of the French regime, St. Ange was directed to leave Vincennes to
                    take command at Fort Chartres and deliver that post peacefully to the English. In a proclamation
                    dated May 18 at Vincennes, St. Ange placed that post in the hands jointly of Antoine Drouet de
                    Richerville and Sieur le Caindre. As militia captains, the two were to control drinking, see that
                    fences were maintained, and in general maintain law and order.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Antoine
                    Drouet's leadership was of short duration: he died in Vincennes and was buried on April 15,
                    1765. His death notice in the parish registers refers to "Messire Antoine Drouet de

                    wife.</p>
            <p>During his life in the West Antoine Drouet de Richerville had acquired large landholdings at
                    Vincennes, become an officer of marines, engaged in the trade, and married well. These intermeshed
                    activities were all indicators of frontier success and would continue to be earmarks of the Drouet
                    family for decades.</p>
            <p>By the end of the French regime the Drouet family was scattered throughout central and eastern North
                    America, and more than twenty sons and grandsons of Claude Drouet de Richerville were officers of
                    marines. A Drouet de Surville had led Indian attacks in New York and New Hampshire; a son of Drouet
                    de Carqueville was in several Nova Scotia campaigns in 1758–1759.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>

            <p>Françoise Outelas, widow of Antoine Drouet de Richerville, remained in Vincennes. In
                    January, 1773, she married Ambroise Dageney, a Vincennes merchant. A daughter was born to them early
                    in 1775. By her remarriage and by finding appropriate mates for the Drouet children, she became a
                    leading member of the Vincennes community.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vincennes was a small but important settlement at this time, and most political and military power
                    devolved on three or four families, all allied with the Drouets. The leading personality during the
                    Revolutionary War was François Rider de Bosseron, a merchant, trader, and banker who in
                    1777, while mayor of Vincennes, was elected captain of the local militia. In 1778, with the coming
                    of the American forces under George Rogers Clark, he gave his full support to the expedition,
                    furnished arms and supplies, and actively fought against the British. Later he became a territorial
                    judge. Bosseron died in Vincennes in 1791.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bosseron had long been associated with the Drouet family; in 1775 he was the godfather of the child
                    of the Dageney-Outelas marriage. Around this time Bosseron married Françoise, a daughter
                    of the Drouet-Outelas marriage.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> To cement tighter his relationship to that
                    family, he took into his home the sister and brother of his wife, Marguerite and Antoine Drouet de
                    Richerville. In 1785 Marguerite was married in Vincennes to Paul Gamelin, local merchant of the
                    influential Gamelin family of Detroit.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even after the Revolution Bosseron was usually known as "major of militia." His

                            condescending, biased account of the French. For example, because "Alice"
                            was so good, the author converted her into an adopted child from an aristocratic Virginia

            </p>
            <p> The point is not simply that Bosseron was important, but that he was a link in the closely knit
                    Vincennes socioeconomic structure that hinged on the Drouet de Richerville family. In militia
                    appointments, business affairs, and positions of influence in the church, the names Drouet,
                    Bosseron, and Gamelin predominate, all with a Drouet-by-marriage connection.</p>
            <p>At least one, and possibly two, boys were born to the Drouet-Outelas marriage. Joseph-Antoine Drouet
                    de Richerville was born in Vincennes on January 8, 1759.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p> He was known throughout his life as Antoine Drouet. He and another Richerville, probably a brother,
                    were militia lieutenants in 1779.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p> In that same year Antoine Drouet married Marie Vaudrie of Vincennes, with witnesses Dame
                    Françoise Outelas, François Bosseron, and other local notables.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p> Antoine Drouet had at least three sons by 1784, Antoine, Jean-Baptiste, and Pierre, and the younger
                    Antoine may have figured in some of the land claims after the turn of the century.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is impossible to calculate the extent of the Drouet lands in and around Vincennes. As mentioned
                    earlier, St. Ange in 1754 made a land grant to Antoine Drouet de Richerville. In 1760 St. Ange
                    granted two city lots to Antoine, one on Calvary Street, the other on Street of the Lost.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although St. Ange had all grants notarized, he kept no master register.</p>
            <p>In the early nineteenth century the federal government tried to untangle the many land ownership
                    problems in and around Vincennes. The general policy was to allow ownership to those who could prove
                    possession prior to 1783. Antoine Drouet de Richerville proved ownership of a four hundred acre
                    tract, several smaller unsurveyed tracts, and various city lots.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

            <p>The arrival of large numbers of American settlers quickly diminished the role of the French in the
                    social and economic life of Vincennes. The Drouet de Richerville family remained but did not
                    prosper. To the present day there are hundreds of direct descendants of Antoine Drouet de
                    Richerville in greater Vincennes.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Indiana branch of the Drouet de Richerville family is associated with the history of
                    greater Fort Wayne. From about 1750 to 1770 Joseph Drouet de Richerville traded at what was then the
                    village of Kekionga, also known as Miamitown.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> His full name was Antoine-Joseph
                    Drouet de Richerville, born in 1723, the son of Denis Drouet de Richerville, killed in the Chickasaw
                    campaign of 1736.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Engish officials in Canada were suspicious of those Frenchmen still trading in the West after the
                    Treaty of 1763. Sir Guy Carleton in 1767 listed "Richarville" trading among the
                    Miamis as one who needed watching, as he was trading without the proper license.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Joseph's relationship with Tecumwah, a sister of Miami Chief Little Turtle, led to the birth
                    of a son, Jean-Baptiste, probably in 1761.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> By the late 1780s Joseph seems to
                    have left Indiana permanently to settle in Three Rivers, Quebec. Tecumwah continued to rear
                    Jean-Baptiste after marrying Charles Beaubien, a prominent local French trader.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>

                    Tecumwah. A trader in her own right, she guided young Jean-Baptiste in the intricacies of frontier
                    economics and politics. Jean-Baptiste had a trading post at Miamitown; his mother's post
                    was about twenty-five miles away. Hay noted that "the young man is so very bashful that he
                    never speaks in council, his mother who is very clever is obliged to do it for him." Hay
                    added that "she has been a handsome woman."<hi rend="sup">54</hi> Hay also
                    observed that Jean-Baptiste's father "has wrote for him to go to him which he
                    means [to do] next Spring."<hi rend="sup">55</hi> In other words, Joseph had left the
                    wilderness for Quebec but kept his interest in his son. Young Jean-Baptiste grew up reserved and
                    shy, but he spoke excellent Miami, French, and English. His parents were indeed of the aristocracy
                    of the frontier. His father was of the Drouet de Richerville family, members of the nobility,
                    officers, and traders in New France. Through his mother, Tecumwah, he was nephew of two great Miami
                    chiefs, Little Turtle and Paccan. His shyness would be overcome and within thirty years
                    Jean-Baptiste Richardville was head chief of the Miamis and one of the richest men in the United
                    States.</p>
            <p>Most early accounts attribute Jean-Baptiste's rise to power to an incident in his youth that
                    was stage-managed by Tecumwah. Jean-Baptiste enjoyed telling the tale in later years, though he may
                    have exaggerated. Apparently the Miamis were about to burn a prisoner at the stake. Tecumwah gave
                    her son a knife and told him to "assert his chieftanship by the rescue of the
                    prisoner." The warriors were astonished as Richardville slashed the bonds, but apparently
                    this heroic deed was enough to gain Jean-Baptiste status of chief.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As early as 1795, when he signed the Treaty of Greenville, Jean B. Richardville (as he was then
                    known), was a man to be noticed. Secretary of War Timothy Pickering, in writing of the treaty,
                    mentioned that the accompanying speeches were not interesting: "I may except the speech of
                    Richarville, a Miami chief."<hi rend="sup">57</hi>

            <p>Until Little Turtle's death in 1812, Jean Richardville was almost always at his
                    uncle's side. In 1813 he was elected head chief of the Miamis, a position he held until his
                    death in 1841.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> In the first half of the nineteenth century he was the leading
                    figure in most Indian treaties in Indiana. He was often referred to by his Miami name of Peskawah,
                    "the lynx."</p>
            <p>Richardville became so wealthy that Henry Schoolcraft referred to him as "the most wealthy
                    man of the native race in America." At his death he had more than $200,000 in
                    cash and owned thousands of choice Indiana acres.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> One account mentions his
                    "land and trading posts from Fort Wayne to Kokomo," and notes that "The
                    United States government built for him a brick house on his large estates south of Fort Wayne on the

            </p>
            <p>The treaty at the "Forks of the Wabash" on November 28, 1840, is illustrative of
                    how Richardville operated. By article four, he received $25,000; by article ten, seven
                    sections of land "at such point or points as he may elect …. "<hi rend="sup">61</hi> In the treaties after that of Greenville in 1795, Richardville had been able

                    who became chief of the Miamis after Richardville's death. Another daughter, LaBlonde,

            <p>A full biography of Richardville has yet to be written. It is clear that he was a powerful force
                    among Indians and whites in the Midwest, where he was admired, disparaged, mocked, admonished, and
                    beloved. Such disparate assessments of the man doubtless arose because Richardville presided at the
                    disintegration of Miami culture.</p>
            <p>Contemporary assessments of Richardville vary greatly, even among white chroniclers. Wallace
                    Brice's 1868 account is filled with laudatory phrases: "a most patient
                    listener," "the needy never called in vain," "beloved and
                    esteemed," "prudent and deliberate."<hi rend="sup">64</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most vicious attack in print on Richardville is by William H. Keating, who interviewed him in the
                    early 1820s. Keating lists his "craft and worthlessness," "so much
                    cunning and subtilty." Keating's greatest condemnation, though, must be read to
                    witness a character assassination that yet compels in the modern reader a respect for Richardville:

                            appearance, manners and language, we should never have suspected him to be any other than a
                            Canadian fur-dealer. He is said, however, to possess considerable influence with his tribe.
                            He sometimes assumes the Indian costume, with the exception of the blanket, for which he

                            we had reason to consider him as well entitled to the reputation which he has acquired, of
                            being one of the most artful and deceitful of his nation. He declined meeting the party in
                            conference, stating that the other chiefs of his tribe were absent, and that the
                            circumstance of his holding a conference with white men might expose him to suspicion, which
                            would the more readily attach to him on account of his being himself but a half-breed. This
                            reason was too plausible to allow of our objecting to it; and we regretted that we could not
                            test the sincerity of his offer, to answer all our questions, in a few days, when the other

                    friends. Yet, because he was such a sharp negotiator he was able to arrange good terms for other

            <p>The family of Drouet de Richerville exercised considerable economic and political power in Indiana

                    periods. Their background and training as military men especially equipped them for the frontier.
                    Marriages and family ties enabled them to augment their power and prestige. In Vincennes the
                    family's significance declined in the early nineteenth century when American farmers and
                    merchants culturally overcame the small French population. In greater Fort Wayne the family
                    influence disappeared with the death of Jean Richardville in 1841.</p>
            <p>The Richardvilles were a link, a connection with a past that began with French fur traders in the
                    wilderness. They remained in Indiana, adjusted to successive regimes, and provided a class of

            <p>During the two decades preceeding the Civil War, three important minor parties contested presidential
                    elections in the Midwest. These parties raised issues which the major parties, the Democrats and
                    Whigs, chose to ignore. Two of the minor parties, the Liberty party and the Free Soil party,
                    injected antislaveryism into presidential elections in 1844, 1848, and 1852; the third, the American
                    party, campaigned on nativist principles in 1856. Although the Democrats and Whigs were strongly
                    entrenched in the region, the minor parties exerted significant influence in midwestern politics.
                    Midwesterners played important roles in the development of antislavery doctrines and in the
                    organization of the antislavery parties.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The electorate in the region responded
                    to these efforts by the leaders: from 2.2 percent to 7.6 percent of the estimated eligible
                    electorate in the Midwest voted for the Liberty or Free Soil parties in the presidential elections
                    from 1844 to 1852.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Although the major strength of the nativist Know Nothing
                    movement lay elsewhere, Know Nothing or American party candidates garnered votes from 6.9 percent of

            <p>Political histories have dealt with the nuances of the ideologies propounded by these minor parties,
                    painstakingly traced the maneuverings of the leaders, and offered intriguing explanations for the
                    social, economic, and cultural pressures underlying their appearance. By and large, however, little
                    is known about the place of the minor party in the flow of the vote from one election to another.
                    Did the minor party draw its support disproportionately from one or the other of the major parties,
                    or did it mobilize its voters from among those who hitherto had not voted? And, what choices did
                    these voters make when the third party's organization ultimately collapsed? A close
                    inspection of the midwestern electoral support for these three minor parties helps clarify the role
                    they played in the antebellum electoral system.</p>
            <p>Answering these questions entails following the flow of the minor party vote from one presidential
                    election to another. Ideally, one would wish to employ information regarding the choices made by the
                    individual voters in successive elections and the level of turnout attained by the parties in the
                    geographic units within which the individuals resided. Incorporating both levels of data enables the
                    analysis to gauge the influence of both individual and group level effects on voting for a third
                        party.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Unfortunately, the full array of data required for a multilevel
                    analysis is not available for the antebellum period. The group level voting information is readily
                    found, aggregated at the county level. The deficiency lies in the absence of records indicating the
                    voting choices made by individual voters. A few such records survive in the form of poll books which
                    contain the publicly announced choice of each voter. Voting by ballot superseded viva voce voting,
                    however, and, by the 1840s, the use of poll books was no longer a common practice in the Midwest. As
                    a consequence, an inquiry into the flow of the vote for the midwestern electorate must rest solely
                    upon an examination of the aggregate election data.</p>

                    that a few cases with extraordinary values do not unduly influence the estimates. The actual
                    variables consist of the proportion of the estimated eligible electorate which voted for each
                    party—called party turnout—and the proportion which did not vote in the
                    presidential elections from 1840 to 1860. Party turnout was computed by dividing the number of votes
                    cast for a party by the number of eligible voters estimated to have been living in a county during
                    the election. Public records report the number of ballots cast for each party in an election, but
                    they do not contain a count for the size of the eligible voting population. Consequently, the number
                    of white adult males enumerated by the federal census was used as the estimate for the eligible
                    voting population for the census years, with the number for intercensus years calculated by linear

                    fallacy." The ecological fallacy entails assuming that the zero-order correlation
                    calculated for a distribution of geographic or other units along two variables is an accurate

            <p>An ecological regression, however, cannot obtain separate measures for the aggregate and individual
                    level effects. The individual level effect is the difference in the likelihood of voting for party Y
                    between those who voted for party X in the previous contest and those who did not (the difference
                    between the probabilities X and X in Figure A). The aggregate level effect is the impact of the
                    strength of the vote for party X in a county on the likelihood of voting for party Y in the
                    following campaign. This effect could be positive (Figure A<hi rend="sub">1</hi>), or negative
                    (Figure A<hi rend="sub">2</hi>), or interactive (Figure A<hi rend="sub">3</hi>). The last
                    possibility, interaction, can be tested for by introducing an exponential term into the regression,
                    such as X<hi rend="sup">2</hi> in equation (1). A non-differential aggregate or group level effect,
                    such as those depicted in Figures A<hi rend="sub">1</hi> and A<hi rend="sub">2</hi>, cannot be
                    directly detected by a coefficient in the equation. One can, however, infer the presence of a group
                    level effect when the ecological regression estimates exceed unity—that is, when more
                    than 100 percent of those voting for X are estimated to have also voted for Y in the subsequent
                        election.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> These sorts of statistical evidence provide clues to the

            <p>The ecological regression procedure is not sufficiently refined to estimate the proportion of major
                    party voters subsequently casting minor party ballots. The disparity in the size of major and minor
                    parties is too great to obtain meaningful estimates. Consequently, in order to trace the flow of the
                    vote between major and minor parties, the analysis correlates the change in turnout for a major
                    party between two elections with the change in minor party turnout. The rationale for this approach
                    lies in the expectation that the defection experienced by a major party would appear as a decline in
                    its turnout recorded for the county from the first election to the second, while the <list type="footnotes">

                    minor party. The greater the number who defected, the greater the decline observed for the major
                    party and, conversely, the greater the increment observed for the minor party. This pattern in
                    statistical terms would produce a negative correlation.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> The opposite
                    statistical association applies for assessing whether non-voters in an earlier election voted for
                    the minor party. In this case, the greater the number of previous abstainers who cast minor party
                    ballots in an election, the greater the increase in the third party vote. This situation
                    statistically results in a positive correlation. Of course, the ebbs and swirls within the flow of
                    voters among the parties from one election to another ensure that a perfect one-for-one voter shift
                    does not emerge in the turnout patterns. However, this approach does provide an empirical basis for
                    assessing whether Democrats, Whigs, or abstainers were the voter reservoirs for the minor
                    party's electoral support.</p>
            <p>Once the groups from which the minor party drew support have been identified, then causal models can
                    be used to gauge the relative importance of these groups in the minor party's electoral
                    coalition. Because of the obvious interrelationship between a change in the turnout recorded for the
                    major parties and the change in total turnout, the elegant four variable recursive causal model
                    containing variables measuring the change in the two major parties and the change in total turnout
                    cannot be used in the analysis.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Instead, the inquiry employs three variable
                    causal models which are applied in separate steps in order to assess the relative importance of the

                    variable, which is the phenomenon to be explained, is the change in turnout estimated for the minor
                    party. The two variables incorporated in the model as predictor variables are the change in the
                    turnout for one of the major parties and the change in total turnout. Standard least-squares

            <p>The inquiry utilizes these statistical models to analyze county level party turnout in order to
                    observe the flow of the vote to and from minor parties. The study focuses first on the Liberty
                    party, then turns to examine the Free Soil party, and concludes by considering the American party.
                    For each of these minor parties, the analysis seeks to identify the electoral origins of those who
                    voted for the minor party and, upon the disappearance of that political institution, to discern the
                    subsequent electoral choices made by the minor party voters.</p>
            <p>In the late 1830s, an increasingly well organized and active movement worked tirelessly for the
                    abolition of slavery within the United States. By inundating Congress with antislavery petitions and
                    by propagandizing the public through the press and the pulpit on the evils of slavery, the
                    abolitionists sought to pressure the national government into withdrawing federal support for the
                    South's peculiar institution. Some abolitionists believed that direct political action was
                    required and that an antislavery political party should contest the 1840 presidential election
                    against the two major parties, the Whig and the Democrat. James G. Birney, a prominent abolitionist
                    and former slaveholder, agreed to head the ticket of the newly formed Liberty party.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Liberty party effort was not a success: Birney spent the campaigning season in England; many
                    abolitionists opposed an antislavery political party; and the party organization necessary for
                    distributing ballots and producing voters was woefully scant. The Liberty party received only 1,062

                            gauge the flow of the vote among the parties from one election to another violates the
                            assumption that the population was closed. The composition of the electorate doubtlessly
                            changed from one election to another because of mortality, migration, and maturation. This
                            introduces random variation into the bi-variate distributions for the party turnout levels.
                            With regard to the ecological regression analysis, the effects of this artifactual variation
                            is to bias the intercept toward the mean party turnout computed for the set of counties and
                            to bias the ecological regression coefficient toward zero. With respect to the causal
                            models, the random variance would tend to lower the correlation between the change
                            variables. The presence of this conservative bias in the estimates serves to increase the
                            confidence one might take in any differences that emerge from the analysis.</item>

                    party's fortunes improved in the following off-year contests, and in the 1844 presidential
                    election 17,261 midwesterners cast their ballots for Birney. In 1846, the Liberty party more than
                    equalled its 1844 tally, but it did not survive to contest the 1848 election. The brief, tempestuous
                    life of the Liberty party terminated in the conventions which led to the organization of the Free
                    Soil party in the summer of 1848.</p>
            <p>What were the political origins of the Liberty party voters? Contemporaries, particularly Whig
                    politicians and editors, maintained that Liberty voters were Whig defectors. During and after the
                    campaign in 1844, Whig spokesmen bitterly denounced the Liberty men for bringing about the defeat of
                    their candidate, Henry Clay. This view appears in the historical literature as well.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> To corroborate the contention that the bulk of the Liberty voters were former Whigs,
                    historians point to the Whiggish background of many Liberty party leaders, to the efforts made by
                    Whig politicians to lure Liberty people to their standard, to the presence of non-Liberty
                    abolitionists in the Whig ranks, and to the vitriol in the Whig attacks on the Liberty men. This
                    interpretation is congenial to the notion that the Whig party suffered from a lack of cohesion,
                    perhaps an excess of anti-party sentiment; it views the defection of Liberty men as the first phase
                    of the fragmentation of the Whig party.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Yet the Liberty party also possessed a
                    potential appeal to antislavery Democrats.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> And it is possible that the
                    moralistic antislavery crusade drew into the political world men who were previously inactive in
                    politics—men who were indifferent to the issue dimensions defining the Whig-Democrat
                    conflict and had therefore abstained in 1840. The Liberty party, then, might have been a more
                    heterogeneous group than many scholars have suggested.</p>

               </table> 1840, then one would expect a positive correlation between the change in party turnout
                    (1840–1844) and the Liberty turnout. Conversely, if the Liberty support stemmed largely
                    from among those who did not vote in 1840, then one would expect a negative association between
                    change in total turnout and the 1844 Liberty turnout. The zero-order correlation coefficients
                    presented in Table I show a mild positive association between both the change in Democratic turnout
                    and the change in Whig turnout and the Liberty party turnout. These correlations suggest that people
                    voting Democrat and Whig in 1840 moved into the Liberty ranks in 1844. The zero-order coefficient
                    for change in total turnout and Liberty party turnout is positive, which does not support the
                    hypothesis that many 1840 non-voters turned out for Birney in 1844.</p>
            <p>Not surprisingly, however, each of the changes in major party turnout variables correlates well (at
                    the 0.80 level) with the change in turnout variable. Moreover, the party turnout variables correlate
                    positively with each other at the 0.40 level. <pb n="126" id="VAA4025-074-2-028"/> This pattern of
                    intercorrelation raises the possibility that the zero-order correlations are not accurately
                    measuring the independent association between each change variable and Liberty party turnout.
                    Consequently, the inquiry must incorporate multivariate statistical models in order to measure the
                    correlation between a change variable and Liberty party turnout with the effects of the other change
                    variables controlled. For reasons discussed above, the analysis employs a series of three-variable
                    causal models in order to test for the independent correlation between the change variables and
                    Liberty party turnout. If a major party turnout variable is indeed independently correlated with the
                    Liberty vote, then the partial correlation coefficient between it and Liberty turnout, controlling
                    for the change variable for the other major party, should remain positive and retain a non-trivial
                    level of magnitude. Similarly, if the change in turnout actually is negatively associated with the
                    strength of the Liberty party in 1844, then the three-variable statistical model should produce
                    negative partial correlation coefficients when the change in party turnout is controlled.</p>
            <p>The partial coefficients presented in Table I conform to the pattern expected if the Liberty party
                    voters stemmed not only from 1840 Whigs but also from 1840 Democrats and non-voters. The first
                    partial coefficient measures the independent association between the Liberty turnout and the change
                    in Democratic turnout, with the change in Whig turnout controlled. The partial coefficient indicates
                    a much weaker covariation between change in Democratic turnout and Liberty turnout than the
                    zero-order coefficient implied; yet, the faint positive association suggests that a relatively
                    modest number of 1840 Democratic voters supported Birney in 1844. The evidence pointing to a flow of
                    1840 Whigs and non-voters into the Liberty ranks in 1844 is much stronger. When the change in
                    Democratic turnout is controlled, the correlation between the change in Whig turnout and Liberty
                    turnout exceeds the zero-order correlation. The findings for the change in total turnout variable
                    are even more striking. When the party turnout variables are controlled, the correlation between
                    change in turnout and Liberty turnout changes in sign from positive to negative and attains
                    non-trivial levels of magnitude. These negative partial correlations support the notion that many
                    1840 non-voters turned out in 1844 to vote for the Liberty party. The multivariate analysis, then,
                    suggests that in 1844 the Liberty party drew some support from 1840 Democratic voters and
                    significant support from 1840 Whig voters and 1840 non-voters.</p>

            <p>The people from these varied political backgrounds who supported the Liberty party apparently voted
                    for it regularly. Several characteristics of the turnout for the party point to this conclusion. The
                    Liberty party vote tended to be concentrated in a limited number of counties. For example, only
                    seventy of the 282 counties (28 percent) surpassed the 1843 mean turnout level of 1 percent in the
                    off-year elections; ninety-four (33 percent) surpassed the 1844 mean turnout level of 2 percent; and
                    105 (37 percent) surpassed the 1846 mean turnout level of 2 percent. Moreover, the same counties
                    were generally producing the higher turnout rates for the Liberty party; the zero-order correlation
                    between Liberty party turnout for 1843 and 1844 was 0.68 and for 1844 and 1846 it was 0.88. The
                    probability that an 1844 Liberty man again cast a Liberty ballot in 1846 estimated by the ecological
                    regression exceeds 1.00. This, of course, is an inadmissable estimate, which suggests the presence
                    of an aggregate level effect. The analysis testing for an interaction form of this effect
                    (illustrated by Figure A<hi rend="sub">3</hi>) produced trivial coefficients indicating that a group
                    level effect (illustrated by Figure A<hi rend="sub">1</hi>) produced the inadmissable estimate. The
                    magnitude of the group effect cannot be measured, but evidently both Liberty voters and those not
                    casting Liberty ballots in 1844 were more likely to vote Liberty in 1846 in those counties where the
                    Liberty party drew well in 1844. This inference again points to the concentrated nature of Liberty
                    voting. Liberty men apparently remained steadfast in making a political expression of their
                    antislavery views, and their presence apparently conditioned others to do so as well.</p>
            <p>In 1848, a new third party campaigned against extending slavery into the territories won in the
                    Mexican War. The leaders of the Free Soil party came from various political backgrounds: prominent
                    Liberty men such as Salmon P. Chase; Conscience Whigs like Charles Francis Adams, the
                    party's vice-presidential nominee; and disgruntled Democrats such as Martin Van Buren, the
                    party's presidential nominee. The Free Soilers united on the antislavery expansion
                    principle expressed in the Wilmot Proviso in order to combat the dominant influence exercised by
                    southern politicians in the national government.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Although an uneasy alliance

                    support registered for the Liberty party in earlier elections. The Free Soil tide ebbed rapidly
                    after the election. Throughout the North, many of the party's political leadership made
                    accommodations for themselves with either of the two major parties and abandoned the Free Soil
                    party. In 1852, 55,618 midwesterners voted for John P. Hale, the Free Soil party's last
                    presidential candidate.</p>
            <p>In looking for electoral groups who might have voted Free Soil in 1848, the obvious one to consider
                    is the Liberty men. Although the Free Soil party resolutely avoided associating itself with
                    abolitionism, the party's platform did express opposition to extending slavery into the
                    territories and called for prohibiting slavery in the District of Columbia. The rank and file
                    Liberty men apparently recognized the Free Soil party as a legitimate antislavery political
                    organization because the evidence suggests that they followed their leaders into the new party. The
                    correlation between the 1844 Liberty party turnout and the 1848 Free Soil turnout is 0.81,
                    indicating that the strong Liberty counties were also strong Free Soil counties. A sense of the
                    relationship between the Liberty and Free Soil parties is provided by the ecological regression
                    estimates for the probability that an 1844 Liberty voter would also cast a Free Soil ballot in 1848.
                    The estimate exceeds 1.00, which suggests the presence of either group level (illustrated by Figure
                        A<hi rend="sub">1</hi>) or interactive (illustrated by Figure A<hi rend="sub">3</hi>) effects. A
                    polynomial regression testing for the presence of interaction produced trivial coefficients for the
                    interaction term, which suggests that a group level effect contributed to the excessive estimate.
                    That is, Liberty men apparently were quite likely to vote for the Free Soil ticket in 1848, but, in
                    addition, the probability that they and non-Liberty people would do so increased with the strength
                    of the 1844 Liberty vote in their county.</p>
            <p>Who were the non-Liberty men turning out for the Free Soil party in 1848? The historical literature
                    typically points to a substantial movement of Whig voters into the Free Soil ranks. Moreover, recent
                    studies of the Free Soil party contend that a significant number of antislavery Democrats also voted
                    for Van Buren.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Although generally ignored in historical accounts, non-voters

                    with the change in the Democratic and Whig parties' turnout and with the change in total

                    to the Free Soil banner in 1848, then the change in Whig or Democratic party turnout variables
                    should correlate negatively with the change in the Liberty and Free Soil vote variable. On the other
                    hand, if large numbers of 1844 non-voters cast Free Soil ballots in 1848, then the change in total

                    important Whig component in the surge in antislavery support.</p>
            <p>However, the zero-order coefficients are to a considerable degree deceptive. The partial correlation
                    coefficients in Table II indicate that, when the change in Democrat turnout is controlled, the
                    change in Whig turnout retains its moderate negative association with the antislavery increase. On
                    the other hand, controlling the change in Whig turnout sharply reduces the association between
                    change in Democratic turnout and the change in the antislavery vote to a trivial level. Apparently,
                    only an insignificant number of 1844 Democratic voters turned out for the Free Soil party in 1848 in
                    the Midwest. The partial correlation coefficients between change in total turnout and the change in
                    antislavery turnout with the Democrat and Whig variables controlled both markedly exceed the
                    zero-order coefficient. This sharp increase indicates that the changes in party turnout variables

               </table> turnout variables were masking an important independent association between change in total
                    turnout and the change in the antislavery turnout. This evidence suggests that the major elements in
                    the surge in antislavery turnout between 1844 and 1848 consisted of people who either voted Whig or
                    did not vote in 1844.</p>
            <p>In 1852, the Free Soil electoral strength waned. Free Soil turnout in the four midwestern states
                    declined from 7.6 percent in 1848 to 5.1 percent. The correlation coefficients presented in Table
                    III suggest the character of the political choices made in 1852 by those who left the Free Soil
                    ranks. If 1848 Free Soil voters tended to vote for one of the major parties in 1852, then one would
                    expect a negative correlation between the change in the Free Soil turnout and the change in party
                    turnout variables. Additionally, if 1848 Free Soil voters withdrew from politics in 1852 and
                    abstained, then one would expect a positive correlation between the Free Soil change variable and
                    the change in total turnout. The zero-order coefficients indicate only a negligible association
                    between the difference in Free Soil turnout and the change in Democrat turnout, but a stronger
                    association between it and the Whig and the total turnout variables. Moreover, the negative
                    correlation computed for change in Whig turnout and the positive correlation computed for change in
                    total turnout conforms to the predicted directions. As the table shows, these relationships hold for
                    the partial correlation coefficients, too. Apparently, the 1848 Free Soilers who did not support the
                    party four years later either cast a Whig ballot or abstained in 1852.</p>
            <pb n="132" id="VAA4025-074-2-034"/>
            <p>Most of the 1852 Free Soil voters evidently came from those who supported the party in 1848.
                    According to the estimates produced by ecological regression, 60 percent of the 1848 Free Soilers
                    voted for the party again in 1852. Who were those faithful Free Soilers? Apparently, many of them
                    were the Liberty men. There is a strong correlation between Liberty turnout in 1844 and 1852 Free
                    Soil turnout (0.73), indicating that the two parties tended to draw their strength from the same
                    counties. The ecological regression estimate for the proportion of 1844 Liberty men voting Free Soil
                    in 1852 exceeds 100 percent, which points to the presence of group or interactive effects on 1852
                    Free Soil voting. The subsequent analysis suggested that group effects rather than interaction
                    contributed to the inadmissable estimate. A persuasive explanation for this finding is that the 1844
                    Liberty men, joined by others in the counties in which Liberty voters were numerous relative to
                    elsewhere, were the heart of the Free Soil support in both 1848 and 1852. When the Republican party
                    campaigned against the expansion of slavery in 1856, virtually all 1852 Free Soilers turned out to
                    cast their ballots for Republican candidate John C. Fremont.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>The vote in 1856 was complicated by the fact that nativism in the form of the American party burst
                    upon the political scene. As a suspicious and hostile orientation toward immigrants, nativism had
                    long been present in American culture, manifesting itself in suffrage restrictions, discrimination,
                    and riots. During the antebellum period, the nativist impulse also figured in local politics in such
                    efforts as preventing parochial schools from benefitting from public tax revenue and closing beer
                    gardens on Sunday.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> As the Whig party collapsed, in the early 1850s, many
                    politicians sought to mobilize an opposition to the Democracy around such nativist causes as
                    restricting public office to the native born and tightening the immigration laws. Coming together as
                    the American party, these nativist forces nominated Millard Fillmore for the presidency in 1856.
                    Although Fillmore received ballots from 89,781 voters within the four midwestern states, the
                    American party faded rapidly after 1856 and did not contest the 1860 presidential election in the
                    region.</p>

                    1852 Whig voters were indeed more likely than most to cast a nativist ballot in 1856. As Table IV
                    indicates, an estimated 21.5 percent of those voting for Whig candidates in 1852 also voted for
                    Fillmore four years later. Michael F. Holt's recent study of the Know Nothings suggests
                    that the impatient political climate of the 1850s also led many Democrats to support the American
                    party: "When both the Democrats and Whigs courted these [immigrant and Catholic] groups
                    rather than redressing the Protestants' grievances, voters bolted to the Know Nothing order
                    which promised that it would jettison the unresponsive political power-brokers who ran the major
                    parties …. "<hi rend="sup">22</hi> However, the evidence in Table IV suggests
                    that very few Democrats in the Midwest voted for the Know Nothings. The estimates do suggest that
                    the American party drew substantially from among those who did not vote in 1852. An estimated 21.7
                    percent of the 1852 non-voters cast American party ballots in 1856. Table V shows that the
                    midwestern Know Nothings, upon the collapse of their national party in 1860, tended to move into the
                    Republican ranks. An estimated 64.7 percent of them voted for Lincoln in the 1860 election.</p>
            <p>The minor parties in the antebellum Midwest held several characteristics in common. The leaders

                    expansion; and the American party vigorously propounded nativism. This approach succeeded in
                    attracting support from people who, although relatively modest in numbers, voted rather consistently
                    for their minor party. Supporters of the earliest of these minor parties, the Liberty party,
                    evidently steadfastly voted for antislavery candidates, even later when they ran as Free Soil-ers
                    and Republicans. Those joining with the Libertymen under the Free Soil banner in 1848 were also
                    likely to cast Free Soil and then Republican ballots in subsequent elections. The American party
                    campaigned for the presidency only once in the Midwest, but those voting Know Nothing in 1856 moved
                    largely as a group to the Republicans in 1860.</p>
            <p>A major feature of political life in the 1840s and 1850s was the capacity for the minor parties to
                    mobilize support among voters who had not participated in the preceeding presidential election and
                    from those who had cast Whig ballots. The Liberty party evidently drew largely from the Whig ranks
                    and the abstainers, although some of its initial support stemmed from Democratic voters. Similarly,
                    the Free Soil party in 1848 and also the American party in 1856 apparently benefitted from those
                    voting Whig or not voting in the preceeding contest. Finally, these groups of former Whig voters and
                    non-voters who supported the Free Soil and American parties ultimately found a place in the
                    Republican electoral coalition.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

            <p>During the intensely nationalistic era that followed the War of 1812, even the most remote frontier
                    area found time to nurture its patriotism on the Fourth of July. This was the case in 1821 in
                    Hindostan, an Indiana pioneer community located on the east fork of the White River near present day
                    Shoals in Martin County. Founded in 1819, the settlement flourished briefly but was stricken by a
                    "great sickness" which led to its demise by 1828. The Independence Day oration
                    printed below is one of the few surviving documents of its brief existence.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>The orator was one of the town's first doctors, Malthus A. Ward. Born into a destitute farm
                    family in Haverhill, New Hampshire, in 1794, Ward somehow managed to attend the local academy, take
                    classes at Middlebury College in Vermont, apprentice himself to a physician, and complete a course
                    of lectures at the Medical Institution at Dartmouth. Because of a surplus of practitioners in New
                    England, the hope of undertaking his chosen profession near home was not promising. In 1815,
                    therefore, he departed for the West. Failing to establish a practice in New York, he settled in
                    western Pennsylvania, first at Kittanning and later at Pittsburgh.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During his stay in Pennsylvania, Ward considered the possibility of moving on to Ohio or Indiana. He
                    was reluctant to do so, however, because of the lack of reliable information. He was scornful of
                    newspaper accounts and published letters from "<hi rend="i">uninterested</hi> gentlemen to
                    their eastern friends" which he viewed as the "production of crafty land
                    speculators and others possessing large tracts in the vicinity of the places they
                    eulogize." "Success in Ohio or Indiana," he felt, "would depend
                    upon being at hand to seize the fortunate moment of occupying the place of some eminent practitioner
                    just dead or removed from the country."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Hindostan must have appealed
                    to Dr. Ward as a tempting prospect, for it was a growing village in need of doctors. His source of
                    information about Hindostan was probably Josiah Doane, an early resident who had migrated from
                    Pittsburgh where his brother Henry and Ward were fellow Masons. When Ward arrived in 1819, he was a
                    unique settler because he planned to remain only long enough to further his "pecuniary
                    interests." He wanted to make sufficient money to enable him to return to his native New
                    England, finish his medical education, and pursue a lucrative and successful career in the more
                    congenial atmosphere of the East. <hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>Ward was a prolific writer, and his long and meticulous letters from western Pennsylvania provide a
                    vivid picture of frontier medicine and society. Unfortunately, a careful search of the Library of
                    Congress and other depositories where his correspondence is located failed to reveal any letters
                    written from Hindostan. After returning to New England in 1823, he earned an M.D. degree at the
                    Medical College of Maine and began practice at Salem, Massachusetts, where he became a prominent
                    civic leader.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> There he inserted into a volume, bound by the city Athenaeum and

            <p>Ward's speech is important as it relates to the history of printing in Indiana. The copy in
                    the Salem Athenaeum is apparently the only one extant. It is not recorded by the compilers of
                    Indiana imprints, and its printer, Blackman of Vincennes, is not listed among the publishers of the
                    state. Only ninety-one items listed in published bibliographies of Indiana imprints bear an earlier
                    publication date. Moreover, most of the imprints prior to 1821 are government documents, political
                    and business announcements, and religious and fraternal literature. Ward's oration is one
                    of the few early publications which reflects something of the social and economic concerns of the
                        day.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The speech is typical of Independence Day orations of the period. Mirroring the prevailing
                    nationalistic spirit of the early 1820s, Ward's patriotic fervor was unbounded. He compared
                    the young Republic's past and future to the triumphs of Rome and Greece and lauded the
                    Declaration of Independence and Constitution as the "fountain" from which the
                    nation's "prosperity and happiness calmly, but continually flows." He
                    devoted considerable time to the country's military history, particularly the
                    "heroic achievements" of the War of 1812, which "evinced the ability of
                    our government to defend itself against foreign aggression, and to retort upon the proud oppressor
                    his contumely and wrongs …. " Having won respect from abroad and isolation from

                    in a period of unprecendented tranquility. In this domestic political "Era of Good
                    Feelings," Ward attributed the apparent lack of partisanship to the "conciliatory
                    spirit and amiability" of President James Monroe as well as to the "diffusion of
                    literature and useful knowledge amongst us." Even the "uncommon hardness of the
                    times" resulting from the Panic of 1819 did not dim Ward's roseate forecast. An
                    invaluable role would continue to be played by pioneer women, not only as mothers but as
                    contributors in "turning a desert into a garden …. " Ward saved his
                    final hosanna for the symbol of the country's past and future greatness, George Washington.</p>
            <p>The document is also of interest regarding the history of Hindostan. Ward's reference to the
                    "ravages of that dreadful mortality" during the previous year substantiates other
                    sources that a "strange plague" brought about the town's ultimate
                    collapse. Echoing contemporary medical theory, he blamed the "nauseous swamps" of
                    the vicinity for having caused the "pestilence and death." Anticipating an
                    abundant harvest, he congratulated the citizens on the "encouraging … prospects
                    before you." His hopes were in vain. Perhaps less than one half of the peak population of
                    five hundred remained by 1824. After Ward's removal, there was no resident doctor to care
                    for those stricken with disease, and by 1828 the site was virtually abandoned. Hindostan was not to
                    share in the future growth of the state and nation as Ward had predicted in his speech of July 4,
                        1821.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

                        had not "all fled the town in fear of their lives" but rather that the decline
                        of Hindostan was a gradual process culminating in the transfer of the county seat to Mt.

            <p>FELLOW CITIZENS,</p>
            <p>There is no country that has not cherished the commemorative celebration of important events in its
                    history. It is the spontaneous dictate of public feeling. It is native love for ourselves carried
                    back to those who have gone before us, and denotes our pride and our gratitude. Religion has thrown
                    its consecrated mantle over this custom: Indeed, it was in the service of religion that it had its
                    origin; and there is no sect of its professors, whether Christian, Mahometan or Pagan, which does
                    not observe with punctilious regard, and ostentatious ceremonies, the annual return of certain
                    festivals. This usage was at length extended to remarkably happy political epochs, and at last even
                    to matters of mere individual concern, such as marriages, birth days, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Of its propriety and utility there can be no doubt. Had Greece thrown a veil over each transaction as
                    it transpired, posterity might have admired some short gleams of lustre, insulated stars in her vast
                    horizon, but we should have looked in vain for the galaxy of glory, which made her the mistress of
                    the world while she existed, and commands the homage of the world now that she has ceased to exist.</p>
            <p>When Rome enlisted in her service the same energies that had made Greece immortal, her most efficient
                    engine on the present generation, was to present to it the mirror of the past—The
                    conqueror claimed his ovation and triumph, and his country gave a new existence to his glory, by
                    celebrating its annual return.</p>
            <p>It was natural and honorable that such a country as ours should follow these brillant examples. Bound
                    together as we are, by common will, and not by force, and relying solely, as we do, for the
                    overcoming of assaults, by drafts on individual patriotism, we cement our union by the celebration
                    of a glorious achievement, the common property of us all, and repay patriotism by its best means of
                    gratitude.</p>
            <p>In compliance with a custom thus sanctioned by our predecessors, and salutary to ourselves, have we
                    this day assembled. It is a meeting fraught with the most interesting recollections, with the most
                    powerful emotions. We have not come together, in compliance with an arbitrary command, to hallow the
                    native day of a prince, perchance a tyrant, who came into the world merely in conformity to the same
                    law of nature which produces a peasant,—to assume the outward appearances of gladness
                    while our hearts are sad, and smile upon our chains while we feel their galling ignominy; but we
                    have voluntarily followed <pb n="140" id="VAA4025-074-2-042"/> the spontaneous impulse of our
                    hearts, and joyfully united to hail the nativity of a free, a powerful, and happy people, the
                    emersion from the waters of oppression, of our extensive and delightful land, where Liberty could
                    take up her undisturbed abode, and dispense her rich blessings to millions of happy
                    intelligences—in a word, to celebrate the BIRTH DAY OF OUR NATION!</p>
            <p>Forty five years have rolled away since that momentous event, and never has its anniversary returned,
                    whether in the bright sunshine of prosperous peace, or in the gloomy hour of perilous war, but it
                    has been greeted with joyful acclamations; and at each successive return have its blessings been
                    commemorated with undiminished fervour, and by increasing numbers of happy freemen. No longer
                    confined to the borders of the Atlantic, the seat of its birth, the voice of freedom is responded
                    from the West—where late the savage occupant of this extensive region fixed his
                    precarious abode, or prowled abroad in all the ferocity of his native wildness. Throughout this
                    immense expanse, wherever the Genius of our Republick extends her protecting wings, are all hearts
                    inspired, and all voices raised on this mighty theme.</p>
            <p>Our Independence has been a subject so fruitful of comment, and a topic so often and so ably
                    expounded, that in the few remarks I have to make, it will hardly be supposed that I can pretend to
                    much originality: I however, freely trust myself to your candour and liberality, in full confidence
                    that you will accept my sincerity and zeal in compensation for my deficiency in elegant of diction
                    and brilliancy of style.—</p>
            <p>The document which has just been read to you in so feeling and handsome manner, pronounced us
                        "<hi rend="i">a free and sovereign people.</hi>" "There is probably
                    no state paper, of equal conciseness, in the records of empires, that declares in such energy of
                    language, such purity of composition, and felicity of expression, the great and unalienable rights
                    of our nature."—"In the whole course of our historical reading, and
                    indeed throughout the variety of governments which the ingenuity of man has instituted for
                    ameliorating the social condition of the human race, we find no instance combining such
                    excellencies, and distributing so many benefits, as that production of wisdom, the Constitution of
                    these States."—I have chosen this eulogy on the declaration of our rights and
                    the Grand Charter of our liberties, because in estimating the favoured privileges and immunities we
                    enjoy as freemen, these documents naturally present themselves as the fountain whence this stream of
                    prosperity and <pb n="141" id="VAA4025-074-2-043"/> happiness calmly, but continually
                    flows:—and in so doing I have adopted the sentiments and language of a distinguished
                    ornament of our country, whose learning and judgment, equally profound, add weight to his opinion,
                    and ought, if possible, to increase our veneration for those admirable instruments—to
                    enhance the value of their possession, and strengthen the determination to preserve them.</p>
            <p>"We declare that we are, and of right ought to be, a free, sovereign, and independent
                    nation."—Who, with such a text, can be at a loss for something to say? and even
                    if it should be but a bare repetition of what has been said a thousand times before, who, that is an
                    American, can be tired of so grateful a topic as the independence of his country?—Save
                    only the Being and attributes of the Deity, and the Immortality of our own souls, a more sublime,
                    interesting, and inexhaustible subject cannot occupy the human mind, nor can there be a time better
                    adapted to call forth all its powers than the present occasion.</p>

                    grand events of our revolutionary struggle by which it was, I trust, perpetually secured to us, or
                    the enviable state of prosperity and peace we enjoyed after its close—hoping to keep
                    aloof from the troubles and commotions of the nations of Europe. You know also how that hope was

                    secured by justice, nor safety the result of unmolesting forbearance." Goaded by contumely
                    and wrongs, the injuries of one nation making the arguments and excuse for those of the other, this
                    country was again compelled to embark upon the tempestuous ocean of war, and with manly firmness to
                    demand by force that redress which was denied to justice. How that war was conducted—what
                    vicissitudes we encountered—how the ancient American spirit animated our breasts and
                    nerved our arms, and how successfully it terminated, are facts of recent occurrence, and known to

            <p>The names of those gallant spirits who covered themselves with a shroud of glory in those terrific
                    conflicts, as well as of the scenes of their heroic achievements have been given to the voice of
                    fame—have been registered on the tablet of historic renown. We should ever cherish them
                    in our hearts, but by making them too familiar on our tongues, we in some measure detract from their
                    sanctity of character, and weaken that effect which they might otherwise produce, when the time of
                    need should come for such powerful auxiliaries. Should ever the dark cloud of war and peril again

                    patriotic spirit in every breast, and stimulate to deeds of highest enterprise; and the recital of
                    the exploits of DECATUR and HULL, of PERRY and M'DONOUGH, would be the most efficient means
                    of ensuring a repetition of their triumphs.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Romans</hi> had a maxim that the assistance of a god should never be invoked, but on
                    occasions worthy the interference of a god; and in these times of peace and tranquility it is,
                    perhaps, best to let our martial ardour, and the more turbulent of our patriotic emotions remain in
                    quiet repose, and thus gain new strength against the hour of needful exertion. Let us rather indulge
                    those sympathies, equally patriotic and dear to the sensitive heart, which invite us to wreathe with
                    laurel and cypress the tombs of WARREN and MONTGOMERY and PIKE; and to pour the tear of grateful
                    remembrance on the cold urns of LAWRENCE and BURROWS. War, cruel, bloody, iron-hearted war, however
                    splendid in its career, or fortunate in its termination, is always fruitful in distress, and justly
                    denominated the most dreadful scourge of nations—The last one, though comparatively short
                    and confessedly glorious, cost our nation a hundred millions of money, and covered a hundred <pb n="143" id="VAA4025-074-2-045"/> thousand of our citizens with weeds of mourning and grief for
                    the loss of friends and brothers, and husbands and fathers, slain or destroyed by hardship and
                    disease.</p>
            <p>While thus contemplating the tremendous price at which our liberties have been purchased and
                    maintained, how feelingly ought we to appreciate the blessings of the peace we enjoy!—how
                    ought we to thank and support that government which has secured it to us!—Happy at home
                    and respected abroad—too powerful to invite, and too noble to inflict
                    injury—our friendship, once spurned, is now eagerly sought by all the nations of the
                    earth. Having evinced the ability of our government to defend itself against foreign aggression, and
                    to retort upon the proud oppressor his contumely and wrongs—having proven that our
                    friendship is as much to be desired as our enmity is to be dreaded, we may confidently hope to
                    escape in future the destructive vortex into which other nations may be drawn:—And, to
                    crown all, I believe there never was a time when we have had so little to apprehend from internal
                    commotion. There has been no period in the annals of our politics, which has evinced so much unity
                    of feeling, and been so productive of harmony and mutual forgiveness, as that which has
                    characterized the present administration of our government. A great deal of this good temper is no
                    doubt the effect of the well known conciliatory spirit and amiability of manner of our worthy chief
                    magistrate; but at the same time, this olive branch, which so happily shows itself throughout the
                    union, is, in a great degree, attributable to the more extended diffusion of literature and useful
                    knowledge amongst us—enlightening, expanding, and liberalizing the public mind, thereby
                    hastening its gradual march towards a true sense of the benefits our happy constitution affords, and
                    the ability and impartiality with which its provisions are dispensed.</p>
            <p>MY FRIENDS,—as citizens of the United States, permit me most heartily to congratulate you
                    that these things are so; and to wish you many opportunities of celebrating the 4th of July. As
                    citizens of Indiana, I congratulate you, that notwithstanding the embarrassment under which we
                    labour from the general depression of business and uncommon hardness of the times, our State is
                    rapidly increasing in population, in wealth and in public importance. As citizens of Martin County,
                    I congratulate you on the encouraging aspect of the prospect before you. Hitherto a great degree of
                    healthiness has prevailed. The general progress of the season has been favorable, and the present
                    flourishing state of vegetation promises, not only an abundant harvest to the husbandman, the rich
                    reward of his <pb n="144" id="VAA4025-074-2-046"/> toil, but seems to impart an earnest assurance
                    that you will not be again exposed to the ravages of that dreadful mortality, which within the past
                    year, has made such desolation in your houses, and in your bosoms.—The goodly number who
                    are here assembled to greet each other on this joyful anniversary, and to sit down in friendship and
                    harmony at the same festive board, is a spectacle which must be highly grateful to the genius of
                    neighborly love and social order. The spirit with which you have come forward to celebrate the day,
                    evinces that the cause of Independence and Liberty is still dear to your bosoms, and that you intend
                    to impress upon the minds of the rising generation the high value you set on those privileges, which
                    you are resolved to transmit to them. You behold in each other, those on whose industry and
                    perseverance you repose your hopes of seeing, within a few years, a fair and fertile portion of the
                    state rescued from the condition of a dreary wilderness, where nothing was formerly heard but the
                    howling of the wolf—where no living creature cheered the eye, except, perchance, a
                    bounding deer, a rude bear, or a ruthless savage;—men, who will convert the gloomy woods
                    into fields waving with luxuriant harvests, and change the nauseous swamps, emitting pestilence and
                    death, into rich meadows clothed with thick and verdant herbage.</p>
            <p>In deeds like these consists the purest patriotism. However the sense of the term may have been
                    changed by the corrupt and unwarrantable uses to which it has too often been applied, the word <hi rend="i">patriot</hi> simply means <hi rend="i">a man who loves his country.</hi> Now I contend
                    that the man, who, with a liberal regard to the interest of his neighbors, and a spirit to maintain
                    the sacred principles of the rights of man, expends the energies of his mind and body in these
                    simple employments, thereby enriching his country as well as himself, is as truly a <hi rend="i">patriot</hi>, and as well entitled to the applause of the world, as he who by his eloquence
                    supports the people's cause in the senate, or by his valour defends it in the
                    field—And I have the authority of the celebrated Dean Swift for saying that "He
                    who makes two ears of corn, or two blades of grass grow upon the spot where but one grew before,
                    deserves better of his country than the whole race of politicians put together."</p>
            <p>There is still one more subject for pleasing congratulation—the number and respectability
                    of the females who have honoured our meeting with their presence and polite
                    attention—many of them have left the comforts and elegancies of refined
                    life—have bade adieu to their relations, their early companions, and the scenes of their
                    youth, endeared by a thousand <pb n="145" id="VAA4025-074-2-047"/> tender
                    recollections—rupturing the ligaments of many a heart-woven attachment, to accompany you
                    to the forests. All of them share your privations and your toils, ameliorate your sufferings, divide
                    your cares, soothe your sorrows, and inspire you with joyful hopes—thus contributing
                    immensely towards the great work of turning a desert into a garden, and constituting the very soul
                    and vital energy of your patriotism;—for it is <hi rend="i">they</hi> who make you love
                    your home and your country.</p>
            <p>It is for you, ladies, that I have reserved the repeating of a name, at the sound of which every
                    American bosom beats with a prouder swell, and without which every 4th of July oration must be
                    defective and insipid—the name of him who was "first in war, first in peace, and
                    first in the hearts of his countrymen"—to you, in the revered characters of
                    wives and mothers, a most important, a most pleasing task is assigned. It is you who watch over and
                    direct the first shoots of the infant mind, as it gradually expands beneath your fostering
                    guardianship. That direction which you then impress upon it, is the one which it will ever after
                    retain. It is you who form the character for life. The natural affections are the first which
                    develope themselves, and are the first which should be gratified—The <hi rend="i">first</hi> name which your child lisps, is that of his <hi rend="i">father</hi>—The
                    social feelings then begin to come in play, and I beg that the <hi rend="i">second</hi> name which
                    you teach your son to utter, may be that of the Father of his country. Make his illustrious
                    character and example the standard after which you endeavor to model him, and you may rest assured,
                    that in proportion as you make your son resemble that great man, exactly in the same proportion will
                    he be the pride and comfort of your declining years, a blessing to society, and an honor to his
                    country—Instil into his infant mind the sacred principles of religion, and the great
                    moral lesson it inculcates—Next to his God, instruct him in his duty to his
                    country—Show him, as his capacity for instruction increases, the intimate and necessary
                    connexion between those sacred relations—Read to him the declaration of Independence and
                    let its golden truths, its sacred principles be deeply impressed upon his mind—Let the
                    example of HANCOCK and ADAMS, of FRANKLIN and JEFFERSON, of KUSCIUSCO and LA FAYETTE, and the host
                    of worthies whose names illumine, the pages of our history, be ever held up to him for
                    imitation—Tell him of their patriotic zeal and firmness in the senate, of their heroic
                    valour and fortitude in the field—And, finally, for a consumation of all that can dignify
                    the hero, the patriot, the statesman, the sage, and the Christian, name to
                    him—WASHINGTON!</p>

            <p>The National Archives has recently announced the removal of all restrictions on access to the
                    manuscript population schedules of the 1900 census. Although this census has been
                    "open" for several years, potential researchers had to fulfill certain
                    requirements before access could be granted; in addition, this census was available for examination
                    only at the National Archives in Washington or at one of the regional Federal Records Centers. With
                    the lifting of these restrictions, the manuscript population schedules of the 1900 census and the
                    accompanying index are available for purchase in microfilm form. The Indiana portion of the census
                    schedules fills fifty-eight rolls of microfilm, the index another 254 rolls. At a price of twelve
                    dollars per roll, most individuals desiring access to the entire collection will have to rely on
                    appropriate repositories. (Both the Genealogy Division of the Indiana State Library and the Fort
                    Wayne Public Library have made arrangements to purchase all 312 rolls of Indiana material.) Persons
                    concerned with a particular town, township, city, or county, however, may wish to purchase the
                    roll(s) of microfilm covering their area of interest—or to encourage their local
                    historical society, genealogical society, or public library to do so. For additional information and

            <p>As noted in an earlier issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, the manuscript
                    censuses are a valuable source for students of state and local history.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The
                    nineteenth century schedules (excepting those of 1890, almost all of which were destroyed by fire)

                    <pb n="147" id="VAA4025-074-2-049"/> This is especially true of the 1850 and succeeding censuses, in
                    which the <hi rend="i">individual</hi> instead of the family or household was the basic unit of
                    enumeration. In general, the schedules became more detailed during the late nineteenth century as
                    the enumerators were directed to ask an increasing number of questions. The 1900 census followed
                    this pattern, and the schedules contain a variety of data useful for local and family historians.</p>
            <p>The 1900 census of population repeated most of the questions asked in 1880. For each individual the
                    enumerators recorded name, age, sex, race, and place of birth. Marital status, nativity of parents,
                    occupation (for those ten years of age and over), and months unemployed during the preceding year
                    were also recorded. In addition, one column on the schedule asked for the relationship of each
                    household member to the head of the household (e.g., wife, son, boarder), while three others
                    inquired whether persons ten years of age and over could read, write, and speak English.</p>
            <p>Several questions appeared on the 1900 census schedule that had not been included in previous
                    decennial enumerations. Briefly, these included:</p>
            <list type="simple">
               <item>1) Street names and house numbers (in towns or cities with a street numbering system);</item>
               <item>2) If married, number of years married to current spouse;</item>
               <item>3) For women, mother of how many children and how many of those children still living;</item>
               <item>4) For immigrants, how many years since emigration and current citizenship status (alien,
                        taken out "first papers," or naturalized citizen);</item>
               <item>5) For those of school age, number of months of school attendance during the preceding year;</item>
               <item>6) Whether dwelling was owned or rented; if owned, mortgaged or owned free.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Local historians might make use of this information in a variety of ways, and the following
                    suggestions are intended only as illustrations. Persons desiring to explore aspects of the social
                    geography of a turn-of-the-century urban area, especially one for which city directories are not

                    terms of their spatial arrangement. For example, the residential dispersion of different nationality
                    groups might be plotted with considerable precision.</p>
            <p>The questions on the census regarding maternity permit examination of fertility and infant mortality
                    in a given community. And when these data are combined with the information regarding age and
                    duration of marriage, a number of other demographic questions could be explored.</p>
            <p>The specific information requested of immigrants concerning their length of residence in the United
                    States and their citizenship status should allow consideration of the precise time of arrival and
                    growth of nationality groups in a community. This should be especially useful in places too small to
                    have warranted publication of such information in the printed census. In addition, one might
                    construct indexes to measure ethnic differences in the speed and degree of
                    "assimilation" based upon the rapidity of naturalization. And since the
                    "new" immigration from southern and eastern Europe was well underway by 1900,
                    fruitful comparisons between "old" and "new" ethnic groups
                    should be possible for some localities.</p>
            <p>Responses to the question concerning school attendance will be of value to those interested in
                    education. The differing school attendance patterns of rural and urban children or of the native-
                    and foreign-born might be examined. And combining children's ages with the information
                    concerning their school attendance should permit analysis of the average duration of schooling at
                    the beginning of this century.</p>
            <p>Finally, the data dealing with homeownership provide an opportunity for the community historian to
                    explore a number of interesting questions. How widespread was homeownership? Were there significant
                    differences in real property acquisition between age groups, ethnic groups, rural and urban
                    residents, and so on? What percentage of an area's homeowners owned their dwelling
                    outright, and what percentage had assumed a mortgage?</p>
            <p>To repeat, the subjects for inquiry suggested here are not inclusive; local historians will think of
                    many other uses for this census data, either as a result of their own particular interests or
                    because a unique situation in their community demands attention. And the census manuscripts, it
                    should be stressed, have little or no relevance to numerous historical questions that deserve to be
                    asked and answered. Still, the detail contained on the schedules of the 1900 census makes it a
                    particularly valuable source. The lifting of restrictions on its use is an event of utmost
                    importance for family and community historians.</p>

            <p>Nothing illustrates more clearly the present high level of interest in state and local (or the newer
                    term, family and community) history than the number of helpful handbooks and monographs which have
                    recently appeared. This renewed interest had begun prior to the Bicentennial observance and the
                    publication of <hi rend="i">Roots</hi>, but it was certainly stimulated by the one and continues to
                    be sustained by the other as time goes on. The four small volumes reviewed here are representative
                    of the widespread interest crystallized by these recent events. Any number of other publications
                    could have been chosen which would illustate different interests and illuminate additional <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="154" id="VAA4025-074-2-056"/> areas of the state and local history movement. Surely the
                    "States and the Nation" series, aiming to produce an interpretative volume on each
                    of our fifty states plus the District of Columbia, is the most ambitious undertaking of all.</p>
            <p>It might be noted in passing that of the four books discussed here, three were directly commissioned
                    by or were inspired in one way or another by the Bicentennial. The American Association for State
                    and Local History continues to be a most effective agent in weaving the many divergent strands
                    present in family and community history into a useable fabric. The <hi rend="i">volumes by Creigh
                        and Felt were, in fact, published by</hi> that association.</p>
            <p>The most unusual monograph of the four here reviewed is the one by Helen Cavanagh, professor of
                    history emerita at Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois. Cavanagh paints local history with
                    broad, bold strokes while reviewing a lifetime of stimulating service in the classroom and in the
                    direction of graduate student research. In the first of her five short chapters she struggles to
                    perfect a useable definition of local history and cites with approval Henry Steele
                    Commager's dictum that in the writing of any history the essential ingredients are
                    "integrity, imagination and common sense." She finds merit in Carl
                    Becker's streamlined definition that "history is the <hi rend="i">memory</hi> of
                    things said and done" and ends by suggesting that the meaning of local history may be
                    largely in the mind of the labeler or the beholder.</p>
            <p>By far the most impressive of Cavanagh's contributions, however, is her effort to wrestle
                    with the philosophic requirements of a modern approach to local history. While granting the
                    contribution which quantitative social science <hi rend="i">may</hi> be able to make to the writing
                    of history, Cavanagh's real message is a stirring appeal for the centrality of history in
                    the educational curriculum and a warning against losing sight of the historical process in our
                    endeavors.</p>
            <p>The remaining three volumes are directed toward the needs of the small, local historical society and
                    its devotees, with each approaching its audience from a slightly different point of view. For books
                    of limited size their claims are not the least bit modest and perhaps even a bit over ambitious.
                    Marston's <hi rend="i">Guide</hi> is the most substantial of the lot, is the only hardback
                    among them, and is also the most comprehensive. In a series of twenty-two well-written chapters the
                    author ranges all the way from "how to find the right ideas" and "the
                    historian as detective and scholar" through oral history and the use of audio-visuals <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-074-2-057"/> to historical poetry, historical fiction, biography, and even
                    job opportunities—especially for women. If reading about how to do history can substitute
                    for actually doing it, this volume can save the beginner years of experience! Even though it
                    contains a good bit of what might be described as extraneous material, Marston's <hi rend="i">Guide</hi> will inspire young and inexperienced writers with visions of success even
                    while preparing them for the frustrating journey through research, writing, rejection, rewriting,
                    editorial changes, and, finally, acceptance and publication.</p>
            <p>Thomas Felt's cleverly written treatise very largely replaces the long useful <hi rend="i">Local History: How to Gather It, Write It, and Publish It</hi> (1941) by Donald Dean Parker.
                    The new volume, <hi rend="i">Researching, Writing and Publishing Local History</hi>, will prove to
                    be an up-to-date and generally helpful guide to these three essential aspects of any effort at
                    serious historical study. Not surprisingly, the book's rather unimaginative organization
                    finds chapter one devoted to research, chapter two to writing, and chapter three to publishing. The
                    research chapter contains a good discussion of the complicated mechanics of doing history, including
                    a review of many of the sources for local history such as plats and maps, manuscripts, newspapers,
                    interviews, and government, church, and business records; strangely absent, however, is any mention
                    of the availability of federal and state census records for the nineteenth century and the inviting
                    possibility for demographic studies utilizing the new computer technology. Chapter two on writing
                    devotes less attention to actual writing skills and techniques than it does to a realistic appraisal
                    of the potential buying publics for various types of local history publications. The section on
                    footnotes is especially good as Felt makes this sometimes intimidating subject both clear and
                    logical. The final chapter, on publishing, offers useful, up-to-date, and practical information on
                    book design and production problems. This is an extremely valuable section of great interest to
                    anyone who has ever (or for that matter, who has never) experienced the joy and misery of seeing a
                    publication, large or small, through the press. Felt's book closes with an annotated
                    bibliography of references appropriate for the three topics discussed in this spare, 165-page
                    handbook.</p>
            <p>Finally, the delightful and intensely practical <hi rend="i">Primer</hi> by Dorothy Weyer Creigh is a
                    joy to review. The author begins her book with a series of questions which any historical group
                    interested in forming a society would do well to ask itself at the outset. Why do you want to have a
                    historical society? What is <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-074-2-058"/> your scope? Who are your members?
                    How do you finance it? Where do you get help? How do you begin? These questions, and others like
                    them, are explored in the fourteen chapters which follow, and suggestions are offered on just about
                    every kind of activity in which a historical society might want to be engaged. Does the group wish
                    to be a museum society, a library, a site-marking group, a restored building agency, a publishing
                    house—or more likely a combination of some of the above? All are dealt with
                    sympathetically and at some length in <hi rend="i">A Primer for Local Historical Societies.</hi> In
                    the author's own words, this book was written for the historical society which "is
                    short on money, but long on enthusiasm, imagination and ingenuity, and is geographically remote from
                    professional help and advice" (p. ix). This combination of characteristics will surely
                    strike a responsive chord in the inner circles of many local historical agencies. One of its most
                    valuable features is the list of "Other Help Available" at the conclusion of
                    nearly every chapter. Also useful are the five appendixes appearing at the end which provide
                    addresses for state and provincial (Canada) historical, arts and humanities, conservation, and
                    foundation support groups which have much to offer local societies.</p>

            <p>Nearly all contributors to this book have been, or currently are, identified with Indiana
                    University-Purdue University at Indianapolis. Under the editorship of Ralph D. Gray, they have
                    written chapters on twelve Hoosiers nominated at least once for the presidency or vice-presidency of
                    the United States. No fewer than sixteen campaigns were involved. Nine of the twelve nominees ran as
                    major party candidates. Two (one Whig and one Republican) became White House occupants. And four
                    (two Republicans and two Democrats) reached the nation's second highest office.</p>
            <p>If anyone has reservations about the quality of Indiana's professional historians, such
                    skeptics are urged to peruse this volume. For here is no mere "rewrite
                    job"—no indication that editor and authors were satisfied with what predecessors
                    committed to print. The scholars went to the sources and, having examined everything pertinent they
                    could find, proceeded to compose sandpapered and polished essays. Thus the products of their pens
                    are both readable and reliable.</p>
            <p>The most impressive asset, however, is the one of interpretation. It was to be expected that
                    something new along this line would be offered in the cases of William H. English and J. Frank Hanly
                    (to pick evident examples). But similarly stimulating are the treatments of Schuyler Colfax, Eugene
                    V. Debs, Charles W. Fairbanks, Benjamin Harrison, Thomas A. Hendricks, George W. Julian, Thomas R.
                    Marshall, and Wendell L. Willkie. And Bernard Friedman (writing on William Henry Harrison) and Peter
                    J. Sehlinger (on John W. Kern), while benefiting from the cited work of Robert G. Gunderson and
                    Virginia F. Haughton, have performed superbly on facets which most readers probably never heard of.</p>
            <p>The book includes a few unfortunate expressions, such as "Henry Clay's Compromise
                    of 1850" (p. 37). Abraham Lincoln appointed Montgomery Blair, not Horatio King (p. 66),
                    postmaster general. Kern became a state senator after moving from Kokomo to Indianapolis (p. 201).
                    Indiana's importance as a pivotal or doubtful state in presidential elections is suitably
                    emphasized on pp. vii-viii, 107, 183, and elsewhere. Extraordinarily <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-074-2-060"/> discerning is the discussion (pp. 162–63) of the 1890
                    congressional election. Delightful humor, with which several appraisals are sprinkled, is
                    exemplified in James H. Madison's story (p. 185) of how Fairbanks was fancifully
                    transformed from "Buttermilk Charlie" into "Cocktail Charlie."
                    Partial or total revisionism fairly often is a feature—on pp. 22–23 respecting
                    "Old Tippecanoe," for instance; on pp. 114–15 in connection with the
                    1880 campaign, and on pp. 258, 261, and 265–68 with reference to Hanly.</p>
            <p>There is no reason to direct attention to rotten apples in the Gray barrel, for fortunately there are
                    none. If the index is thin, the bibliographical essays are most helpful. In sum, the book is a
                    first-rate contribution not only intrinsically but because it suggests so much scholarship which may
                    henceforth be undertaken in Indiana and elsewhere. Happily, <hi rend="i">Gentlemen from Indiana</hi>

               <hi rend="i">The Indiana Experience: An Anthology.</hi> Compiled and edited by A. L. Lazarus.
                    (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1977. Pp. xvi, 426. Index of authors and titles. Clothbound,
                    $15.00; paperbound, $4.95.)</head>
            <p>Indiana has always been a writing state. From the days of Edward Eggleston and Lew Wallace to those
                    of Theodore Dreiser and Ernie Pyle the Hoosier commonwealth has produced a flood of fiction, essays,
                    autobiography, and verse, much of which has left an impact on the American reading public. Books
                    like <hi rend="i">Alice of Old Vincennes, A Hoosier Holiday</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Alice Adams</hi>
                    have had multitudes of readers, while the dialect and domestic verse of James Whitcomb Riley live in
                    the memory of a large audience whose tastes are not conspicuously literary. Obviously the
                    anthologist who wishes to represent the Indiana achievement has a major problem in selection.</p>
            <p>A. L. Lazarus has arranged his material by literary types rather than chronologically or
                    thematically. Thus sections are devoted to essays, fiction, biography and autobiography, plays, and
                    poetry. This plan is convenient but not always satisfactory. The two major divisions, life sketches
                    and fiction, occupy about 225 pages, appropriately more than half the book; but eighty pages are
                    devoted to a naive farce by George Ade which focuses on mistaken identity and a dated drama by David
                    Graham <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-074-2-061"/> Phillips dealing with the sexual double standard. The
                    five "Folk Songs and Ballads of Indiana" are trivial in themselves and have
                    nothing to do with the state save that the texts were recorded there.</p>
            <p>Every anthologist must be allowed his own prejudices and his own criteria of excellence, so perhaps
                    it is idle to quarrel with individual items. And surely there is much here worth reading and
                    rereading. It is pleasing to see Dreiser's celebrated short story "The Lost
                    Phoebe," a chapter from Jessamyn West's <hi rend="i">The Friendly Persuasion</hi>,
                    Albert Beveridge's portrait of the youthful Lincoln in Indiana, an Ade satirical tale, a
                    truncated section of Brendan Gill's life of Cole Porter, and Emily Kimbrough's
                    memory of her family's encounter with an early electric car, the Waverly. There are also
                    superior short stories by Kurt Vonnegut, Rex Stout, George P. Elliott, and Jean Shepherd.</p>
            <p>Most of the big names in Indiana literary history also appear here; in addition to Dreiser, Ade, and
                    Riley there are selections from Booth Tarkington, Lew Wallace, and Meredith Nicholson. But where are
                    Eggleston, certainly not forgotten today, Maurice Thompson, Frank McKinney Hubbard (the widely
                    admired creator of Abe Martin)? Where are such distinguished historians as Logan Esarey, author of
                    the admirable <hi rend="i">The Indiana Home</hi>? Why not essays from the two best known American
                    folklorists in the twentieth century, Stith Thompson and Richard Dorson? Why not a few pages about
                    early Bloomington from Baynard Rush Hall's <hi rend="i">The New Purchase</hi> or about
                    Muncie from the seminal book <hi rend="i">Middletown</hi> by Robert S. Lynd and Helen M. Lynd?
                    Hardest of all to condone, perhaps, is the omission of anything from the best poet that Indiana has
                    produced, William Vaughn Moody.</p>
            <p>State and regional anthologies are often weakest in the poetry section, probably because they limit
                    inclusions to short lyrics and attempt to crowd as many authors as possible into a small number of
                    pages. Twenty poets are represented here in some thirty-five pages, nine of them by single entries.
                    Although several of the writers, like Philip Appleman and David Wagoner, have collected their verse
                    in individual volumes, most are relatively obscure, and the poems published here will not command
                    wide attention. It is peculiarly unfortunate to include six songs by Cole Porter under the rubric of
                    poetry. On stage "Night and Day" sung by a flood-lighted performer with a musical
                    accompaniment can be a memorable experience. Reduced to the printed page it is flat and banal.
                    Americans are indebted to Porter for his great services to public entertainment <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-074-2-062"/> as they are to Woody Guthrie for his haunting ballads of social
                    protest. But it is a mistake to link them with writers working in a different idiom and a greater
                    tradition.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Old Northwest in the American Revolution: An Anthology.</hi> Edited with
                    introductions by David Curtis Skaggs. (Madison: The State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1977. Pp.
                    vii, 497. Maps, bibliography. $21.50.)</head>
            <p>This volume of twenty-one reprinted essays, scholarly apparatus removed, includes many of the
                    important contributions to the history of the area "north and west of the River
                    Ohio." The collection is edited by David Curtis Skaggs, whose previous writings dealt
                    mostly with the history of colonial Maryland. Skaggs laudable interest in the region, stimulated by
                    service on Ohio's Bicentennial Commission, led him to conclude that few interested citizens
                    knew much about the Revolutionary West. He wished to inform them and also to show scholars gaps in
                    the secondary literature.</p>
            <p>Having attended and taught at schools much devoted to teacher training, Skaggs probably has heard the
                    dictum: "take the students from where they are." In this case, it may be feared
                    that most citizens are far from able to understand the articles in Skaggs' anthology. In
                    effect, he has assigned a "readings" book without a text. To compensate one might
                    first read Beverly W. Bond's <hi rend="i">The Foundations of Ohio</hi> (garbled in
                    Skaggs' extensive bibliography with another Bond book). Even with some background much of
                    the writing in <hi rend="i">The Old Northwest in the American Revolution</hi> is hard to follow, in
                    some cases because of the complex themes, in other instances because the essays contain minutia or
                    irrelevancies. Neophytes looking for clear exposition will find much strained argument instead.
                    Staughton Lynd's essay, which tends to the "I think, therefore it is"
                    position, may disillusion the beginner regarding one's ability to recover the essential
                    past, especially when compared with Jack Eblen's largely opposing views on the same topic.
                    Longer, more carefully structured introductions and more closely pruned texts could mitigate
                    problems in this publically supported work: but is that possible when the editor refers to
                    "accurate" dialogue that is "not historically verifiable," or
                    declares that Pontiac's war ended in 1765 instead of 1766, or implies the land to be
                    "woodlands," ignoring extensive prairies and swamps? An index would have been
                    helpful too.</p>
            <pb n="161" id="VAA4025-074-2-063"/>
            <p>This reviewer confesses an inability to make a content summary in allotted space. The book contains
                    loosely connected pieces valuable to both professional and lay audiences, showing American
                    alienation from the later British colonial practices, inconclusive western fighting, and the
                    shifting postwar settlement to 1787. How the West influenced its destiny is debated still. This
                    anthology does show that the grand systematizing writers of the quantitative, ethnic, feminist, or
                    psychohistorical persuasions have not taken over Old Northwest history. Remarks about lack of
                    pertinent secondary literature are puzzling given the extensive bibliography. The original articles
                    show that some primary matter is yet unused.</p>
            <p>In sum, experience teaching undergraduates and putting regional books into lay hands raises doubts
                    that many will read through this challenging compilation uncoerced. Confronted by the specialized
                    and diffuse, most will continue opting for fiction, television, or drink, all for under
                    $21.50. If so, American and regional history—pronounced of declining influence
                    in a falsely pragmatic and determinedly sensate society with weakening local bands, but continuing
                    to ignore the need for clear public statements of their purpose and substance—will lose
                    another skirmish.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Finding the Grain: Pioneer Journals, Franconian Folktales, Ancestral Poems.</hi> By
                    Norbert Krapf. (Jasper, Ind.: Dubois County Historical Society and Herald Printing, Inc., 1977. Pp.
                    120. Illustrations, maps. Paperbound, $4.00.)</head>
            <p>Here is a random collection of material that for the most part has merit, but in this particular
                    arrangement does not quite work together. Norbert Krapfs title is clever and well chosen, but the
                    three distinct and only vaguely related sections of the book do not form the strong whole that the
                    title suggests.</p>
            <p>Part I, containing pioneer journals, is a valuable collection of the writings of John L. Betz, August
                    Betz, and Herman Philipp Gerdemann, plus a letter from Christian Dupps to his wife. All these people
                    were part of the hardy German transplantation in Dubois County, Indiana, during the middle years of
                    the nineteenth century. Some of the journal entries were made in the old country and give explicit
                    dates of important family events. This material will be invaluable to genealogists.
                    Gerdemann's journal is particularly interesting for its accounts of his ocean voyage and
                    his trek across the American continent to Cincinnati.</p>
            <pb n="162" id="VAA4025-074-2-064"/>
            <p>It is in Part II where this reviewer feels the author went astray. Part II is merely a collection of
                    German fairy tales which Krapf has copied from volumes he picked up while traveling in Germany
                    searching his family roots. He gives their texts in both English and German, but readers find no
                    assurance, or even a suggestion, that any of these tales were ever told in Dubois County, or that
                    the Dubois County settlers came here with any knowledge of them. This space might have been used to
                    much better advantage by including here a collection of the old yarns and stories that were told in
                    front of the Dubois County firesides. There must be many of these anecdotes still being passed
                    around among the descendants of those first <hi rend="i">families.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Part III includes a superb collection of seventeen original poems by Krapf, inspired by his growing
                    up years in Dubois County. He makes use of such mundane and unpoetic subjects as skinning a rabbit
                    and butchering hogs. Some of his imagery is a bit explicit but nonetheless provides an excellent
                    contemporary touch to conclude the volume. Krapf is a better poet than historian. For instance, on
                    page twenty-nine he asks: "And where is Springelsburg, the town where the previous owner of
                    his land lived?" Almost every southern Indiana historian knows that Sprinkelsburg was the
                    old name for what is now New-burgh in the adjoining county, Warrick.</p>
            <p>On the back cover of the volume is the Dubois County Historical Society's comment:
                    "Hopefully, more pioneer journals and letters will surface as a result of this book
                    …. " Many readers will devoutly wish that this will come to pass and also that
                    Krapf will make available more of his fine poetry.</p>

            <p>During the 1920s and 1930s virtually no home in midwestern America—and perhaps in the
                    entire United States—which had a piano in its parlor lacked an ubiquitous sing-along book
                    called <hi rend="i">Twice 55.</hi> So close in spirit to that collection is <hi rend="i">Folk Songs
                        out of Wisconsin</hi> that it is difficult to imagine that there is not at least an indirect
                    connection between the two books. And, indeed, there probably is, for the songs that are printed in
                        <hi rend="i">Folk Songs out of Wisconsin</hi> were collected in that state from the early 1920s
                    through the late 1940s by Franz Rickaby, <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-074-2-065"/> Asher Treat, Sidney
                    Robertson, and Helena Stratman-Thomas, each of whom assiduously and uncritically transcribed
                    whatever songs people were willing to sing for them. The book, therefore, is a record of what the
                    people of Wisconsin were singing during the first half of the twentieth century, and in this sense
                    only is it a book of folk songs.</p>
            <p>By insinuation, if not by direct statement, the editor of <hi rend="i">Folk Songs out of
                    Wisconsin</hi>, Harry B. Peters, implies that the definitions of folksong accepted by modern
                    musicologists and social scientists (perhaps including folklorists) are overly nice. Be that as it
                    may, they are at least meaningful. Whatever this collection may be, it is not primarily a book of
                    folk songs. Peters clearly accepts the concept that whatever people sing from memory is a folksong.
                    He says in his introduction, for example, that "had it not been copyrighted and widely
                    published over a long span of time, a song such as Stephen Foster's <hi rend="i">Old Folks
                        at Home</hi> would in all likelihood have qualified as folk rather than as popular
                    music." This is utter nonsense and given the lie, if the words "Folk
                    Song" in the title are meant to be significant, by the inclusion of such pieces as
                    "Angels from the Realms of Glory," "The Daring Young Man on the Flying
                    Trapeze," and "In the Baggage Coach Ahead," to name but three of fifty
                    possible examples, each of which has a known author, each of which has been transmitted by print and
                    copyrighted, and each of which is comfortable with the label "popular," but none
                    of which is by any stretch of the imagination a folksong. In fact, Peters' occasional notes
                    are both chatty and haphazard and often incomplete if not entirely misleading. He would have done
                    well to have consulted James J. Fuld's <hi rend="i">The Book of World Famous Music</hi>, an
                    easily available reference volume, before writing his headings.</p>
            <p>But, enough of such carping. There are some actual folksongs in this volume, even some traditional
                    ballads, though in no instance does Peters indicate what they are. In at least one instance
                    ("Well Met, Well Met, My Old True love" [pp. 109–110], "The
                    Ship Carpenter" [pp. 121–22], and "The Demon Lover" [p. 149])
                    he has printed three versions of the same song without apparently recognizing this fact. No, no
                    matter what its title, this is not an anthology of folksongs. Including items as diverse as
                    "Rock of Ages," "The Hunters of Kentucky," "Father,
                    Dear Father, Come Home with Me Now," "Lord Lovell," and "The
                    Ship that Never Returned," it is instead a pleasant record of the songs sung by and the
                    music popular among the lower middle and laboring classes of Wisconsin in <pb n="164" id="VAA4025-074-2-066"/> the first half of the twentieth century. Its most appropriate function
                    would seem to be as a replacement for the now virtually unobtainable <hi rend="i">Twice 55.</hi>

               <hi rend="i">The Man Who Would Be Perfect: John Humphrey Noyes and the Utopian Impulse.</hi> By
                    Robert David Thomas. ([Philadelphia]: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc., 1977. Pp. xii, 199.
                    Notes, bibliography, index. $12.95.)</head>
            <p>John Humphrey Noyes, one of the most radical religious and social reformers of nineteenth-century
                    America, is the subject of perpetual reinterpretation. Most studies have focused on the communes at
                    Putney, Vermont, and Oneida, New York, where he translated his unorthodox ideas into communistic
                    economies, mutual criticism sessions, group marriage, birth control methods, and eugenics
                    experimentation. Robert David Thomas' work attempts to break new ground by exploring
                    Noyes' psyche and interpreting his career decisions as responses to religious enthusiasm
                    and reform movements during his antebellum youth.</p>
            <p>Thomas suggests that the types of perfectionism and religious communalism developed by Noyes helped
                    resolve his own psychological, social, and occupational dilemmas. The youngest student to graduate
                    from Dartmouth in 1831 at age nineteen, Noyes already had acquired the acute insecurity, fear of
                    criticism and failure, uneasiness with women, and growing need for absolute truth and unquestioned
                    personal authority that marked his manhood. Estranged parents, especially an emotionally unstable
                    and domineering mother, were contributing factors. After embarrassment as a lawyer and conversion to
                    Christianity in 1831, Noyes turned to the ministry and was reconciled with his mother. At Andover
                    Theological Seminary and Yale Divinity School he drew strength from identifying himself with St.
                    Paul and began gathering the raw materials for the unique theological structure to satisfy his
                    private needs. His 1834 public declaration of sinlessness alienated his friends and professors,
                    effected his expulsion from Yale, and brought the revocation of his preaching license. Separated
                    from established religious institutions, rejected by recognized perfectionist leaders, and spurned
                    by the woman he loved, Noyes approached insanity in cycles of elevation, contradiction, despair,
                    recovery, and elevation. Not until he assembled his first disciples as the Putney community in 1840
                    and started to subject his parents to <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-074-2-067"/> his righteous will did
                    the young reformer find a microcosmic society in which he could be totally dominant and therefore
                    secure.</p>
            <p>Most will find this volume, with its psychological perspective, extensive bibliography, and thorough
                    documentation a useful introduction to John Humphrey Noyes. Thomas carefully explains
                    Noyes' peculiar beliefs in Christ's second coming in 70 A.D., Christian
                    perfection, the dawn of the millennium in 1847, male continence, complex marriage, stirpiculture,
                    mutual criticism, divine healing, just war, and democratic theocracy.</p>
            <p>On balance, however, the book is a disappointment. It contributes little new knowledge while pressing
                    hard upon the limitations of psychohistory. The interplay of Noyes with the crusades and crusaders
                    for perfectionism, peace, temperance, abolition, and spiritualism is covered but not integrated well
                    with the text. The psychological analysis rests almost exclusively, sometimes uncritically, upon
                    Noyes' propagandistic reminiscences written long after the events took place and upon his
                    college journal, diary, and letters as edited by George W. Noyes in this century. Thomas falls prey
                    to accepting the appraisal of John Humphrey Noyes' own <hi rend="i">Witness</hi> regarding
                    his emotional state and motives for behavior (p. 89). Noyes is used as an unquestioned source for
                    the statements and feelings of others, including arguments of his theological opponent Nathaniel
                    Taylor (pp. 48, 49, 52–54). The analysis strains to make Noyes' symptoms fit
                    preconceived psychological categories (pp. 14, 59). Amid a plodding narrative profuse with Noyes
                    quotations, the main character never emerges as a vital personality.</p>

            <p>The Lincoln assassination has always been the preserve of the amateur. Of the modern Lincoln
                    scholars, only Reinhard H. Luthin wrote at any length on the subject. To be sure, not all works by

                    encyclopedia articles and college textbooks is. David Balsiger and Charles E. Sellier, Jr., who work
                    for Sunn Classic Pictures, wrote this book as a "tie-in" with the motion picture
                    of the same name. In a plot much too complicated to summarize here, they allege various grand

                    bureaucrats conspired; John Wilkes Booth was an unwitting pawn.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Lincoln Conspiracy</hi> utilizes the vast existing literature of
                    sensationalism—Otto Eisenschiml, Vaughan Shelton, Theodore Roscoe—for many of
                    its allegations, laying the by now customary stress on the absurd canard that Edwin M. Stanton
                    masterminded a conspiracy to kill Lincoln. It enlarges upon these somewhat by the use of manuscript
                    collections in the possession of Ray Neff, a professor at Indiana State University and a consultant
                    for the film company. Two superbly researched editorials by William C. Davis prove what a tissue of
                    forgeries, fabrications, and fantasies the Sunn Classic argument is based on (<hi rend="i">Civil War
                        Times Illustrated</hi>, XV I [August, 1977], 33–37; XVI [November, 1977],
                    47–49).</p>
            <p>There is nothing to be learned about the Lincoln assassination from this book, but there is something
                    to be learned about America from it. Cynics will see in it America's debt to
                    "Sloanism": like General Motors under Alfred Sloan, Sunn Classic is in business to
                    make money, not a good product. Others will see clearly what Naomi Bliven. saw when she reviewed
                    some recent books on Adolf Hitler for <hi rend="i">The New Yorker</hi> ([August 29, 1977], 86):
                    "I do not see Hitler as a Prince of Darkness; I do not see him as a prince of anything.
                    Historically the agents of destruction have rarely been epic figures …. Perhaps the human
                    attraction to symmetry makes us unwitting Manichaeans—because we have had great good men,
                    we invent great bad men." Well, Napoleon was no invention, but her insight seems applicable
                    to assassins.</p>
            <p>Americans resist the idea that such obscure figures as the Lincoln conspirators, Lee Harvey Oswald,
                    and Arthur Bremmer can alter history; it makes history seem a purposeless chaos. Instead, they look
                    beyond the hapless killers for truly great villains who manipulated them. In this way, history shows
                    some pattern of struggle between good and evil, even though the evil sometimes triumphs.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Building for the Centuries: Illinois, 1865–1898.</hi> By John H. Keiser.
                        <hi rend="i">Sesquicentennial History of Illinois</hi>, Volume 4. (Urbana: University of
                    Illinois Press, for the Illinois Sesquicentennial Commission and the Illinois State Historical
                    Society, 1977. Pp. xvi, 386. Notes, maps, tables, bibliography, index. $12.50.)</head>
            <p>John H. Reiser's <hi rend="i">Building for the Centuries</hi> is part of the
                    sesquicentennial history of Illinois. It presents a plethora of detail regarding demographic,
                    economic, social, and political developments in the post Civil War era. The appendix includes good
                    maps, indicating by county which party won in the elections of 1864, 1880, 1892, and 1900. Also
                    given are tables showing by decade the foreign-born population in the state, the native-born
                    population and its sources, comparative growth in manufacturing, and the occupation and nativity of
                    employed persons. All of this is very useful in a book intended as both a reference work and a
                    general treatment. Reiser's thesis is explicit: Illinois' economic and political
                    direction for this century was almost predetermined by its modernizing era.</p>
            <p>Pungently critical of the emerging business and political leadership of the era, Reiser is at his
                    best in dealing with individuals and groups for whom he has sympathy. For example, the
                    book's title is taken from a speech by John Peter Altgeld; and much of Reiser's
                    view of the period reflects the values of Altgeld and Jane Addams, albeit they are not always
                    reconcilable. He does explain the contributions of the state's business elites, especially
                    Chicago's meatpackers, merchants, and industrialists. The problem is that Reiser tends to
                    see the men in a social rather than business context. What Reiser has to say about minorities and
                    women is refreshing, and his ways of presenting the information could well be emulated by other
                    scholars. He is not patronizing, and he fits people into society in a meaningful way. His opening
                    chapter—"Of People and Places"—is a fine example of this and
                    an excellent way to begin a book. In part, also, he escapes the major pitfall of the state
                    historian, the tendency to give ideas and events significance by trying to fit them into a national
                    context.</p>
            <p>This is not traditional narrative history. Reiser has chosen to analyze the structure of Illinois
                    society. The wisdom of this decision is obvious because he can treat various
                    topics—agriculture, industry, labor, politics, and culture—in separate
                    chapters. But there are weaknesses in this approach. Repetition is inevitable. Moreover, since
                    events are more important in one context than another, Reiser is forced to mention persons and <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-074-2-070"/> events before he explains them. A reader unfamiliar with the
                    state's history could find some of this heavy going.</p>
            <p>The book has other shortcomings too. With so much good illustrative material available, it is
                    unfortunate that there are no pictures. They would surely have enhanced the reader's
                    appreciation of both urbanization and industrialization. Unfortunately, too, Keiser has riot treated
                    politics and social mobility in a more modern manner. In a sense this seems to be the result of his
                    research design. His bibliography indicates a heavy reliance on materials published before 1970, and
                    he has not made use of essays published in non-Illinois magazines. As a result, for example, there
                    are few references to Joel Tarr, Humbert Nelli, or Richard Jensen. The works of these authors and
                    others would have forced Keiser to think differently about his subject.</p>
            <p>This is good state history. Well written, intelligent, and pointed, it makes a useful volume
                    available for layman and scholars alike. It is certainly the peer of recent volumes prepared in
                    Indiana and Ohio that cover the same period.</p>

                    Trial.</hi> Edited by George J. Graham, Jr., and Scarlett G. Graham. (Bloomington: Indiana
                    University Press, 1977. Pp. xviii, 395. Notes, table, bibliography, appendix, index.
                    $17.50.)</head>
            <p>The thirteen essays contained in this volume investigate and assess the principles upon which the
                    United States political system was laid and trace their evolution over the last two hundred years.
                    It is fitting that Charles Hyneman, whom the editors identify as providing the stimulation for the
                    volume, contributed two essays. The first, "Republican Government in America,"
                    provides an overview of the political system; the second, "A Call for Political
                    Theory," contains a plea for the development of a modern political theory to guide the
                    people in a period of profound constitutional change. Among the topics discussed in other essays are
                    separation of powers, popular consent and popular control, the Presidency, Congress, the Supreme
                    Court, political parties, and the government and the economy. Most of the essayists provide a
                    succinct and accurate survey of a complex portion of America's political heritage, usually
                    with more emphasis on the origins than the evolution.</p>
            <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-074-2-071"/>
            <p>Unfortunately the volume is filled with a variety of factual, editorial, and grammatical mistakes.
                    One would get the impression that the Navigation Acts were enacted in the middle 1700s (p. 61), that
                    the House of Representatives only was given the power to declare war (p. 90), that Samuel Paterson
                    represented New Jersey in the Constitutional Convention (p. 148), and that there was a redrafting of
                    the constitution in 1789 (p. 189). Infelicities of style appear throughout, such as
                    "strangely enough" (p. 35), "most fundamental" (p. 98),
                    "which, as all know," (p. 135), and the excessive use of "we"
                    (p. 172). A sentence has been omitted from page 315. Finally, the bibliographic citations in the
                    notes and the bibliography are inconsistent and in the case of Elliot's <hi rend="i">Debates</hi> confusing. An incorrect title for Elliot is given in the bibliography (p. 357),
                    and various dates and publishers appear on pages 26, 132, 165, and 303.</p>

                    Wertheimer. (New York: Pantheon Books, 1977. Pp. xx, 427. Illustrations, notes, bibliography, index.
                    Clothbound, $15.95; paperbound, $6.95.)</head>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">We Were There</hi> is the first history of its kind to appear in nearly seventy years.
                    Welcome enough for that reason alone, the book also is interesting, readable, and useful. It is
                    embellished with songs, poems, illustrations, and over four dozen biographical sketches of mostly
                    little known but important women labor figures. The book is suitable for high school, college, and
                    continuing education classes, and makes a nice companion volume to Rosalyn Baxandall, Linda Gordon,
                    and Susan Reverby (eds.), <hi rend="i">America's Working Women: A Documentary
                        History—1600 to the Present</hi> (1976).</p>
            <p>Drawn almost entirely from secondary sources, <hi rend="i">We Were There</hi> highlights primarily
                    the roles and activities of women wage-earners from colonial times to World War I. For these and
                    other reasons, Barbara Mayer Wertheimer readily concedes that her book only begins to tell
                    "the story of <hi rend="i">working</hi> women and their contribution to America"
                    (p. xi). She omits artists and most professionals, but includes colonial, pioneer, and slave women,
                    as well as nurses, clerks, teachers, telephone operators, printers, shoemakers, cigarmakers, textile
                    workers, and many others. She also discusses the activities of working-class and other women in the
                    American Revolution, the Civil War, and the suffrage movement.</p>
            <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-074-2-072"/>
            <p>Wertheimer's most important chapters describe how women adapted to an industrializing
                    society. If colonial (and to some extent early nineteenth-century) women were "supervisors
                    of all home production" (p. 23), industrialization forced women out of homes into
                    factories, thereby altering family work routines and the meaning of work and producing by 1914 a
                    largely smokestack workforce whose labor was managed by others. Throughout the
                    period—from the Lowell mills and Lynn shoe factories in the nineteenth century, to the
                    southern mills and mines and the Lawrence textile factories early in this century—women
                    sought to shape their own lives as women and as women workers. Like men workers, women encountered
                    stiff anti-labor sentiments and often failed in their attempts to organize unions and conduct
                    strikes. Yet women workers also were opposed because they were women: even the early American
                    Federation of Labor's leadership thwarted women's efforts to gain admittance to
                    the same trade unions as men. The book ends as those efforts began to succeed.</p>
            <p>The text and bibliography could have been enriched if Wertheimer had consulted social history
                    publications, state historical journals, and Ph.D. dissertations. These and other sources also might
                    have helped correct an overemphasis on eastern industrial centers. Still, this fine book enables
                    both women <hi rend="i">and</hi> men "to draw strength from those women who went
                    before" (p. 376) and should stimulate more interest and research in this important subject.</p>

                        1665–1965.</hi> By James A. Clifton. (Lawrence: The Regents Press of Kansas, 1977.
                    Pp. xx, 529. Maps, illustrations, appendixes, notes, bibliography, index. $22.50.)</head>
            <p>Adopting a refreshing attitude devoid of "sentimental moralizing," anthropologist
                    James A. Clifton has written an impressive interpretive study of the Potawatomi people. Although he
                    addresses himself to lay readers as well as scholars, non-specialists will likely founder amid
                    intricate discussions of lineage and social organization.</p>
            <p>Clifton writes from an ethnohistorical approach, bringing to his subject a knowledge of Algonkin
                    languages, familiarity with historical and ethnological accounts, acquaintance with oral traditions
                    and archaeological investigations, and first-hand <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-074-2-073"/> experience
                    with Potawatomi communities in Kansas, Wisconsin, and Canada. The monograph's organization
                    is roughly chronological; sections which cover "persistence and change" within
                    Potawatomi culture alternate with portions describing historical events.</p>
            <p>Historians have too often been insensitive in writing the history of living Indian communities.
                    Clifton's use of pseudonyms out of respect for his informants' anonymity may
                    bother some scholars. More will be disturbed by his admitted fabrication of "dates, ages,
                    and circumstances to prevent identification of the true source" (p. xvii).</p>
            <p>Clifton frequently describes an historical event or an aspect of Potawatomi culture from
                    Euro-American printed sources and then draws upon tribal folklore and other oral sources to present
                    their perspective. Because he has carefully outlined Potawatomi ideology, Clifton succeeds in giving
                    us a feeling for Indian perceptions. Increasingly one feels confident enough to predict Potawatomi
                    intentions and responses.</p>
            <p>This revisionist study is replete with insights too numerous to catalog in a brief review, and
                    mention of a few must suffice. In his analysis of Potawatomi adaptations to historical change
                    Clifton explores how "upstart chiefs" rose to challenge the relatively weak
                    traditional village leaders (<hi rend="i">okamek</hi>). For well over a century, the Potawatomi
                    failed to develop leaders within their communities who had the expertise to cope with drastic
                    changes affecting their society. Thus, as contacts with Euro-Americans increased, and as the tribal
                    estate expanded, peaked, and then contracted, mixed-blood and alien "intercultural
                    brokers" became crucial intermediaries who both served and exploited the Potawatomi.</p>
            <p>The author's linguistic capabilities help him build a sophisticated analysis of Potawatomi
                    treaty signatories, their clan and political affiliations, and the like, from which he draws
                    provocative conclusions about Potawatomi history in the treaty era.</p>
            <p>Since the nineteenth century, ethnocentric assumptions have created considerable uncertainty about
                    Potawatomi "tribal" indentity. Clifton clears up much of the confusion surrounding
                    this Algonkin-speaking people of the Great Lakes. Although he concentrates on the Prairie Band,
                    because they are "the major repository of the modern versions of ancient Potawatomi ethos,
                    value system, language, and cultural and social patterns" (p. xiv), he does not ignore
                    other Potawatomi groups.</p>
            <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-074-2-074"/>
            <p>Especially pertinent to Indiana history are Clifton's assessments of Potawatomi life in the
                    Old Northwest, their participation in the Tecumseh resistance, relations with other tribes,
                    involvement with the powerful political-trade combine of John Tipton and the Ewing family, and many
                    forced and voluntary migrations and resettlements. No one can fault Clifton for portraying the
                    latter simplistically as a series of "trail of tears" removals in which the
                    Potawatomi were helpless victims. Instead, he stresses the various adaptive strategies and choices
                    many of them made in the face of American pressures.</p>
            <p>Clifton writes clearly, even flashing occasional witty or sarcastic asides. Perhaps inherently, his
                    discussions of Potawatomi resistance to allotment and the Indian Reorganization Act and post-World
                    War II politics are bound to offend some modern factions.</p>
            <p>Ethnohistorians are fortunate to have this attractively designed and well-documented book. Along with
                    R. David Edmunds' <hi rend="i">The Potawatomies: Keepers of the Fire</hi>, soon to be
                    published by the University of Oklahoma Press, it will serve as an important benchmark for Great

               <hi rend="i">American Indian Policy in Crisis: Christian Reformers and the Indian,</hi>
                    1865–1900. By Francis Paul Prucha. (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1976. Pp. xii,
                    456. Notes, illustrations, maps, bibliography, index. $15.00.)</head>
            <p>After the Civil War ended in 1865, relations between Indian tribes and the United States government
                    were chaotic. On the Great Plains the warriors of many tribes were wreaking vengeance upon emigrants
                    and wagon trains so that programs had to be initiated to bring peace and security to the western
                    frontiers. Missionaries, church groups, and reformers concerned about the American Indians heartily
                    endorsed President Ulysses S. Grant's peace policy and the creation of the Board of Indian
                    Commissioners. At best, however, all United States Indian policy could achieve was an amelioration
                    of the harsh conditions of life for Indians as they were concentrated upon reservations. The
                    reservation system itself, the friends of the Indians beleived, was a barrier to the solution of the
                    "Indian problem." Reservations segregated Native Americans and permitted tribal
                    society and government and communal land ownership to flourish. Unless reservations were destroyed,
                    the American Indian would never become an Indian American.</p>
            <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-074-2-075"/>
            <p>In the 1880s, eastern humanitarians formed organizations to influence public opinion, the United
                    States Congress, and the executive branch of the federal government. Among the key organizations
                    were the Boston Indian Citizenship Committee, the Women's National Indian Association, the
                    Indian Rights Association, and the Lake Mohonk Conference of the Friends of the Indian. The leaders
                    of these groups, including Lyman Abbott, Amelia S. Quinton, Albert K. Smiley, and Herbert Welsh,
                    were imbued with the values of American evangelical Protestantism. They applied those beliefs in
                    their campaigns to replace tribalism with individualism, tribal membership with American
                    citizenship, communal property with private ownership of land, supernaturalism with Christianity,
                    and tribal lore with American education. The Christian reformers tied individualism, Prucha
                    contends, "closely to the Puritan work ethic. Hard work and thrift were the virtues that
                    seemed to be at the very basis of individual salvation …. Allotment of land in severalty
                    to the Indians was insisted upon because the reformers believed that without the personal labor
                    needed to maintain the private homestead the virtue of hard work could never be inculcated"
                    (pp. 153–54). The Christian reformers attained their objective when Senator Henry L.
                    Dawes managed the General Allotment Act of 1887 through Congress.</p>
            <p>By 1900, the Christian reformers "looked at their works and judged them good ….
                    Congress had enacted their legislative program, which they were convinced would quickly Americanize
                    all the Indians. Tribal organization and communal traditions they had dealt crippling if not fatal
                    blows, and they had established programs and structures to transform the tribesmen into individual
                    citizens of a Christian nation" (p. 402). With proper administration of the Dawes Act and
                    its perfecting amendments, the philanthropists were certain that the Indians would rapidly blend
                    into white society. Prucha concludes they were wrong because the reformers did not understand the
                    tenacity with which the Indians would maintain their own culture. He might also have added that the
                    reformers did not give sufficient consideration to the mendacity and greed of whites. Allotments and
                    property were ripped away from Indian citizens by their white neighbors who exploited every
                    opportunity provided by Congress during the Progressive era to appropriate Indian resources.</p>
            <p>This is a very significant study of United States Indian policy. The research is thorough, the prose
                    is clear, the exposition of ideas is crisp, and argumentation is skillfully presented. <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-074-2-076"/> It provides a new understanding of the intellectual and social sources
                    of the assimilationist movement which long dominated United States Indian policy.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Black Tennesseans, 1900–1930.</hi> By Lester C. Lamon (Knoxville: The
                    University of Tennessee Press, 1977. Pp. xi, 320. Illustrations, notes, tables, bibliographical
                    essay, index. $14.50.)</head>
            <p>The accuracy of Frederick Douglass' oft quoted remark that "if there is no struggle
                    there is no progress" becomes painfully evident after reading Lester C. Lamon's
                        <hi rend="i">Black Tennesseans, 1900–1930.</hi> Lamon traces the attitudes of urban
                    blacks in Tennessee from the beginning of the century, when racial proscriptions were tightened,
                    until the onset of the Great Depression. His thesis is that as new constraints were imposed, most
                    blacks, after some abortive protest attempts, adopted the accommodationist approach of Booker T.
                    Washington. "The overriding feature of life for black Tennesseans in the early twentieth
                    century was the <hi rend="i">separate</hi> community—separated … partly by
                    force and partly by choice" (p. vii).</p>
            <p>Black Tennesseans had already settled into a segregated existence by 1900 with little outward
                    protest. Many did, however, express their dissatisfaction by leaving the more constricted rural
                    setting for the greater mobility offered by the cities. This growing urban black population is
                    probably what instigated the new race codes after 1900. Laws closing the last loophole to integrated
                    education, a Jim Crow streetcar law, and political trends including lily white Republicanism, the
                    white Democratic primary, and commission type city governments in the first decade of the new
                    century effectively isolated the black urban dwellers.</p>
            <p>As the brief reaction against these new restrictions subsided, blacks pursued the Washingtonian
                    approach of separate industrial education and black economic development. Black leaders in Tennessee
                    seemed willing to accept the conditions imposed by whites as a way to avoid racial conflict and a
                    sure road to eventual equality, but the result was a reinforcement of white discriminatory patterns.
                    The willingness to accept "half a loaf never proved to be a gradual road to equality, but
                    rather one of permanent second class citizenship.</p>
            <p>Lamon's conclusions about the overall accommodationist stand of black Tennesseans are not
                    surprizing, but are perhaps <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-074-2-077"/> somewhat overstated because of his
                    heavy reliance on sources from the traditionally conservative sector of black
                    life—educators, newspapermen, and businessmen. Also, his contention that blacks were in
                    the mainstream of the Progressive movement is based on a rather broad interpretation of
                    progressivism. This movement was a basic questioning of the fundamental nature of the emerging
                    corporate society in America. As Lamon shows, blacks did not question the racist underpinnings of
                    the Progressive movement. The ameliorative reforms they sought during the Progressive era were those
                    that blacks had always sought and cannot be considered part of the new progressivism.</p>
            <p>These few criticisms in no way detract from the value of Lamon's study. This book is well
                    conceived and the research reveals a knowledge of extensive primary sources. It is a book that
                    should be read by anyone interested in black history and American race relations.</p>

                        1914–1941.</hi> By Ernest C. Bolt, Jr. (Charlottesville: University Press of
                    Virginia, 1977. Pp. xvii, 207. Notes, bibliography, index. $15.00.)</head>
            <p>The movement to require a referendum on declaration of a foreign war is a misunderstood and neglected
                    aspect of the American search for peace. Ernest C. Bolt, Jr., has attempted to correct historical
                    and popular misconceptions by tracing the history of the war referendum approach to peace in the
                    twentieth century and placing it in the broader context of the American peace movement. His
                    well-researched study is based on the personal papers of the major proponents of war referendum
                    legislation and of the peace organizations which supported such proposals. A considerable portion of
                    the book (thirty-four pages) deals with the pre-World War II congressional activities of
                    Representative Louis L. Ludlow of Indiana in attempting to secure passage and adoption of a
                    constitutional amendment requiring a referendum before entry into any war except in the event of
                    attack or invasion by a foreign power.</p>
            <p>Bolt's limited subject is an important one in the history of American efforts to avert war
                    through the use of democratic legal processes. He has succeeded in his attempt to correct <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-074-2-078"/> those historians who have dismissed or attacked the referendum
                    approach, especially Ludlow's proposed amendment, as a dangerously simplistic move backed
                    by a few fanatic isolationists. As he points out, many of its critics during the 1930s and since,
                    have discredited the Ludlow amendment by overlooking its exception of defensive wars. Bolt
                    demonstrates the close relation of the war referendum approach to principal strands in the American
                    peace movement—anti-imperialism, internationalism, domestic progressivism, and
                    neutrality. He indicates that there was widespread popular support for the war referendum approach
                    throughout the interwar period and that at one time or another nearly every major figure in the
                    peace movements of the early twentieth century advocated its adoption. William Jennings Bryan,
                    Robert La Follette, Norman Thomas, Jane Addams, and Charles Evans Hughes all endorsed it, and the
                    1924 platforms of both the Democratic and Progessive parties called for introduction of a
                    constitutional amendment similar to the one Ludlow proposed in 1935. Failure of the proposal lay in
                    its proponents' shortsighted adherence to "limited-power isolationism," a
                    belief that the United States should use its military might only for national self-defense, at a
                    time when events in Europe and the Far East had made such a belief untenable. A significant feature
                    of the referendum proposal was its advocates' effort to prevent executive usurpation of the
                    war power, a feature poignantly recalled in congressional debates during the Indochinese conflict.</p>
            <p>Bolt's account of this significant movement, failure that it was, has intrinsic merit, and
                    it is unfortunate that his style is frequently awkward and prosaic. Footnotes are distractingly
                    numerous and lengthy and contain information which, incorporated into the text, would produce a
                    livlier, clearer account. Bolt has narrowed his topic too much for the reader unfamiliar with the
                    history of American pacifism; information is tantalizingly incomplete. After discussing in detail
                    several proposals submitted for the Bok Peace Contest in 1922, he fails to mention what or whose
                    entry won and whether it incorporated the war referendum suggestion of so many contestants. Despite
                    such shortcomings, Bolt's volume is a useful addition to the growing number of fine studies
                    of the American peace movement.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Adlai Stevenson and the World: The Life of Adlai E. Stevenson.</hi> By John Bartlow
                    Martin. (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., 1977. Pp. 946. Notes, illustrations,
                    index. $15.00.)</head>
            <p>The last volume of John Bartlow Martin's two-volume biography of Adlai E. Stevenson is
                    essential reading for anyone who would understand fully the twice-defeated Democratic presidential
                    candidate and the main issues of American foreign and domestic politics between 1952 and 1965. The
                    author was an adviser and speechwriter to Stevenson and later envoy of Democratic presidents,
                    serving as ambassador to the Dominican Republic from 1962 to 1964. He is now a professor at
                    Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism.</p>
            <p>Martin shows that there was much to admire about Stevenson, a man who was ahead of his times in many
                    areas of political concern and who had the quality often rare in politicians of being in private
                    what he appeared to be in public. He was not an intellectual, but he appreciated and attracted the
                    support of intellectuals, making their best ideas part of his programs. Only moderate in his support
                    of school desegregation in the South, he called for the federal government to concern itself with
                    what historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., a key adviser, termed "the quality of American
                    life" (p. 125) and laid the groundwork for what would become the New Frontier of John F.
                    Kennedy and the Great Society of Lyndon B. Johnson. Stevenson feared communist expansion and
                    accepted American involvement in Vietnam, but he supported efforts to reduce world tension through
                    disarmament. Influenced by his friendship with British economist and writer, Barbara Ward, he
                    scorned the cold war rhetoric of John Foster Dulles and called for the United States to appeal to
                    the countries of the third world by its example as a humane and tolerant society and by its
                    participation in the United Nations.</p>
            <p>The major difficulty with the book is its length. The author's apparent desire to include
                    all of Stevenson's activities makes the book at times more a travelogue, collection of
                    documents, or diary than a biography. Too often the author has included information which seems
                    unnecessary, such as: "In March, Stevenson spoke at Colgate and at North Carolina State
                    College; he spent weekends at Libertyville; and time in Chicago." This tendency is
                    unfortunate because Martin's sound historical knowledge and commitment to accuracy have
                    caused him to be dispassionate and judicious when he does venture opinions. He shows, for instance,
                    that Stevenson was frequently <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-074-2-080"/> self-deprecating and
                    soul-searching when he should have been decisive. Stevenson also gave some poor speeches at crucial
                    times, such as after receiving the 1956 Democratic nomination for president.</p>
            <p>Despite its shortcomings, the book is a remarkable accomplishment. Unlike the broadly thematic and
                    interpretive earlier biographies by Alden Whitman, Herbert J. Muller, and Bert Cochran,
                    Martin's book draws upon the primary sources. The author's personal acquaintance
                    with Stevenson, full access to his papers, and interviews with nearly all his friends and associates
                    have enabled him to perform the biographer's task of evaluating Stevenson the man, the
                    politician, and the diplomat in the context of his times.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Transcribing and Editing Oral History.</hi> By Willa K. Baum. (Nashville: American

            <p>One dubious legacy of the American Bicentennial orgy was a veritable explosion of grass roots oral
                    history projects. Throughout the country local history enthusiasts eagerly produced oral history
                    tapes. Most of these spontaneous and amateur efforts have quietly and deservedly perished, but many
                    survived and today face the sobering and tedious task of transcription and editing. It is for such
                    worthy individuals that this slender and useful book was designed.</p>
            <p>The author is a veteran in the field and director of the Regional Oral History Office at the
                    University of California, Berkeley. She also is author of a popular companion volume that
                    concentrates on the preliminaries and interviewing phases of oral history.</p>
            <p>Transcribing and editing are tiresome jobs, but this book reduces them to manageable steps. Willa K.
                    Baum offers straightforward transcribing instructions, a reasonable approach to editing, and
                    step-by-step advice on recordkeeping. There also are helpful sections on narrator's review,
                    legal considerations, finishing touches, and depository arrangements. One third of the book consists
                    of sample transcripts, model forms, and other illustrations.</p>
            <p>It is unfortunate if not ironic that a manual on editing and proofreading is itself the victim of
                    editorial carelessness. There <pb n="179" id="VAA4025-074-2-081"/> are numerous lapses in spelling,
                    punctuation, and grammar. The slang and cliches that abound were probably inserted to enliven the
                    text, but they only debase it. Without intending it, the author and publisher have given beginners a
                    bonus proofreading and editing exercise—the book itself.</p>
            <p>Within the oral history guild some practitioners may differ with Baum over terminology, her sequence
                    of steps, or her recommended editing style. But the inquiring novice may safely overlook such
                    quibbling. Oral history methodology remains sufficiently eclectic for beginners to adopt any of
                    several sensible approaches. This book offers one sound prescription, based on considerable
                    experience. Its advice is practical, reasonable, and understandable, making it a good investment for
                    newcomers.</p>

               <hi rend="i">A Bibliographical Guide to the History of Indian-White Relations in the United
                    States.</hi> By Francis Paul Prucha. (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1977. Pp. x, 454.
                    Clothbound, $17.50; paperbound, $6.95.) The sheer size of this bibliography
                    reveals the vast energy expended by historians, ethnohistorians, and anthropologists on the native
                    American and indicates the rich potential in aspects that have yet to be explored or deserve to be
                    probed more deeply. The bibliography includes nearly a thousand entries beginning with the sources
                    and concluding with listings on method. Except where pertinent for the history of relations between
                    whites and Indians in the United States, it excludes anthropology and material on Canadian and
                    Meso-American peoples. Organization is topical and chronological. One chapter supplies listings for
                    specific tribes. The index contains author and subject entries and provides an efficient mechanism
                    for using the bibligraphy. <hi rend="i">Bernard Sheehan, Indiana University, Bloomington.</hi>

               <hi rend="i">French Imprint on the Heart of America: Historical Vignettes of 110 French-Related
                        Localities in Indiana and the Ohio Valley.</hi> By Mary Elizabeth Wood. Second printing.
                    (Knightstown, Ind.: The Bookmark, 1977. Pp. xxxi, 304, 20. Illustrations, notes, selected
                    bibliography, index. $13.65.) This reference guide to French-related localities in the
                    heart of America constitutes a step toward filling a void in the field of early French influence in
                    the United States. Wood should be commended for her zeal and perseverance. The intriguing end result
                    might have been more satisfying, however, had the author chosen to identify the nature of French
                    influence in the light of more rigorous selective criteria. The fact that Yorkville was founded by
                    one French family is not sufficient justification for establishing a solid claim to French heritage.
                    Moreover, some unfortunate inaccuracies found their way into the volume, particularly in reference
                    to Vincennes. There is no evidence of French presence around Vincennes prior to the late 1720s. The
                    fort itself was built no earlier than 1730 by Sieur François Marie de Vincennes, the son
                    of the commander of Fort Miamis. Finally, the volume is an intriguing reference source where history
                    flirts with folklore and facts mingle with fiction. <hi rend="i">Liliane Krasan, Indiana University,
