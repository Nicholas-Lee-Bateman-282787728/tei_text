				<head rend="center">PREFACE</head>

				<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> temptation to express individual judgment on the merits and
					results of constitutional provisions in Indiana is very great. The object of the present
					book is not to do that, but to give the facts, and that in outline, for the use of
					schools. For the grammar grades these simple facts are enough, in the opinion of the
					writer. The high school student must think and investigate somewhat for himself. He should
					make the references carefully. The teacher will assign other books which should be read
					with interest. The Commonwealth of Indiana is now old enough to have a profound interest
					in the history and government of the State. Pupils in the public schools ought to be
					encouraged and instructed in the study of early Middle West affairs. Popular government is
					yet in a formative, even chaotic, condition. The leading facts about the form of the
					government must therefore be taught to students in the grades and high schools. That is
					the object of this small volume. <hi rend="right">D<hi rend="sc">EMARCHUS</hi> C. B<hi

					<p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> 1783 Virginia ceded all her claims to the Northwest Territory to
						the United States. Virginia had claimed ownership, and justly, too, because George
						Rogers Clark, one of her citizens, had wrested the western country from the British, who
						had taken it from the French, the first settlers. La Salle, as early as 1669, had
						explored the Ohio, and some years later he passed up the Wabash. The first trading posts
						in what is now Indiana were established at Ouiatanon, just below Lafayette, in 1720, and
						seven years later Vincennes was settled. These posts were under the control of the
						French officials in Canada. Prior to the settlements of the French the whole western
						country was in the possession of the Indians. Savage Indian chiefs, the French King, the
						King of England, the Federal Government, and the present State Government, have
						controlled the territory known as the Commonwealth of Indiana. Even the New England
						colonies and New York, as well as Virginia, before 1787, laid claim to this territory,
						but really had no civil control over it. The ordinance of 1787, superseding the
						ordinances of 1784 and 1786, which had been without results, is of the most value in
						studying the formative period of our government.</p>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">O<hi rend="sc">RDINANCE OF</hi> 1787</head>

						<p>A Governor, Legislative Council of five members, Secretary and Judges, were to be
							appointed by Congress. A House of Representatives of at least ten was chosen by the
							people.</p>
						<pb id="VAB9257-014" n="2"/>
						<p>Religious freedom is granted.</p>
						<p>Schools are encouraged.</p>
						<p>Good faith shall be kept with the Indians.</p>
						<p>Not more than five States shall be formed from the Northwest Territory.</p>
						<p>There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except for the punishment of
							crime.</p>
						<p>Trial by jury, habeas corpus, and bail shall always be granted.</p>
						<p>Boundary lines are fixed for future States in this territory whenever 60,000
							inhabitants have settled there.</p>
						<p>The present government of Indiana is largely based on this ordinance.</p>
						<p>In 1787 Arthur St. Clair was chosen Governor, and three Judges were named with
							jurisdiction over this Northwest Territory. Vincennes was the capital.</p>
						<p>Twenty-two delegates to a General Assembly and a council of five were named in 1798.
							These delegates organized a legislative body in 1799. Later, in 1800, Indiana
							Territory was constituted and defined as all of the Northwest Territory west of what
							is now the eastern line of Indiana.</p>
						<p>The government of Indiana Territory began in 1800, at Vincennes, with William Henry
							Harrison as Governor. There were several attempts to modify the slavery clause in the
							1787 ordinance, but to the credit of the people, these were all frustrated.</p>
						<p>Indiana Territory was made smaller and smaller as the years went on. In 1805 Michigan
							was detached, and in 1809 Illinois. In a few years, as the population increased, the
							demand for statehood was heeded, and in 1814 Congress passed an enabling act, which
							was followed in 1816 by the First Constitutional Convention sitting at Corydon. There
							were forty-three members.</p>
						<p>This was superseded by the present Constitution, which was framed by the
							Constitutional Convention of 1850-51, and approved by the people at a popular
							election.</p>

								rend="sc">IGHTS</hi></head>

						<p>
							<hi rend="b">The Preamble.</hi>--In the Constitution of Indiana, the preamble
							expresses what is common to all such articles, namely, that justice should be
							established, public order maintained, and liberty perpetuated; and further, that the
							people of the State of Indiana are grateful for the right to choose their own form of
							government.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Bill of Rights.</hi>--The following points are covered in this,
							evidently, in part, a copy of the Declaration of Independence and the Federal
							Constitution:</p>
						<p>All men are created equal. All power is inherent in the people, who have at all times
							a right to alter their government.</p>
						<p>All men have a right to worship God according to the dictates of their own
							consciences, and no law shall interfere with the exercise and enjoyment of religious
							views. No law shall give preference to any creed, society, or mode of worship. No
							religious test shall be required. No money shall be drawn from the public treasury for
							the benefit of any religious institution.</p>
						<p>The laws shall not restrain the interchange of opinion nor restrict the right to
							speak on any subject whatever.</p>
						<p>All citizens shall be secure in their persons and houses, and shall not be subject to
							search or seizure without due warrant. Every man shall have a right in due course of
							law to preserve his property or reputation. The courts shall be open. An accused
							person shall have the right to a public trial and to meet his accusers face to face.
							No person shall be subject to trial twice for the same offence, nor be compelled to
							testify against himself.</p>
						<p>Cruel and unusual punishments shall not be inflicted. The penal code shall be founded
							on the principles of reformation and not vindictive justice. Trial by jury shall
							always remain inviolate. No man's property shall be taken by law without
							compensation.</p>
						<pb id="VAB9257-016" n="4"/>
						<p>The General Assembly may not grant privileges to any citizen which shall not equally
							belong to all citizens. No law shall be passed impairing the obligation of contract.
							The writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended. Treason shall consist only in
							levying war against the State.</p>
						<p>No law shall restrain the inhabitants of the State from assembly in a peaceable
							manner, nor from applying to the Legislature for redress of grievances.</p>
						<p>The military shall always be kept in subordination to the civil power. No soldier
							shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house without the consent of the
							owner.</p>
						<p>The Legislature shall not grant any title of nobility nor confer hereditary
							distinction. There shall not be any slavery nor involuntary servitude within the
							State, except for the punishment of crime.</p>
						<p>There are many points in this Bill of Rights which deserve very careful attention.
							Many of them are far in advance of the time in which they were adopted. They are, in
							fact, the leading part of the whole Constitution.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Suffrage and Election.</hi>--Elections shall be free and equal. Every
							male citizen, twenty-one years old, who shall have resided in the State six months, in
							the township sixty days, and in the precinct thirty days, preceding the election,
							shall have the right of suffrage. If a foreigner shall have resided in the United
							States one year, and shall have fulfilled the above requirements, and shall have
							declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States, he shall be entitled
							to vote.</p>
						<p>Every person who shall have given or offered a bribe, threat or reward to procure his
							election shall be disqualified from holding the office for which he may have been
							elected. No person who is a collector or holder of public funds shall be eligible to
							any office until he shall have accounted for and paid over all sums for which he may
							be liable. All citizens shall be free from arrest in going to elections and returning
							from them. All elections by the people shall be by ballot. All State elections <pb
								id="VAB9257-017" n="5"/> shall be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday
							in November.</p>
						<p>The Bill of Rights, as summed up above, and the sections on Suffrage and Election
							take up the first two articles of the Constitution.</p>
						<p>A<hi rend="sc">RTICLE</hi> III. By this article, the powers of government are divided
							into three departments: the Legislative, the Executive (Administrative), and the
							Judicial.</p>
						<p>A<hi rend="sc">RTICLE</hi> IV of the Constitution, with thirty sections, is devoted
							to the Legislative Department.</p>
						<p>A<hi rend="sc">RTICLE</hi> V, with twenty-four sections, to the Executive
							Department.</p>
						<p>A<hi rend="sc">RTICLE</hi> VI, ten sections, to the Administrative Department, which
							is really a part of the Executive Department.</p>
						<p>A<hi rend="sc">RTICLE</hi> VII, to the Judiciary, in twenty-one sections.</p>
						<p>A<hi rend="sc">RTICLE</hi> VIII is devoted to Education. The State Institutions are
							covered in A<hi rend="sc">RTICLE</hi> IX; Finance in A<hi rend="sc">RTICLE</hi> X;
							Corporations in A<hi rend="sc">RTICLE</hi> XI; the Militia in A<hi rend="sc"
								>RTICLE</hi> XII. A<hi rend="sc">RTICLE</hi> XIII discusses in one section,
							Political and Municipal Corporations. Boundaries are defined in A<hi rend="sc"
								>RTICLE</hi> XIV. All other topics except Amendments are given in A<hi rend="sc"
								>RTICLE</hi> XV, entitled "Miscellaneous," while A<hi rend="sc">RTICLE</hi> XVI
							defines the method of Amendment.</p>

					<head rend="center">LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT</head>

					<p><hi rend="b">The Two Houses.</hi>--According to the Constitution, there shall be a
						Senate and a House of Representatives. The Senate shall have no more than fifty, and the
						House of Representatives no more than one hundred members. Senators shall be elected for
						a term of four years and Representatives for two years. A provision is made that the
						Senators shall be divided by lot into two equal classes; so that twenty-five shall be
						elected every two years. The result of this is that there are always twenty-five
						experienced members in the Legislature. Senators and Representatives must be citizens of
						the United States and at least twenty-five and twenty-one years of age respectively.</p>
					<p>The number of Senators and Representatives shall be apportioned among the counties
						according to the number of voters in each. Districts are then made according to this
						enumeration.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Rights of Members.</hi>--Privilege from arrest is granted to all members
						of the Legislature during its sittings, nor shall the members be subject to any civil
						process during the sitting of the Assembly, nor during the fifteen days immediately
						preceding the same. A member shall not be questioned for any speech or debate in either
						House, except in the House itself.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Sessions.</hi>--Biennial sessions of the General Assembly must be held at
						the capital of the State, beginning on the Thursday after the first Monday of January
						every second year after 1853. The Assembly, however, has the right to name a different
						day or place by law. A special session may be called by the Governor if he believes that
						the public welfare requires it. Sixty-one days is the limit of the regular session,
						forty of the special.</p>
					<pb id="VAB9257-019" n="7"/>
					<p><hi rend="b">Officers.</hi>--Each house shall choose its own officers and shall be the
						judge of the election and qualification of its own members, and may determine its own
						rules of procedure. The Senate chooses its secretary, clerks, and doorkeepers just as
						the House does, but not its presiding officer, which position the Lieutenant-Governor
						fills. The House selects its own presiding officer, the Speaker.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Miscellaneous Duties of the Two Houses.</hi>--Each house shall keep a
						Journal of its Proceedings which must be published. Two-thirds of the members constitute
						a quorum. A smaller number, however, may meet and adjourn from day to day and compel the
						attendance of absent members. The doors of each house shall be kept open. The members
						may be punished by either house and even expelled by a two-thirds vote. Persons who are
						not members may be imprisoned by either house for disorderly behavior in its presence.
						Bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives. All other
						bills may be introduced in either house.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Method of Law-Making.</hi>--Every bill shall be read by sections on three
						separate days unless, in case of emergency, two-thirds of the members dispense with this
						rule. The vote on the passage of every bill shall always be by yeas and nays. A majority
						of all the members of each house shall be necessary to pass a bill and all bills so

					<head rend="center">CHAPTER III</head>
					<head rend="center">EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT</head>

					<p><hi rend="b">The Governor.</hi>--The Governor is the Chief Executive of the State. He
						serves for four years, and shall not succeed himself. No person shall be eligible to the
						office of Governor unless he has been a citizen of the United States for five years, and
						of Indiana for five years immediately preceding his election.</p>
					<p>He shall be at least thirty years of age. The following duties are imposed upon the
						Governor:</p>
					<p>First: He shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.</p>
					<p>Second: He shall have the power to grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons for all
						offences except treason and impeachment, subject, of course, to the law.</p>
					<p>Third: He shall be the Commander-in-Chief of the military forces of the State, and may
						call out such forces to execute the laws.</p>
					<p>Fourth: He shall give to the Legislature in the form of a message information on the
						condition of the State, and recommend whatever measures he thinks proper.</p>
					<p>Fifth: He shall sign all bills which have passed the General Assembly. If he does not
						sign, he must return the bill with his objections to the house in which it originated.
						This house shall enter the Governor's objections on its journals and may then reconsider
						the bill and by a majority of the members pass it over the Governor's veto.</p>
					<p>Sixth: The Governor shall appoint certain heads of departments and members of Boards
						and Commissions according to law. (These will be pointed out further on.)</p>
					<p>Seventh: He shall issue writs of election to fill vacancies which may occur in the
						General Assembly.</p>
					<pb id="VAB9257-023" n="11"/>
					<p>The term of office of the Governor shall commence on the second Monday in January in
						every fourth year after 1853.</p>
					<p>If the capital of the State should be in danger from disease or from a public enemy,
						the Governor may convene the Legislature at some other place. The salary of the Governor
						shall be fixed by law and shall not be increased nor diminished during his term of
						office.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">The Lieutenant-Governor.</hi>--The Lieutenant-Governor is elected at the
						same time as the Governor and members of the Legislature and serves for four years.</p>
					<p>The same conditions of citizenship are required as of the Governor. The
						Lieutenant-Governor shall be the President of the Senate and shall serve as Governor if
						the Governor be removed from office or if he is unable to discharge the duties of the
						office. In such a case as this, the Senate shall select one of its own members as its
						presiding officer. As presiding officer of the Senate, the Lieutenant-Governor has the
						right to join in debate in committee of the whole, and to vote. Otherwise, he shall give
						the casting vote whenever the Senate is equally divided. The compensation of the
						Lieutenant-Governor is fixed by law and is the same as that of the Speaker of the House
						of Representatives. In the case of contested elections for either Governor or
						Lieutenant-Governor, the decision shall rest with the General Assembly. Neither the
						Governor nor Lieutenant-Governor shall be eligible to any other office during the term
						of service for which he shall have been elected.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Other Elective Officers.</hi>--The Constitution provides for the election
						of a Secretary of State, an Auditor, and Treasurer, to serve for two years. They may,
						however, be re-elected, but only for four years in any period of six. Their duties are
						implied by their titles.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Secretary of State.</hi>--The public records of the State are kept by this
						officer. He attests the signature of the Governor. All articles of incorporation are
						granted and the record of them kept in this office. The Secretary of State keeps the
						enrolled <pb id="VAB9257-024" n="12"/> bills of the General Assembly and publishes and
						distributes the Session Laws. Like all other State officials, he makes a report to the
						Legislature. The requirements of his office are defined in detail by law. He is a member
						of the State Board of Tax Commissioners and the Commissioners of Public Printing.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Auditor of State.</hi>--This official is the State's bookkeeper. He keeps
						the accounts of the State with the counties, the United States, and other States. All
						warrants on the State's funds are drawn by him in accordance with appropriation acts
						passed by the Assembly. He collects the money due to the State. Insurance companies,
						State banks, and building and loan associations report their condition to him. Bank
						examiners are appointed by the Auditor. The land records are also under his charge. The
						Auditor is a member of several commissions which will be mentioned further on.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Treasurer of State.</hi>--The Treasurer gives a large bond that he will
						keep safely the funds of the State. At present, however, the money is deposited in
						banks--named according to law--and the interest belongs to the public. Money is paid
						into the treasury through an order of the Auditor, and may be paid out only on a warrant
						of the same officer specifying the party to receive it and the fund from which it is
						drawn. No money can be paid unless duly appropriated by the Legislature. The Treasurer
						must by law publish in the newspapers at stated times the condition of the State's
						funds, and must make a biennial report to the Legislature. The fiscal year of the State
						begins October first. All unexpended balances are transferred to the general fund at the
						end of the fiscal year.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Attorney-General.</hi>--This officer represents the State in all legal
						matters. He interprets the law for all State officials and advises the Legislature as to
						the constitutionality of a proposed law. He defends the commonwealth in all of its suits
						in court and serves as prosecutor for the State. He collects forfeitures, fines, or fees
						due the State. This office was created by law in 1855. The term is two years.</p>
					<pb id="VAB9257-025" n="13"/>
					<p><hi rend="b">Geologist.</hi>--According to law, the State Geologist must be a geologist
						and natural scientist. He is the Curator of the State Museum of Geology and Natural
						History. He is required to make geological surveys of the State and collect and publish
						information about the natural resources of the State. These facts are presented in his
						Geological Reports. The Geologist is elected for four years.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">State Superintendent of Public Instruction.</hi>--This very important
						position is subject to nomination by political parties.</p>
					<p>This official is elected for a term of two years, without any limitation as to the
						number of terms. His duties cover all the subjects bearing on public education and the
						distribution and use of funds for that purpose. The school laws and their administration
						are subject to the interpretation of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. He must
						compile statistics of the schools and report biennially to the Legislature the condition
						of the school revenue and school property. The school funds of the various counties are
						also subject to his inspection. He is the President of the State Board of Education.
						According to the Constitution, the Legislature may add to his duties. The official force
						under the Superintendent of Public Instruction includes trained people to assist in the
						supervision of the common schools in the State.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Statistician.</hi>--This office was not established by the Constitution,
						but by law in 1879. The object is to collect and present general statistics on labor,
						social conditions, manufacturing, mining, and all the interests of the State. These must
						be reported to the Governor and to the General Assembly. By a recent law, an Employment
						Bureau is under the control of this office. In this, with its departments in different
						sections of the State, men and women out of employment may be registered, and persons
						looking for workingmen or help of any sort may register in this office.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Clerk of the Supreme Court.</hi>--This officer is elected by popular vote.
						He preserves the records of the Supreme Court <pb id="VAB9257-026" n="14"/> and issues
						the writs of that court. His term of office is four years.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Reporter of the Supreme Court.</hi>--The law of 1875 established the
						office of Reporter of the Supreme Court, to serve for four years. All decisions of the
						Supreme and Appellate Courts are arranged and printed by this officer.</p>
					<p>The last two officers mentioned belong properly to the courts; but, as they are classed
						as State officials, it is not out of place to put them in the list of elective
						officers.</p>
					<p>All State officers may be removed from office for crime, incapacity, or negligence,
						either by impeachment by the House of Representatives with the Senate as a trial court
						or by a joint resolution of the General Assembly. This must, however, be done by a
						majority of two-thirds of the members.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">State Board of Health.</hi>--This Board has three divisions: the first
							may be called the State Board of Health. It consists of five members, four of whom are
							appointed by the Governor, Secretary of State, and Auditor of State. These four elect
							the fifth member who becomes the Secretary of the Board. He is the Chief Health
							Officer of the State. The duties of the Board are varied: It must keep a record of all
							births and deaths, of all infectious diseases, and must keep a complete record of the
							vital statistics of the State. The Board of Health has the right of inspection of the
							public school buildings of the State with power to close them if they are not kept in
							a sanitary condition. The health officers of the various townships are under the
							supervision of this State Board. The second department is called the State Laboratory
							of Hygiene, Food, and Drugs, and is in charge of a Commissioner and Chief Chemist
							appointed by the Board of Health. This department is charged with the examination of
								<pb id="VAB9257-027" n="15"/> foods and drugs as manufactured and sold in the State
							of Indiana. By a recent law, the weights and measures are under control of this
							department. The third department is the Bacteriological Department in charge of a
							superintendent appointed by the Board. In this department microscopical examinations
							of bacteria and germs are made to find the cause and nature of diseases. It takes a
							large staff of trained physicians, chemists, pathologists, and inspectors to conduct
							the work of this Board in a proper manner.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">State Board of Medical Registration and Examination.</hi>--The law of
							1897 established this Board. There are six members appointed by the Governor, for a
							term of four years each. The granting of licenses to practice medicine rests entirely
							with the power of this Board. They must by certain rules and regulations decide upon
							the fitness of applicants to practice in the State of Indiana. This is now done by
							examination even after the applicant has received his medical degree.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">State Board of Education.</hi>--There are eleven members of this
							Board--eight of them ex-officio, namely, the Governor, Superintendent of Public
							Instruction, the Presidents of the three State Schools, and the Superintendents of
							Schools of the three largest cities in the State. Three more are appointed by the
							Governor from persons actively engaged in educational work. This Board has the
							authority to examine teachers for licenses in all the counties of the State, and has
							also the general supervision of the administration of the schools. It serves as a
							Board of School Book Commissioners, to adopt text-books for the schools of the State.
							The Board prescribes courses of study and designates and classifies certain schools
							which shall have the power to give normal instruction. High schools receive their
							commissions and certificates from the Board of Education. This Board also elects five
							trustees of Indiana University.</p>
						<p>The State Board of Education sits as a State Library Board with power to elect the
							State Librarian and to receive reports from him.</p>
						<pb id="VAB9257-028" n="16"/>
						<p><hi rend="b">Public Library Commission.</hi>-Instruction in library work for persons
							in public libraries, travelling libraries, the organization of public libraries, and
							biennial reports from all libraries of Indiana, make up the duties of the Commission.
							The members, three in number--appointed by the Governor,--serve for three years
							without pay. They select a head organizer with assistants, all of whom are trained for
							library work. A biennial report is rendered to the Governor and the Legislature. A
							library summer school is held every year.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">State Librarian.</hi>--This official is chosen by the State Board of
							Education, sitting as a Library Board. He serves for two years. The Library under his

							discretion of the Librarian. References and advice about books of all kinds are made
							and given to all libraries and citizens in the State. All documents (except laws) and
							reports of departments must be kept on file and distributed by this office. All United
							States Reports also are deposited here for the use of everybody. Books for the blind
							are loaned to blind readers in the State. The Legislative Reference Department is a
							part of the State Library. Its duties are defined by law to be the collection,
							classification, and cataloguing of reports, books, articles, laws, everything that
							will assist the legislator and public official in their work. The drawing of bills
							upon request is also permitted. The head of this department must be educated in
							political science, trained in comparative legislation, and experienced in legislative
							reference work in a good library.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Board of State Charities.</hi>--This Board was created by the law of
							1889. There are six members, appointed by the Governor to serve for three years. The
							Governor is ex-officio member and Chairman of the Board. The duties of this Board are
							very broad, covering the inspection and supervision of all charitable and correctional
							institutions in the entire State, including city and county, and private institutions
							if children are cared for in them. The work of finding homes for and placing dependent
								<pb id="VAB9257-029" n="17"/> children in homes belongs to the department of this
							Board's work known as the State Agency. Members of the Board of State Charities serve
							without pay. The Secretary, who is chosen by the Board, and all the agents and office
							force are paid. The plans for county jails and infirmaries must be approved by this
							Board before building can proceed. The Board issues a quarterly bulletin as well as
							regular reports. Charges filed against any institution are investigated by the Board
							of State Charities either at its own discretion or by direction of the Governor. The
							Township Poor Relief reports are kept on file in this office. In addition, the name
							and history, as far as it can be known, of every inmate of every institution in the
							entire State is filed here for public reference.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Truancy Board.</hi>--Two members, ex-officio, compose this Board--the
							Secretary of the Board of State Charities and a member of the State Board of Education
							selected by that Board. They have general supervision over the execution of the
							truancy laws.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Board of Pardons.</hi>--Though the Governor has the power to pardon
							given him by the Constitution, the law of 1903 established a State Board of Pardons of
							three members appointed by the Governor to serve four years. They shall carefully
							examine into all petitions for pardon which are submitted to the Governor and report
							their conclusions and recommendations to the Governor, who then acts as he thinks
							best.</p>

							be visited once a year by a member of this Board to listen to complaints and collect
							information of the workings of the law. The decisions of the County Board <pb
								id="VAB9257-030" n="18"/> of Review may be appealed to this Board. The assessment of
							real estate in the counties is reviewed and equalized by this Board.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Board of Finance.</hi>--Various laws define the duties of this Board
							which consists of the Governor, the Auditor, and the Treasurer of State. Naturally,
							their labors are connected with the financial policy to be adopted by the State during
							a given administration. They carry into effect the depository law and designate the
							banks where the State's funds must be deposited. The Auditor is the Secretary of the
							Board. The sessions must be public.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Commissioners of Public Printing.</hi>--This is an ex-officio Board
							consisting of the Governor, the Secretary of State, the Auditor of State, and the
							Reporter of the Supreme Court. It is responsible for all the printing and binding

						<p><hi rend="b">The Public Accounting Board.</hi>--A chief examiner and his deputy
							examiners are named by the Chief Executive of the State to serve for four years. The
							Chief Examiner by examination appoints accountants to attend to the detail work. They
							inspect the books and accounts of all public officials in Indiana, township, city,
							county, and State. They establish a uniform system of accounts for all these offices.
							This board was established by law in 1909. A very important service is rendered by
							these examinations. The Board of Accounts, to whom the examiner reports, is composed
							of the Governor, the Auditor, the Treasurer, and the State Examiner.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">The Adjutant-General.</hi>--This officer with the Quartermaster-General
							and the Commissary-General is appointed for four years <pb id="VAB9257-031" n="19"/>
							by the Governor. They must have military training and execute all orders given by the

							officers.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">The National Guard.</hi>--Article XII of the Constitution provides that
							all able-bodied citizens between 18 and 45 years of age may be enrolled in the
							militia. The divisions into brigades, regiments, battalions, and companies, and the
							ranking of officers shall be determined by the Legislature. Persons who are
							conscientiously opposed to carrying arms may be excused, but they must pay for the
							exemption, the amount to be fixed by law. All militia officers above major are
							appointed by the Governor, who is ex-officio Commander of the military forces of the
							State. The law provides for the organization of infantry, artillery, cavalry, hospital
							corps, engineers, signal corps, and military bands. If it is necessary to enforce the
							law, suppress a mob or insurrection, the Governor may call out this militia. Local
							officials, as sheriffs, judges of courts, or mayors of cities, may call upon the
							Governor to send the troops if they are unable to enforce the law. There is a
							Major-General in direct command of the National Guard.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">The Legislative Investigating Committee.</hi>--Indiana is alone in
							having this official body. Ten days after the election of members of the General
							Assembly the Governor appoints two members of the House and one Senator to serve on
							this Committee. They visit every State Institution, and office of every Board,
							Commission, and State Officer, and not only take their written statements as to their
							financial needs for the next biennial period, but also inspect for themselves. Their
							report is made to the legislature and from it the finance committees of the two houses
							decide, in a large measure, upon the needed appropriations.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">State Bureau of Inspection.</hi>--This Bureau was established in 1911
							and takes the place of the Factory Inspector, Inspector of Mines, and Labor
							Commissioners. There is a Chief Inspector in charge of three departments: Department
							of Inspection of <pb id="VAB9257-032" n="20"/> Buildings, Factories and Workshops;
							Department of Inspection of Mines and Mining; Department of Inspection of Boilers. The

							game, animals, and birds, and the execution of the laws on the subject are comprised
							in his work. He may appoint deputies in the counties to assist him. The Governor
							appoints him for two years.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Entomologist.</hi>--The fruit, shade, and ornamental trees of Indiana
							are under the protection of the State Entomologist. His reports and bulletins, in
							which plant diseases are fully discussed, are circulated among the people. By the law

						<p><hi rend="b">Custodian of the State House.</hi>--This officer is in charge of the
							Capitol, its equipment, and the grounds surrounding it. He is appointed by the

							Board is to preserve and renew the timber lands of the State.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Oil Inspector.</hi>--All mineral or petroleum oil, whether manufactured
							or sold in this State, must be inspected. By the law of <pb id="VAB9257-033" n="21"/>
							1903 the Governor shall appoint a chief inspector or supervisor to serve for four
							years. This supervisor shall appoint one inspector in each congressional district. The
							Governor has the right to remove his appointee whenever he is unfaithful in his
							duties. The oil inspectors do not receive a salary from the State. Their pay comes
							from fees for inspections, the amount of which is fixed by law.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">State Veterinarian.</hi>--The health of the domestic animals of the
							State and the prevention of contagious diseases among them rests with the State
							Veterinarian who is appointed by the Governor for four years. He has the power to
							employ assistants to carry out the provisions of the law. The Governor, Auditor of
							State, and Treasurer of State shall fix the salary of this official provided that it

							accounts of the veterinarian.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Registration and Examination of Nurses.</hi>--Five nurses, named by the

							departments: Literary, Scientific, Law, and Medicine. Part of the work of the last is
							done at Indianapolis in the School of Medicine.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Purdue University.</hi>--This is situated at Lafayette. It is the
							Agricultural and Technical School of the State. Its control is in the hands of nine
							trustees. The State Board of Agriculture nominates two and the State Board of
							Horticulture one. The Governor appoints all of them.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">The State Normal School.</hi>--Terre Haute is the place where this is
							located. Its work is the preparation of teachers for the schools of the State. There
							are four trustees named by the Governor.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Insane.</hi>--There are five hospitals for the insane in the
							commonwealth: the Central Hospital at Indianapolis, the Northern at Logansport, the
							Eastern at Richmond, the Southern at Evansville, and the South-eastern at North
							Madison. Each one of the hospitals is controlled by a board of four members equally
							divided politically. They are appointed by the Governor and may be removed for cause.
							They are required to select a trained and experienced superintendent of each hospital
							and leave to him the selection of all his subordinates, who must be chosen for fitness
							and no other reason.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Penal.</hi>--There are five of these in the state: the Indiana Prison at
							Michigan City, the Women's Prison and House of Correction at Indianapolis, the
							Reformatory at Jeffersonville, and for juveniles, the Boys' School at Plainfield and
							the Girls' School at Clermont. These are all controlled the same way as the hospitals
							for the insane, namely, by four directors appointed by the Governor.</p>
						<pb id="VAB9257-036" n="24"/>
						<p><hi rend="b">Epileptic and Tuberculosis Hospitals.</hi>--The village for epileptics
							is located near Newcastle on a farm of twelve hundred acres. It is built on the
							cottage plan. Its control is the same as that of other State institutions. The
							Tuberculosis Hospital, recently opened, is situated at Rockville. There are only three
							members of the board controlling this institution. They are named by the Governor.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">School for Feeble-Minded.</hi>--The care of feeble-minded youth and the

							Wayne, with a farm colony removed some distance from the main institution. The
							Governor appoints four members on this board.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Soldiers' Home and Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphans' Home.</hi>--The
							former of these is near Lafayette, the latter near Knightstown. Former soldiers and
							their wives are cared for at the Soldiers' Home--their orphans at the Soldiers' and
							Sailors' Orphans' Home. Boards of trustees numbering four control each
							institution.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">The Deaf and the Blind.</hi>--The Institution for the Deaf is

							most of the year to the pupils. They are controlled by trustees, four in number,
							appointed by the Governor.</p>
						<p>All of the trustees of the Indiana Girls' School and the Women's Prison are women.

					<head rend="center">CHAPTER IV</head>
					<head rend="center">JUDICIAL--THE COURTS</head>

					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> Constitution, in Article VII, rests the judicial power of the
						State in a Supreme Court, Circuit Courts, and other courts which the General Assembly
						may establish. The Appellate Court for the State at large and Superior, Criminal, and
						Probate Courts for certain counties, and Police Courts for cities, have been authorized
						by law. Justices of the Peace are authorized by the Constitution in each township of the
						various counties.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">The Supreme Court.</hi>--This court shall by the Constitution consist of
						not less than three nor more than five judges. They shall hold their offices for six
						years. The State shall be divided into as many districts as there are judges. The
						judges, however, are elected by all the voters of the State. A judge, however, shall be
						elected from the district in which he resides. There are two terms of this court held
						each year beginning the fourth Monday in May and the fourth Monday in November. The
						judges choose one of their own number as Chief Justice. No judge, however, can serve
						twice as Chief Justice until each of the other judges has presided over the court. Three
						members of the court make a quorum. There are three officers in the Supreme Court--a
						Clerk and a Reporter, elected by the people of the State, whose duties are defined under
						"Administrative Officers"; and the Sheriff, who is appointed by the judges to serve for
						two years. He executes the orders of the Court, serves all their writs, and maintains
						order in the court-room.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.</hi>--The Supreme Court determines the
						cases which have been appealed from the lower courts of the entire State. It ascertains
						whether a particular <pb id="VAB9257-039" n="27"/> law is constitutional and whether a
						trial in a local court has been legally held. A majority of the judges decides the case.
						All the decisions of the Court are in writing and are prepared for publication by the
						Reporter of the Court. Any Judge of the Supreme Court may preside at a trial in any
						county of the district from which he is elected.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">The Appellate Court.</hi>--The Supreme Court was so crowded with cases
						that in 1891 the Legislature created the Appellate Court to relieve the pressure. This
						court was to serve for a few years only, but the business has increased so rapidly that
						the Court is still in existence. There are six Judges in the Appellate Court serving for
						five years. They are chosen by the electors of the State. This Court has jurisdiction in
						all cases appealed from the lower courts which do not in their importance go to the
						Supreme Court. Their decisions are final unless the Constitutionality of a statute or an
						ordinance is questioned. The Clerk and the Sheriff of the Supreme Court serve also in
						the Appellate Court. These Judges are nominated by party conventions and their names
						appear on party tickets.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Court of Claims.</hi>--In Indiana there is no State Court of Claims. If
						any claim is brought against the Commonwealth, it must come before the Superior Court of
						Marion County, which, by the law of 1889, is made a Court of Claims.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Circuit Courts.</hi>--The State is divided into circuits in each of which
						the voters elect a judge for a term of six years. This Judge presides over the Court in
						each county of the Circuit. These Circuit Courts have jurisdiction in all civil and
						criminal cases in the Circuit.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Superior Courts.</hi>--In the more thickly populated counties, it has been
						found necessary to establish additional courts for civil cases. The voters of the
						several counties elect these Superior Judges. Some of these counties have one Superior
						Court Judge while Marion County has five.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Criminal Courts.</hi>--The larger counties of the State have been
						compelled to establish courts in which criminal cases are tried. <pb id="VAB9257-040"
							n="28"/> The Judges of these courts are chosen by the voters in the county, to serve
						for four years. These judges, also, are nominated by party conventions.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Prosecuting Attorney.</hi>--Each Circuit has a Prosecuting Attorney
						elected by the people to serve two years. It is his business to prosecute all offenders
						against the State laws.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Other Officers of the Court.</hi>--The Courts in the several counties have
						clerks to keep the records and papers and administer oaths, and sheriffs to execute all
						writs of the court. Attorneys are also considered officers of the court.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Juvenile Court.</hi>--This Court was created by the law of 1903. It is a
						special court, having jurisdiction in all cases relating to children, delinquent,
						truant, and children asked for by the Board of Children's Guardians. Wherever the legal
						punishment of children is at stake, this court has power. If the population is 100,000
						or more, there is a separate Judge; if less than that, the Circuit Judge sits as
						Juvenile Court Judge. He is elected and serves four years. He has large discretionary
						powers in the trial of children, and the care of children shall be as nearly parental as
						possible. Delinquent parents and all persons responsible for the wrongdoing, suffering,
						or neglect of children may be brought before him.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Probation Officer.</hi>--This officer is appointed by the Juvenile Court
						Judge and is responsible to him and removable by him. He shall inquire into all charges
						against children and assist the judge in deciding what is best to do. He is a paid
						official. There are also volunteer probation officers who do not receive pay.</p>
					<p><hi rend="b">Supreme Court Library.</hi>--This is a part of the Supreme Court and under
						its control. The judges elect the librarian who serves at their pleasure. This library
						is distinctly legal in character. Its use is therefore largely confined to the courts
						and attorneys.</p>

					<head rend="center">LOCAL GOVERNMENT</head>

					<p>L<hi rend="sc">OCAL</hi> officials represent the State in enforcing general or State
						laws, while, at the same time, they perform services for the people of the county or
						city in which they are located. The county and city officers are naturally in closer
						touch with the interests of the community in which they live and serve their
						constituents. They are servants of a twofold nature. One is no more important than the
						other. The "State of Indiana" is no more important than the "City of Indianapolis."
						Local self-government has always been the pride of the Anglo-Saxon race as it was of the
						ancient Greeks. The idea is by no means a modern one. Nor has it reached a very high
						state as yet. In spite of the fact that central and local government exist as separate
						units, they are so interwoven that distinction is not always clear nor well understood.
						The central administrative powers have comparatively little to do with local
						authorities. The local government conducts its own schools, has its courts under State
						laws, collects taxes, holds elections, cares for the unfortunate, maintains police and
						fire forces, in accordance, however, with the general laws of the State. Only under
						certain conditions may the Governor interfere with local affairs. One condition has
						already been pointed out (see military power of the Governor). Another is the filling of
						certain offices when a vacancy occurs, as judges of county courts. Such appointments
						hold good until the next local election. In general, the three divisions--legislative,
						executive, and judicial--are maintained in local government.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">County Commissioners.</hi>--There are three commissioners, property
							holders, elected in each county from three districts, serving three years. No more
							than two are elected at the same time. This Board of Commissioners has large powers,
							partly legislative, partly administrative, partly judicial. They must meet every month
							in the year. They have complete control over the property of the county. They
							construct and repair highways and bridges; they build homes for orphans and the poor;
							they allow claims; they fix the tax levy for the county; they may borrow money; they
							grant liquor licenses; they receive and audit the reports from county and township
							officers; they let contracts; they make reports of all the money received and
							expended; they fill vacancies in the county elective offices. This board by the law of
							1907 is the County Board of Finance. Their pay is determined by law, varying according
							to population.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">The County Council.</hi>--This body is a sort of check on the County
							Commissioners. From itemized estimates made by county and township officials, the
							appropriations are made by this council. These appropriations must not be exceeded.
							The County Auditor, as clerk of the council, presents these estimates with
							recommendations, if he desires. He may also call special meetings of the council in
							addition to the annual meeting. This body by a three-fourths vote may appropriate
							money not asked for in the estimates. It also has the power to expel any of its own
							members for misconduct. There are seven members of this council, four from districts
							and three at large. They serve for four years and are elected by popular vote. The
							salary is nominal and determined by the population, but does not exceed twenty dollars
							per annum. Vacancies are filled by the council itself. Only freeholders may serve.
							This body was established by law in 1899.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Treasurer.</hi>--The County Treasurer is chosen for two years and may be
							re-elected. Only four years in six, however, are <pb id="VAB9257-044" n="32"/>
							permissible. He receives and disburses, on the Auditor's warrant, all public funds.
							His books show the various funds. He gives bond, but places the money in banks or
							trust companies designated by the County Board of Finance, the interest on which
							belongs to the public. He makes an annual report. The State's portion of the taxes is
							paid by him to the Treasurer of State. He may be removed by the County Commissioners.
							This officer collects delinquent taxes and has power to sell property to do this. He
							acts as City Treasurer in cities of the first, second, and third class. The salary
							received varies from $1,200 to $25,000 plus the amount of fees from delinquent taxes
							and other fees. However, he pays his subordinates from these funds.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Auditor.</hi>--He serves four years and is eligible eight years in
							twelve. He settles the accounts against the county by warrants on the Treasurer. He is
							the County Accountant. The school fund is loaned and apportioned by him. The records
							of the County Commissioners are kept by him. The school enumeration is in his charge.
							He prepares an aggregate assessment of all property and calculates the amount
							belonging to State, county, township, school, etc. The salary varies from $1,100 to
							$17,500, according to population. This is increased by the receipt of fees. He pays
							his employees himself.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Clerk.</hi>--The Clerk of the Circuit Court is also County Clerk. He may
							not serve more than twice in succession. The term is four years. He issues marriage
							licenses, administers oaths, and keeps a record of all insanity proceedings; issues
							licenses for the practice of medicine and dentistry, letters of administration, and
							keeps a full record of the actions of the court. The salary is fixed by law and varies
							from $1,200 to $19,500 plus certain fees, from all of which he must pay his
							assistants.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Sheriff.</hi>--The County Sheriff must care for the jail and the
							prisoners; he must execute the decrees of the criminal, circuit, and superior courts;
							he must be present in person or by deputy at the sessions of these courts; he
							preserves order at the polls on election days and makes arrests with or without
							warrant if crime <pb id="VAB9257-045" n="33"/> is committed in his view. The Sheriff
							may call citizens to help him, and if he cannot keep the peace he may call upon the
							Governor. He appoints his deputies, including a jailer. One deputy is the matron of
							the jail if the population is over 50,000. This official is the leading executive of
							the county. The salary varies according to population.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Recorder.</hi>--All public documents, deeds to property, leases,
							mortgages, articles of association and incorporation, liens, maps, and plats of the
							county and assignments are recorded and indexed by the County Recorder. They are open
							to the public. A fee is charged for the service under this officer. He is chosen for
							four years and may serve only eight years in twelve. He receives a salary in addition
							to the fees.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Coroner.</hi>--The chief work of the Coroner is to find out the cause of
							the death of any person by violence or accident. He may summon witnesses and
							administer oaths. He has authority to act when the Sheriff is disabled. He renders his
							decisions in writing and may command the arrest of an accused party. His term of
							office is two years, without limit on the number of terms. As pay, he receives fees,
							except in Marion County where a salary is paid.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Surveyor.</hi>--The County Surveyor serves two years and may be
							re-elected. He surveys lands, roads, and drains, and preserves the maps, charts, and
							books indicating his surveys. A private owner of real estate may request the survey of
							his land and the Surveyor must attend to this. He is paid a per diem fixed by law.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Assessor.</hi>--The holder of this position must have been a free-holder
							in the county four years before election. Four years is the term of office with one
							re-election in a period of twelve years. He examines the assessment books of the
							township assessors and corrects their valuation if he sees fit. He also instructs
							these assessors. His pay varies according to the amount of work. The above described
							county offices are established by the Constitution of the State.</p>

						<p><hi rend="b">County Board of Charities.</hi>--Six persons comprise this Board, one of
							whom is a woman. The Circuit Judge makes the appointments upon petition of fifteen

							inspect all the charitable and correctional institutions in the county every three
							months and make their report with suggestions to the Judge, the Board of State
							Charities, and the County Commissioners.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Board of Children's Guardians.</hi>--This board consists of six members

							whom they may place in homes, or the county may have its own home for these children.
							The members serve without pay and report to the Board of State Charities.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">County Poor Farm.</hi>--The Superintendent of this is chosen by the

							(giving them some work to do if they are able) all persons who become public charges.
							He reports to the County Commissioners the number of inmates, expenses for their care,
							and the amount of produce from the farm.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">County Physician.</hi>--He is employed by the County Commissioners to

						<pb id="VAB9257-048" n="36"/>
						<p><hi rend="b">Board of Review</hi> or Board of Equalization is composed of two

							them with their complaints and petitions.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Jury Commissioners.</hi>--These are of opposite political parties, two
							in number, and appointed by the Judge of the Circuit Court. From the tax duplicate of
							the county, these two select twice as many names as will be necessary for the grand
							and petit juries. They exclude the names of those who have been on a jury within a
							year, non-property holders, and those who are interested in any pending case. Before
							the case begins the clerk draws from the box the names of six persons who become the
							grand jury and of twelve who serve as a petit jury. The key to the box has been in the
							hands of the commissioner who differs from the clerk in politics. These commissioners
							are paid three dollars a day and jurymen two dollars with mileage.</p>

						<p>The congressional township, six miles square, is a part of the government survey, and

							county into civil townships, which conform to the congressional as far as possible.
							The civil township is a political body with power to make contracts, hold elections,
							assess taxes, give relief to the poor, make roads, sue and be sued. There is a school
							township whose boundaries are the same as the civil township, but which is a separate
							corporation having charge of the schools and their property. Every sixteenth section
							in the congressional township was reserved for school purposes. There are 1,016 civil
							townships in the entire State. Each one has the following officers: Trustee, Assessor,
							Justice (or Justices) of the Peace, Constable, Supervisor of Roads, School Director,
							and Advisory Financial Board.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Township Trustee.</hi>--He is the chief local official. His duties are

							enumeration of all male citizens over twenty-one years of age. He is elected for four
							years but cannot succeed himself.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">The Advisory Board.</hi>-This board is to the township what the county
							council is to the county. The estimate of expenses made by the trustee is submitted to
							this board which may curtail <pb id="VAB9257-051" n="39"/> it if it seems fit. The
							board fixes the tax rate. It may borrow money also. There are three members, chosen
							for four years.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Assessor.</hi>--The Assessor is elected for four years and may not
							succeed himself. He assesses personal and real property (the latter every four years),
							and returns his lists to the auditor. His pay varies according to population.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Justices of the Peace.</hi>--They form the court of the township. The
							county commissioners decide upon the number, but not to exceed three, in each
							township. They have jurisdiction in minor cases, both civil and criminal. Appeal,
							however, may be taken to the county court. They issue warrants in criminal cases,
							perform marriages, and preside in insanity trials. Their term of office is four years
							and their pay comes from fees.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Constables.</hi>--This office, like that of Justice, is an old one in
							the Anglo-Saxon race. Each justice has a constable. They execute the orders of the
							justice's court, keep the peace and may make arrests. The justices appoint them.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Road Supervisor.</hi>--Two years is the term of this officer who is
							chosen by the electors in the road district. He has charge of highways and bridges and
							may call upon citizens, between twenty-one and fifty, for their service for two to
							four days in a year.</p>

						<p>Local government is still further narrowed beyond that of the county and township.
							The General Assembly has granted the right of government therefore to towns and cities
							or municipalities. The "village" as a political organization does not exist in
							Indiana. When a community of citizens so desire, they may secure the right of
							incorporation from the legislature and become a town. A minimum of population is
							necessary, however, to become a city--namely, 2,000. The laws defining these matters
							are general and thus apply to all towns and cities alike. Cities were divided into
							five classes by a law passed in 1905. <pb id="VAB9257-052" n="40"/> This law covers
							other matters also, such as the qualification of officers and the general functions of
							city government. The classes of cities are as follows: First, 100,000 population or
							more; second, 45,000 to 100,000; third, 20,000 to 45,000; fourth, 10,000 to 20,000,
							and taxable property to the amount of $5,000,000 or over; fifth, less than 10,000.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">The Town.</hi>--If one-third of the voters of a settlement petition the
							county commissioners for a town government, the commissioners order an election to
							determine whether the citizens want to form a town. If a majority so vote, the
							incorporation is authorized.</p>
						<p>The town is then divided into districts--not more than seven--and officers are
							elected. A trustee is chosen by the whole community for each district or ward. These
							trustees serve four years and are the legislative department of the town, passing all
							the ordinances to govern the town. These ordinances may be on the following subjects
							in general: The improvement of streets and sewers; the building of school houses; fire
							apparatus; street lighting; public health; prevention of vice and keeping peace and
							order by policing the town. The trustees fix the tax levy and elect the school
							trustees--three in number--who serve three years. The voters select also a town clerk,
							treasurer, and marshal. Their duties are such as are implied by the title of the
							office, namely, the clerk keeps the records of the trustees and all papers and books
							of the corporation; the treasurer keeps the funds which he pays out only on a warrant
							signed by the president of the trustees and the town clerk; the marshal is the town
							policeman or constable. If the voters do not wish to keep up a town government, they
							may abolish it by a two-thirds vote of all the voters of the town.</p>

						<p>The city, like the State, has the three departments--Legislative, Executive, and
							Judicial--though not so sharply defined perhaps. In the city the legislative is the
							council; in the State, the General <pb id="VAB9257-053" n="41"/> Assembly; the
							executive is the Mayor, corresponding to the Governor; the judicial is the city court,
							corresponding to the courts of the State. The electors of a city choose the Mayor,
							City Judge, Treasurer, Clerk, and the City Council.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">E<hi rend="sc">LECTIVE--</hi>E<hi rend="sc">XECUTIVE</hi></head>

						<p><hi rend="b">The Mayor.</hi>--The Mayor is chosen for four years. Like the Governor,
							he enforces the laws of the city (primarily) and the State. He appoints the heads of
							departments; recommends measures to the city council; he vetoes or approves all acts
							of the council, calls special meetings of the council, holds consultations with heads
							of departments, and informs the council yearly of the condition of the city. In cities
							of the fifth class the Mayor is the City Judge.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Clerk.</hi>--The City Clerk keeps the proceedings of the council. All
							papers, documents, and records of the city are in his charge.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Treasurer.</hi>--The County Treasurer in cities of the first, second,
							and third classes is also city treasurer. All money is collected in the office of the
							Treasurer. He has charge of these collections and pays out the funds on the
							presentation of properly signed warrants.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">City Judge.</hi>--This official forms the judicial department of the
							city. His term of office is four years. He may assess fines up to $500, administer
							oaths, and imprison offenders for a period of six months or less. His jurisdiction
							extends over violation of city ordinances, petit larceny, and minor misdemeanors.
							Police officers execute the orders of this court.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">City Council.</hi>--The Common Council is the legislative department of
							the city. Each ward has a councilman and, in addition, there are from two to six
							councilmen at large, all chosen by the people to serve four years. The Mayor presides
							over the sessions, except in cities of the first and second classes, in which the
							Council selects one of its own members as presiding officer. <pb id="VAB9257-054"
								n="42"/> Indianapolis has nine councilmen, voted for at large. Monthly meetings are
							required. Special meetings may be called by the Mayor. A majority of all is necessary
							to pass a city ordinance. The council passes appropriation acts, regulates traffic,
							fixes salaries, protects the city by fire and police regulations, grants licenses, and
							regulates and taxes all the business of the city. It selects the School Trustees
							except in the larger cities. The salary is small.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">The School Board.</hi>--This body is appointed by the council in most of
							the cities. There are three members, serving three years, one retiring each year. In
							cities of the first and second classes there are five members elected by the people
							for four years. They are nominated by petition. The schools and school property are
							entirely under their charge. They select teachers, fix salaries, and select the city
							librarian in cities where there is not a library board. They do not receive any
							pay.</p>

						<head rend="center">A<hi rend="sc">PPOINTIVE</hi> A<hi rend="sc">DMINISTRATIVE</hi> D<hi
								rend="sc">EPARTMENTS</hi></head>

						<p><hi rend="b">Board of Public Works.</hi>--Three members are appointed on this board
							by the Mayor--no more than two of the same political party. They have charge of the
							streets, buildings, and sewers. They make contracts on behalf of the city with gas,
							electric, heating, water, and street-car companies--subject to approval by the
							Council. The city engineer and street commissioner, who are appointed by the Mayor,
							are subject to the directions of the Board of Public Works.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Board of Public Safety.</hi>--The general public welfare and protection
							are in charge of a board of three, appointed by the Mayor under the same condition as
							the above-mentioned board. The police and fire departments and building inspection are
							supervised from this office. The chief of police and head of the fire department,
							market master, and building inspector are appointed by this board. In cities of the
							fifth class, police and fire department chiefs are named by the Mayor.</p>
						<pb id="VAB9257-055" n="43"/>
						<p><hi rend="b">Board of Health.</hi>--Three physicians named by the Mayor determine all
							questions relating to the public health and charities. The Superintendent of the City
							Hospital holds his position by their appointment. The hospital, dispensary,
							quarantines, vital statistics, and health ordinances are all under their supervision
							and management.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Board of Park Commissioners.</hi>--These commissioners are four in
							number, receiving their appointment from the Mayor and serving without pay. They plan
							and develop and care for the parks and parkways. They may choose a superintendent with
							assistants.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Controller.</hi>--He is appointed by the Mayor and is the auditor, so to
							speak, of the city finances. Warrants on the treasurer are issued by him. Licenses,
							too, are under his control.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">City Attorney.</hi>--All legal affairs of the city are subject to his
							control. He advises the city officials as to the legality of their measures. In
							Indianapolis there is a corporation counsel also. This is by recent enactment of the
							Legislature.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Superintendent of City Schools.</hi>--The schools of the city are under
							the supervision of the Superintendent chosen by the school board.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">City Librarian.</hi>--The library board appoints the head of the city
							library. In some cities this board is also the School Board, as in Indianapolis. In
							others there is a distinct library board of seven members, three of whom are appointed
							by the Circuit Judge, two by the council, and two by the School Board.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Taxation and Revenue.</hi>--The revenues of the State, county, city,
							town, and township, in general, come from taxes assessed and collected on real estate
							and personal property. Each division of the government assesses and receives its
							portion according to law. There are fees of different kinds also and assessments on
							the property holders for the payment of street and sewer improvements. The State
							government receives certain portions of joint stock association taxes which the Board
							of <pb id="VAB9257-056" n="44"/> Tax Commissioners assesses. There are corporations
							whose property is taxed--railways, telegraph and telephone companies, traction lines,
							banks, gas companies, etc., etc.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">School Revenues.</hi>--The permanent school fund consists of two
							parts--the congressional township fund and the common school fund. The former came
							from the sale of the lands according to the law of congress; the latter is made up of
							all money devoted to school purposes. These funds are loaned by the auditors. They may
							not be decreased. The school trustees and boards fix the school tax assessments. The
							schools have also the liquor licenses, the dog tax, and certain local tuition fees.
							The auditors report the amount of tuition to the State Superintendent who apportions
							it to the counties on the basis of school population. On the same principle the
							auditor apportions to the schools of the county the share of revenue coming to the
							county.</p>
						<p><hi rend="b">Nominations for Public Office.</hi>--Up to recent years the common
							method of nominating candidates has been by party conventions made up of delegates
							chosen by the members of the party. This has been the case in all the political
							divisions of the State. It is still the custom in nominating State and congressional
							candidates. There has been much dissatisfaction, however, because the delegates have
							really been named by the party committeemen and not by the members of the party at
							large. These party committeemen may now be chosen by a primary law according to which
							the persons affiliating with a given party may vote for precinct committeemen under
							certain regulations laid down by the law.</p>
						<p>If a county has a city with a population of 36,000 or more the candidates for county,
							city, township, judicial, and legislative positions must be voted for under the
							primary law. All the voters who are members of a party which cast ten per cent of the
							whole vote at the last preceding election, may register their wishes as to the
							candidates in the same way as they do in electing a candidate to the office. The
							candidates file their names with <pb id="VAB9257-057" n="45"/> the primary
							commissioners. Twenty-five voters of a party may petition the commissioners to have
							the name of a member of their party placed on the primary ballot. These primary
							commissioners are the clerk of the county and two citizens of opposite political
							parties named by him. When the name has been so filed it is placed on the ballot and
							the voters of the party have the right to express their judgment whether the candidate
							shall be named or not. The ballot must be secret. This system is not yet as general as
							in some other States.</p>

				<head rend="center">
					<hi rend="i">In Congress, July</hi> 13, 1787</head>
				<head rend="sc">AN ORDINANCE FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES
					NORTH-WEST OF THE RIVER OHIO</head>

				<p>After providing for the temporary government of such territory as one district, with the
					Governor, Legislative Council and House of Representatives of five members each, Secretary
					and Judges, all appointed by Congress, the ordinance proceeds as follows:</p>
				<p>And for extending the fundamental principles of civil and religious liberty, which form
					the basis whereon these republics, their laws and Constitutions, are erected; to fix and
					establish those principles as the basis of all laws, Constitutions, and governments which
					forever here-after shall be formed in the said territory; to provide, also, for the
					establishment of States, and permanent government therein, and for their admission to
					share in the Federal councils on an equal footing with the original States, at as early
					periods as may be consistent with the general interest:</p>
				<p>It is hereby ordained and declared, by the authority aforesaid: That the following
					articles shall be considered as articles of compact between the original States and the
					people and States in the said territory, and forever remain unalterable, unless by common
					consent, to wit:</p>
				<p>A<hi rend="sc">RT</hi>. 1. No person, demeaning himself in a peaceable and orderly
					manner, shall ever be molested on account of his mode of worship or religious sentiments,
					in the said territory.</p>
				<p>A<hi rend="sc">RT</hi>. 2. The inhabitants of the said territory shall always be entitled
					to the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus, and of the trial by jury; of a proportionate
					representation of the people in the legislature, and of judicial proceedings according to
					the course of the common law. All persons shall be bailable, unless for capital offences,
					where the proof shall be evident, or the presumption great. All fines shall be moderate;
					and no cruel or unusual punishments shall be inflicted. No man shall be deprived of his
					liberty or property but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land, and should
					the public exigencies make it necessary, for the common preservation, to take any man's
					property, or to <pb id="VAB9257-062" n="50"/> demand his particular services, full
					compensation shall be made for the same. And, in the just preservation of rights and
					property, it is understood and declared that no law ought ever to be made, or have force
					in the said territory, that shall, in any manner whatever, interfere with, or affect,
					private contracts or engagements, bona fide, and without fraud, previously formed.</p>
				<p>A<hi rend="sc">RT</hi>. 3. Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good
					government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education, shall forever
					be encouraged. The utmost good faith shall always be observed toward the Indians; their
					lands and property shall never be taken from them without their consent, and in their
					property, rights, and liberty they never shall be invaded or disturbed unless in just and
					lawful wars authorized by Congress; but laws founded in justice and humanity shall from
					time to time be made, for preventing wrongs being done to them, and for preserving peace
					and friendship with them.</p>
				<p>A<hi rend="sc">RT</hi>. 4. That said territory, and the States which may be formed
					therein, shall forever remain a part of this confederacy of the United States of America,
					subject to the articles of confederation, and to such alterations therein as may be
					constitutionally made; and to all the acts and ordinances of the United States in Congress
					assembled, conformable thereto. The inhabitants and settlers in the said territory shall
					be subject to pay a part of the Federal debts, contracted or to be contracted, and a
					proportional part of the expenses of government, to be apportioned on them by Congress,
					according to the same common rule and measure by which apportionments thereof shall be
					made on the other States; and the taxes for paying their proportion shall be laid and
					levied by the authority and direction of the legislature of the district or districts, or
					new States, as in the original States, within the time agreed upon by the United States in
					Congress assembled. The legislatures of those districts, or new States, shall never
					interfere with the primary disposal of the soil of the United States in Congress
					assembled, nor with any regulations Congress may find necessary, for securing the title in
					such soil, to the bona fide purchasers. No tax shall be imposed on lands the property of
					the United States; and in no case shall non-resident proprietors be taxed higher than
					residents. The navigable waters leading into the Mississippi or St. Lawrence, and the
					carrying-places between the same, shall be common highways, and forever free, as well to
					the inhabitants of the said territory as to the citizens of the United States, and those
					of any other States that may be admitted into the confederacy without any tax, impost, or
					duty therefor.</p>
				<pb id="VAB9257-063" n="51"/>
				<p>A<hi rend="sc">RT</hi>. 5. There shall be formed in the said territory, not less than
					three nor more than five States; and the boundaries of the States, as soon as Virginia
					shall alter her act of cession, and consent to the same, shall become fixed, and
					established as follows, to wit: The Western State in the said territory shall be bounded
					by the Mississippi, the Ohio, and Wabash Rivers; a direct line drawn from the Wabash and
					Post Vincents, due north, to the territorial line between the United States and Canada;
					and by the said territorial line to the Lake of the Woods and Mississippi. The Middle
					State shall be bounded by the said direct line, the Wabash, from Post Vincents to the Ohio
					by the Ohio, by a direct line drawn due north from the mouth of the Great Miami to the
					said territorial line. The Eastern State shall be bounded by the last-mentioned direct
					line, the Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the said territorial line; provided, however, and it is
					further understood and declared, that the boundaries of these three States shall be
					subject so far to be altered, that, if Congress shall hereafter find it expedient, they
					shall have authority to form one or two States in that part of said territory which lies
					north of an east and west line drawn through the southerly bend or extreme of Lake
					Michigan. And whenever any of the said States shall have sixty thousand free inhabitants
					therein, such State shall be admitted, by its delegates, into the Congress of the United
					States on an equal footing with the original States, in all respects whatever; and shall
					be at liberty to form a permanent Constitution and State government; provided the
