				INTRODUCTORY.

				

				THE following papers relate to Vincennes and the Wabash country, and
					more or less to the entire Ohio valley. They almost cover the period of English possession
					of this part of the United States, the first being the last orders of the last French
					commandant of Post Vincennes, and the last being a letter of the last English commandant.
					With the exception of the Gage correspondence and papers they are arranged in order of
					date. The Gage papers; beginning with the letter of Ste. Marie, or Jean Baptiste Racine,
					acting commandant of Post Vincennes, to General Haldimand, and closing with the letter of
					General Haldimand to General Gage, in regard to the matter, show the proof of legal title
					and right of settlement in the French people of Vincennes which was demanded by the famous
					letter of General Gage in 1773. This letter will be found in Dillon's History of Indiana
					at pages 86-88.

				I obtained copies of these various documents when writing my "Indiana" for the American
					Commonwealth series. The farewell proclamation of St. Ange was furnished to me by Hon. C.
					B. Lasselle, whose ancestors were among the ancient residents of the Wabash country. The
					remainder were obtained from the Canadian archives. I have reproduced the originals as
					nearly as possible in spelling and punctuation. In translating I have endeavored to give
					the ideas that the writers, in my opinion, endeavored to convey.

					By virtue of the order of M. de Neyon, Major Commandant of the Illinois country, to
						name a person to attend to the police, and to maintain good order among the citizens of
						this post, as also of the voyageurs and the Indians-- I, invalided Captain, being about
						to depart to the Illinois country according to the order of Monsieur de Neyon have named
						Monsieur Deroite de Richardville, performing the functions of captain of militia,
						jointly with Sr. le Caindre, soldier of the troops. Their first care should be to
						maintain good feeling among the Indians to prevent disorder so long as they are in
						charge. Whenever complaint shall be made to them against any one they will proceed to
						call an assembly of the more notable of the citizens of the place, where the matter
						shall be decided by a plurality of votes.

					Messieurs Deroite de Richardville and de Caindre can not watch too carefully that the
						citizens keep up their fences, it being to the public interest that the cattle should
						not pass from the commons to the grain fields. They will check as far as they are able
						the disorders which occur too frequently, occasioned by drinking. Whenever any news
						shall come to them which may be of importance to the good of the service they will take
						care to apprise me of it. In conclusion, in all cases which I have not been able to
						foresee, I depend on their good management and their devotion to the public welfare.

					Given at Post Vincennes the 18th of May, 1764.

					REPORT OF LIEUTENANT FRASER.

					SIR-- A detail of the different occurrences of my late journey
						through the Indian Nations, cou'd neither be very entertaining, nor interesting to any
						others, but myself. At  your request Sir, I will endeavour
						to give you a discription of the countries through which I passed which is a thing
						however I should not attempt were I not confident that you will have the goodness to
						excuse any inaccuracies you may find in it whither occasion by hurry or proceeding from
						my incapacity.

					I am very sensible that my pen can not do justice to the beauties and conveniences that
						nature has bestowed on the large tract of country lying hitherto uninhabited between
						Fort Pitt & the Illinois on both sides of the Ohio.

					After traversing ninety miles of a beautiful country lying between New York &
						Philadelphia, and traveling from that place to Fort Pitt, distant 320 miles the greatest
						part peopled by very wealthy inhabitants I thought I cou'd see no other that cou'd excel
						it. I was soon convinced however of the contrary on my proceeding down the Ohio on my
						way to the Illinois. That river (very properly termed La Belle Riviere by the French
						which is the litteral translation of the Iroquois name) is formed by the confluence of
						the Allegeny & Moningahila Rivers, at Fort Pitt where they lose their names as the
						Ohio does by falling into the Missisipe about forty leagues below Fort Charters &
						almost due West from Philadelphia after running about two thousand miles in a serpentine
						course through a country abounding with an incredible quantity of game & constantly
						presenting different agreeable prospects to the Travelers view.

					Tho' this River is considerable at Fort Pitt for its size during the greatest part of
						the year, yet it is very much increas'd both in Depth and Width by the many Rivers that
						Discharge themselves into it. The most considerable of these are the Muskingum, whereon
						the Delaware live. The Canaway which comes from the back Frontiers of Virginia, the
						Scioto on whose Banks the Shawanise dwell, La Riviere de Rochers, which begins at a
						little distance  from the Miames, the Ouabache which comes
						from near the same place & the Cumberland & Cherokee Rivers which fall into it
						considerably lower. These lesser rivers are navigable for Batteaus during the greatest
						part of the year. From the middle of October to June, 8 months.

					There are no Indian Nations living contiguous to the Banks of the Ohio, but those two I
						have just mentioned The Delaw & Shaw & the Mingos or Senecas who live a little
						above Fort Pitt-- excepting those of Ouabache on which there are five nations,
						Ouiachtonons, Quicapous, Mascoutains, Piankishaw & Virmillion, settled besides a
						French Village called St. Vincent in which there are about sixty farmers who raise a
						considerable quantity of Wheat and Tobacco, and have a good stock of cattle.

					Between this River and the Illinois are several very extensive plains on which there
						are always vast numbers of Buffaloe & Deer and every other species of game common in
						that country.

					The soil in the Illinois settlements is not so good as at any of the places I have
						already named owing perhaps to the quantity of sand mixed with it by the Missisipe, the
						Inhabitants, suppose that the River overflowed formerly, all the land at present
						cultivated in that Colony & the situation with some other vestiges seem to give
						great probability to their conjecture.

					The land however is capable to produce anything which one cou'd expect in so northerly
						a climate. They raise a great deal of wheat & Indian corn, they have also most kinds
						of European fruits and vegetables, tolerably good considering the little pains they give
						themselves in cultivating them. They have attempted to rear the European vines, which
						they say they cou'd not bring to any perfection, but I impute their having given it up
						of late more to the want of skill in those who planted them, or the Monarch's
						Injunctions prohibiting the raising any thing which  might
						interfere with the staple commodities of the Northern Country. They make however a very
						bad Wine, from the natural vine of the country which grows spontaneous in every part of
						that Colony, this Wine tho' seemingly very unhealthy is sold at a most exorbitant price,
						when they have none else to drink.

					The Illinois Indians are about six hundred & fifty able to bear arms. Nothing can
						equal their passion for drunkeness, but that of the French Inhabitants, who are for the
						greatest part drunk every day while they can get Drink to buy in the Colony. They import
						more of this article from New Orleans than they do of any other, and they never fail to
						meet a speedy & good market for it. They have a good many Negroes, who are obliged
						to labour very hard to support their masters, in their extravagant Debaucheries. Any one
						that has had any dealings with them, must plainly see, they are for the most part
						transported convicts, or people who have fled for some crimes. Those who have not done
						it themselves are the offspring of such as those I just mentioned inheriting their
						Forefathers vices. They are cruel and treacherous to each other & consequently so to
						strangers. They are dishonest in every kind of Business & lay themselves out to
						overreach strangers, which they often do by a low cunning peculiar to themselves, and
						their artful flatteries with extravagant entertainments (in which they affect the
						greatest hospitality) generally favour their schemes.

					There is a rich Lead Mine in that Colony from which they get all the lead, that is
						needed in the country, and a River, the water of which (tho' fresh to the taste) they
						make a sufficiency of salt for the consumption of the Inhabitants. But these latter
						conveniences are unluckily on the Western or Spanish side of the River.

					The trade of this Country is extremely considerable, till of late years it was wholy
						monopolized by the leading  men in New Orleans, but since
						the last peace, they have allowed any one that wou'd pay the fees of a passport to go to
						our side of the River and amongst our Indians. This was a very political scheme in them,
						as every trader became a Partizan for the French in the nations we traded to, or in
						other words, the introduced those traders, who are in general most unconciencious
						Rascals and made it their interest to debauch from us such Indians as they found well
						disposed towards us-- and to foment & increase the animosity of such as the found
						otherwise; to this we shou'd alone impute our late war with the Indians, whom they
						unwarrantably supplied with ammunition and every other thing necessary for carrying it
						on. The N. O. Company for the Fur trade have confined their commerce to the Missouris
						River since, which falls in about five leagues above our most northern settlement in the
						Illinois, private traders are permitted to go every where else, and many of them come to
						our side to trade, particularly into the Illinois River from whence they get a great
						share of the trade of that Colony.

					I discovered also a few days before I left the Illinois that many traders who are
						permitted by us to come up from Canada with small quantities of goods, on their arrival
						in the Indian Nations commissions great quantities of goods from the French Merchants at
						the Illinois with which they purchase skins in the neighbourhood of our Posts &
						transport them afterwards to the Illinois-- but this I hope will be put a stop to when
						we have troops enough in that Colony to establish proper posts or enable the commander
						to send Detachments to detect any we may find committing such Frauds.

					When our traders arrive from the Post they can undersell those of the French at least
						25 per cent. for which reason you may depend Sir that they will use all their endeavours
						to create us as many enemies as possible as  they will
						have the whole trade of every Nation they can engage in a war against us. They have an
						astonishing sway over the Indians, and they will not fail to put it to the proof, to
						procure themselves Profit. In short Sir it is my humble opinion that our Countrymen at
						the Illinois will never have a real peace while they are rivals with the French in
						Trade.

					The French Commandments have always been sharers in the Profits of the New Orleans
						Company and do everything in their power to promote their common Interest. They will
						make eternal professions of Friendship and good Offices with every Englishman with whom
						they have the least intercourse, but their double manner of acting shou'd put us on
						guard to trust them as little as possible & to suspect them of doing us every harm
						possible in private. I have the honor to assure you of this Sir, from my own experience
						not from conjecture, and such as have had any business with them regarding his Majesty's
						Service must have met the same-- if any shou'd pretend to say the contrary it must
						proceed from their having mistaken their flattering protestations for sincirity so far
						as to overlook their cunning designs. I have on many occasions been flattered by them
						& had compliments paid me that I had no tittle to a consciousness of the smallness
						of my own merit convinced me that they were covers for some hidden designs & the
						Commander in Chiefs gave me sufficient precautions on this head, to keep me always on my
						guard & to supply my want of Penetration.

					You will think Sir from my account of the French in that new Colony that his Majesty
						has not made very valuable acquisition if we consider only the number of new Subjects he
						has got in that Colony, and I assure you Sir that we would be as well quit of them, if
						the Troops in that country unfortunately depend on them in a great measure for their
						provisions-- You have heard Sir how the  greatest part of
						those who inhabited our side of the River abandon it on our getting possession of the
						Colony-- Their desertion was undoubtedly occasion'd by the reports spread to paint the
						English government in as bad a light as invention cou'd frame it, but it is to be hoped,
						they will see how they have been imposed on and that so many will come back as will be
						able to supply our Troops plentifully.

					The French have had Besides Fort Charters a small Fort at Cascaskias and another at
						Coake, there was a third called Assomption on the Bank of the Ohio opposite to the mouth
						of the Cherakee River, besides two Forts on Ouabach the one called the great Ouiachtonon
						was dependant on Canada & the other at little Ouiachtonon or St Vincent-- dependant
						on Orleans all those excepting fort Charters are intirely in ruins, some of them that
						you can scarce see any appearance of they did not seem to me of any great consequence
						were they even on a better footing as they were situated. The Fort of the Natchez is
						little better, the Barracks and everything in them seem to have been destroyed through
						wantonness. I am much surprised that we have not inquired of the French their Reasons
						for abandoning them so abruptly, without giving us Regular possession of them. I took
						upon myself to ask their reasons for so doing but I could never obtain any answer,
						perhaps owing to the difficulty of giving a proper one, or perhaps they did not look
						upon me as a person of sufficient consequence to inquire into those matters.

					I forgot to mention Sir the number of Inhabitants at the Illinois and it is a thing
						which is very difficult to assertain as they are going & coming constantly to &
						from the Indian Nations, as others are from New Orleans to the Illinois, but there are
						in general about seven hundred white men able to bear arms.

					It remains only now to mention something of the  Indians
						in general. What can be said of one, may be apply'd to all, there is so great a
						similitude between them.

					The Indians are cruel, treacherous, and cowardly unless they can surprise their enemy
						without probability of suffering any loss themselves, but in that case they attack often
						ten times their own number. They are in general great Drunkards. I must except the
						Ozages nor are the Akansa or Chicasas so passionately fond of drink as other Nations
						are. These two are extremely like each other and are more remarkable for their
						attachment to the white people than any other.

					As the Chicasases have ever been faithful to us they shou'd be distinguished by our
						favours to them before any other Nation, and showing a partiality for them before other
						Indians might inspire others with a resolution of imitating their fidelity Drink is the
						occasion of all our troubles amongst them and it were much to be wished that the
						assemblies or councils of the neighbouring Provinces would restrict the sending of it,
						as has been done to the Northward. I am persuaded Sir, when you well learn the
						licentious methods of carrying on the trade amongst them, that you will use your
						endeavours to prevent the fatal consequences we shou'd dread from it. I know no body so
						proper to inform you Sir minutely regarding it as Mr. John McIntosh commissary of the
						Chickasaws you need not expect to come at the truth from any Trader,
						but you may safely trust to his information, as I know him to be a man of such honesty
						that nothing could make him conceal anything which regards his Majestys Service or which
						you would be desirous to know.

					I know no place (as I had the honour formerly to tell you Sir) where we shou'd
						establish a Fort at sooner than opposite to the mouth of the Missouris River which would
						give us the command of that River, shou'd we find it here-after beneficial & wou'd
						also put a stop to French trading  up the River, a Post at
						the mouth of the Ouabache wou'd also be necessary to command the navigation of that
						river and the Ohio, & as a store to secure provisions or goods in coming from Fort
						Pitt, shou'd it be thought hereafter more expedient to go from thence by land to Fort
						Charters.

					I think also that the mouth of the Yasou is a more proper place for a Post or
						Settlement than any other place on the Missipi, as it is the common route of the Creeks
						and Chactaws going to New Orleans.

					I beg leave to Inform you Sir that I think if we could prevail on a few Indians to live
						at the Iberville with the detachment we get there, might be very servicible in killing
						game for the Troops, and their wives & children wou'd always be good pledges for
						their Peaceable Behaviour.

					I have the honour to be with true respect Sir your most humble Servant ALE FRASER.

					Pensacola 4th May 1766.

					P. S. The Commandants of the French Troops in the Illinois were always impowered to
						prohibit the exportation of any provisions from the Illinois till the Kings Magazines
						shou'd be first supplyd. This however the comdts often permitted
						in consequence of pecuniary considerations from those who exported them I think Sir that
						your Instructions on this head to your Commanding officer there would be necessary. The
						Inhabitants might otherwise export their grain and sell it at a lower price to the
						French that we might offer them for it. I know their antipathy to our Nation would make
						them embrace with great cheerfulness any sufferings or loss should they in any manner
						tend to distress us.

					In consequence of Monsr Auburys intercession I understand by a
						letter from General Gage to him, that there are no reprisals to be made on the Indian
						Alibamons who lately, so grossly insulted us at the Iberville-- as the Tonicaws have not
						been punished either for having beat back the  22d
						Regiment, they may think that they may always expect to commit the same Hostilitie with
						impunity. I think Sir it would not be improper to signify to them that must expect to be
						all cut off shou'd they for the future give reason to suspect their good intentions-nor
						do I think it would be wrong to punish them accordingly. The Chicasaws are the Proper
						Instruments for this duty.

					ALE FRASER.

					FORT CHARTRES 15th Novr 1768.
					V.-- 15 of October.

					SIR-- Please to allow me to observe that your Exalted Station like
						many other high places in life, is not I presume free from some degree of care and
						trouble, at least so much as to deprive me of the smallest hopes of the Honour of your
						correspondence, however abstracted from the great obligation a letter from you would lay
						me under. I shall beg leave to intrude so much upon your time as may be necessary for
						the perusal of the enclosed it is a short description of the Country near (and River of)
						the Ohio from Fort Pitt to its junction with the Mississippe. You have it in the form of
						a journal wrote in haste. I flatter myself it may notwithstanding serve to assist in
						passing a few of your leisure minutes.

					I would trouble you with the Occurrences of this place, but am apprehensive that a
						detail of them would swell this letter to a tedious length, you will be pleased
						therefore to excuse the liberty I have taken in referring you to Mr Hutchinson to whom I have wrote a particulars of them.

					The Fever and Augue since our arrival has raged with such uncommon violence as to put
						it out of our power to do scarce anything more than to bury some of our Officers and Men
						who were carried off by those disorders.

					

					We expect next Spring if the Health of the Garrison permit to take possession of Post
						St Vincent on the Ouabache, if I should be furnished with any Occurrences worth your
						notice during my stay there, I shall do myself the pleasure to acquaint you with
						them.

					Colonel Wilkins who is quite recovered from his illness has desired me to present you
						with his most respectful compliments.

					It will always afford me pleasure to be favoured with your commands.

					I am with the Greatest Respect Sir, your most obedient Humble Servant THO: HUTCHINS

					JOURNAL FROM FORT PITT TO THE MOUTH OF THE OHIO.

					IN THE YEAR I768.

					The country for 71 miles below the Fort to an Indian Village situate on the north bank
						is broken with very high ridges, the valleys narrow and the course, of the River plunged
						from many high grounds which compose its banks.

					90 miles lower down is the Muskingum on the same side, in latitude 39° 19'. The
						Muskingum is a large River 250 yards wide at its confluence with the Ohio, it is said to
						be navigable 150 miles upwards with Battoes, and runs through a pleasant country as that
						near its junction appeared to be-- on this River and its branches most of the Delaware
						Indians reside.

					366 miles from Fort Pitt in Latitude 38° 22' is the Sioto River on the North Side. The
						River Ohio 50 miles above Muskingum to Sioto is most beautiful a number of Islands are
						to be seen of different sizes, but all covered with the 
						Tallest of Timber. The long reaches among which is one of 16 miles, and a 1/2 inclosed
						with the finest Trees of different kinds, of various verdures and leaves of the largest
						soils, afford a noble and enchanting prospect. The stillness of the current and a calm
						sunshine put a Trace on the Water, from which was reflected the most beautiful objects
						of simple nature, that I ever beheld. This glorious Vista was terminated by two Sugar
						Loaf Hills, of easy asscent, from which can be discovered all this magnificent variety.
						The Rivers Hockhocking & Canawba fall into the Ohio in this space, besides others of
						a smaller size, up the big Canawha the Northern Indians penetrate into the Chorakee
						Nations, and is a large fine stream by report navigable 100 miles towards the
						Southward.

					The Country is everywhere pleasant, in the bends of the River course are large levell
						spotts of the Richest Land. it is by the account of Traders remarkably Healthy.

					On the Sioto the principal part of the Shawanoe Nation have their Villages 560 miles
						below Fort Pitt, 5 miles south of the River is the Licks in which Elephants bones are
						found, the principal Lick is of a circular form, composed of a species of Quick Sand and
						Black Mud which is of a very Miry Quality. From whence these animals came, and the cause
						of their Extinction may be a subject for an able Penn to discuss. It however seems not
						improbable, but that the whole which were in this Country (by what means soever they
						were brought) kept constantly in one Herd and that arriving at the Licks in a wet
						season, and entering to satisfy their natural thirst for the salt water which arrises
						from them, some of them might by their great weight have sunk so deep as not to be able
						to rise out & the others out of sympathy, or some other cause, not being willing to
						leave their companions in distress, have shared the same fate. The pasturage near the
						Licks seems to be one of the finest kind, mixed with grass and Herbage, and well
						watered.

					

					The Ohio continues to be narrow the whole Distance from Fort Pitt to within 100 miles
						of the Falls. Its breadth seldom exceeds 500 yards and is confined by rising grounds,
						which causes many windings, altho the reaches are sometimes from 2 to 4 miles long. The
						River 100 miles above the Falls widens to 700 yards in many places, a number of Islands
						appear. The grounds diminish generally into Height, and the country is not so much
						broken-- the height of the Banks permits their being every where inhabited, nor do they
						seem subjected to crumble much away. The Little and Big Mineamies Rivers fall into below
						the Sioto on the North side, and the Licking Creek and Kentuckee on the South. There are
						many good Encampments on the Islands.

					The Falls is 682 miles below Fort Pitt in Latitude 38° 8'. This place ought rather to
						be called a Rapid, as the streams has no sudden pitch, but only Runs with inconceivable
						rapidity over the Ledge of flatt Limestone Rock, which keeps up the waters of the higher
						Ohio, and to be the cause of that beautiful stillness of the Rivers course above.

					317 miles below the Falls is the Wabash in Latitude 37° 41'. From the Falls to about
						half this distance the country is very Hilly, the course of the River very winding and
						narrow and the Hills are mostly strong and steep.

					837 miles below Fort Pitt the Ridgy ground disappears, the country grows flat and the
						River whose Bed widens is often divided by Islands. The River Wabash at its confluence
						is 300 yds. wide and Issues in with a considerable quantity of water of a muddy kind, it
						is navigable between 3 & 400 miles upwards. Post St Vincent a French Village is
						situate 6o leagues up it and nearly the same distance further up stands the Village of
						Ouiatanon. The Following Indian Nations reside on this River, Vizt. Ouiatanons Kickapoos
						Pyankashaws, and Musquetons.

					

					The country between the course of this River and that of the Mississipi is general
						Flatt, open and of a rich luxurient soil, and that on the Banks of the Ohio is level,
						and in many places overflowed here abouts.

					120 miles below the mouth of the Wabash and 11 below that of the Cherokee River is the
						remains of the Fort Massiac, formerly a French Post.

					The country 25 miles from the Wabash begins again to be mountainous being the N. W. end
						of the Apalachian Mountains which entirely terminate a small distance from the River
						Northernly.

					45 miles below Massiac and 1164 from Fort Pitt is the mouth of the Ohio in Latitude 36°
						43'. The gentle Ohio is pushed back by the impetuous stream of the Mississipi whose
						muddy white water is to be seen 200 yards up the Former. The ground for some miles
						within the Fork is an aggregation of mud and sand interspersed with marsh and some ponds
						of water, and is in high times of the Mississipi over flowed which is the case with the
						other sides of both rivers. THO. HUTCHINS.

						qu'il ne luy fui pas encore parvenue puis qu'il ne put estre party des Illinois qu'au
						commencement de Septembre. Il a été fait tel qu'etoit la formal que Monsieur le general
						Gage nous envoya et qu'il recommendait suivre exactement.

					Nous y avons joinn le cértifficat de Mr St
						Ange qui a longtemps commander en ce poste au nom du Roy de France légalizé par Mr Pierre Nasse, commendent en chef a St Louis
						et de Mr le Capitaine Laird qui a bien voulue se charger du tout
						pour le faire parvenir a Monsieur le general Gage n'etent pas prevenue que Vostre
						Excelence gouvernoit en sa place.

					Nous sommes tres persuadé que des affaires ainsi mal en ordre ne pouroit avoir qu'un
						tres meauvais succes si nous n'avions pas la plus ferme confience dans les vertues de
						vostre Excelence et sous la protection de laquelle nous nous metons; et comme c'est les
						propres des grandes ames de s'interesser pour un peuple malheureux, nous la supplions de
						nous estre favorable et faire chouze digne d'elle et ne cesserons de faire des veux pour
						sa prosperite.

					J'ay l'honneur d'estre avec un tres profond respect

					Monsieur
					Vostre tres humble et tres obeissant serviteur
					STE MARIE

					Au Poste Vincennes le 3e May 1774.

					(Translation.)

					MONSIEUR-- I am too full of respect for all that bears the imprint
						of authority to have neglected to make reply to that which your Excellence informs me
						you wrote me after  the departure of Monsieur General
						Gage. This is the only one which Monsieur Maisonville has sent me, to which I reply with
						all possible respect.

					To make a more correct reply to that with which Monsieur General Gage honored us, and
						to the proclamation which he sent us under date of April 8, 1773, I was obliged to make
						the trip to the Illinois with Mr. Perthuit (Perthwaite?), who was sent to attend to this
						matter, because a part of the title-deeds of this place were in the archives of that
						post, another part carried away by a M. Clouvier, former notary, whose bad conduct
						obliged him to depart secretly, others were eaten by rats etc.

					In regard to the verification (of titles) which your Excellence requires of us, it is
						not surprising that it has not yet reached you, for it could not be started from the
						Illinois before the beginning of September. It has been made according to the form which
						Monsieur General Gage sent us, and which he recommended us to follow exactly.

					We have joined to it the certificate of Monsieur St. Ange, who commanded at this post
						for a long time in the name of the King of France, authenticated by Monsieur Piernas,
						commandant in chief at St. Louis, and of Monsieur Captain Lord, who indeed offered to
						see that it reached Monsieur General Gage, not being aware that your Excellence governed
						in his place.

					We are indeed convinced that affairs in such bad order could not have other than very
						poor success, if we did not have the greatest confidence in the virtues of your
						Excellence, and under the protection of whom we put ourselves; and as it is the
						characteristic of great souls to interest themselves for an unfortunate people, we
						supplicate you to be favorable to us, and to do as is worthy of you, and we will never
						cease to offer prayers for your prosperity.

					

					I have the honor to be, with very profound respect, Monsieur,

					Your very humble and very obedient servant
					STE. MARIE.
					Post Vincennes, May 3, 1774.

					GENERAL HALDIMAND TO GENERAL GAGE.
					N. YORK, le 5 Jan. 1774.
					MON.-- Je viens enfin de recevoir une lettre de Cape Lord des Illinois daté du 3e Sepre m'envoyer le
						recensement  (ou plutot les noms) de 88 habitans qui sont
						etabli au Post Vincene. Cette piece est accompagné d'un certificat de M. St Ange qui y a
						commandé pendant plusieurs années, et qui dit avoir été authorisée par les differents
						Gouv de la Louisianne, de conceder des Terrains dans les endroits la. Mais la plupart de
						ces titres sont perdu, soit par accident ou par la mauvaise conduite d'un notaire de
						l'endroit, de sorte qu'il y a plusieurs de ces habitans qui n'ont d'autre titres que
						celui de possession, et comme il serait tres difficile de leur disputer, le meilleur
						serait peutetre de les laisser tranquille, mais de leur donner quelqu'un pour les
						conduire. Quoique la malle doit se fermer ce soir je tacherai d'envoyer les pieces au
						compte de Dartmouth, me persuadant que vous vous prenderez quelqu' arrangement pour les
						Illinois pendant cet hiver. Le Capne Lord me manque que deux
						habitans Francais ont (a l'example de Mons. Murray) achete toute le terrain appartenant
						a une des tribus des Illinois, qui etait autrefois tres nombreuses et qui se trouve
						reduite aujourd'hui à douze Guerriers. J'ai toute lieu de crois que les deux Francais ne
						sont que les Agents de la meme compagnie qui achete la premier terrain, et il est facile
						de prevoir qu'il y aura dans peu beaucoup de desordre dans ces cotes la, si on n'y porte
						une prompte remede, habitans s'etabli augmente et a que jours la fureur.

					Je profitais de l'occasion du L'Ellis qui partit Dimanche dernier pour vous savoir la
						mort de Commissaire Lake, enfin que si vous avez dessein de servir quelques une de vos
						amis vous puissiez le faire. J'annonce cet vacance au Secretaire de la Guerre par ce
						pacquet et en attendant que la volonte du Roi soit connu j'ai nomme le Cape Hutchinson pour faire la fonction de Mons. Lake avec ordre de
						continuer tout les personnes employe dans cette affaire, afin que les choses continent
						dans l'ordre ou elles ont été j'usqua present.

					Dans le retour de l'etat Maj. outre mon Aide de Camp,

					Depuis les nouvelles que vous aurez recues par le Cape Cowper il
						ne s'est rien passe d'extraordinaire et je compte que le vaisseau qui apporte le Thé
						n'occasionera pas des desordre, on parait bien determiner à le faire reporter sans

					(Translation.)
					NEW YORK, Jan. 5, 1774.

					MONSIEUR-- I have at length received a letter from Captain Lord, of
						the Illinois, dated September 3d, transmitting to me the verification (or rather the
						names) of 88 citizens who are established at Post Vincennes. This document is
						accompanied by a certificate of M. St. Ange, who commanded there for many years, and who
						says he had been authorized by the different governors of Louisiana to concede lands in
						that locality. But the most of these title-deeds are lost, either by accident or by the
						bad conduct of a notary of the place, so that there are many of these citizens who have
						no other title than that of possession, and as it will be very difficult to controvert
						them, it will probably be better to let them remain, but to send some one to govern
						them. Although the mail ought to close this evening, I will endeavor to forward the
						documents to Lord Dartmouth, believing that you will adopt some arrangement for the
						Illinois during this winter.  Captain Lord informs me that
						two French citizens have (after the manner of Mr. Murray) bought all the land belonging
						to one of the tribes of the Illinois, who were formerly very numerous and who are now
						reduced to a dozen warriors. I have every reason to believe that the two Frenchmen are
						nothing but agents of the same company which bought the first land, and it is easy to
						foresee that there will be in a little while much disorder in those parts if a remedy is
						not promptly provided; the settlers will establish themselves, increase, and some day
						there will be trouble.

					I availed myself of the opportunity to write you by Lt. Ellis, who left last Sunday, to
						let you know of the death of Commissary Lake, in order that if you desired to serve some
						of your friends you might be able to do so. I announce this vacancy to the Secretary of
						War by this mail, and until the pleasure of the King shall be known I have appointed
						Captain Hutchinson to perform the duties of Mr. Lake, with orders to continue all the
						persons employed in this business, in order that affairs may keep in the same situation
						that they have been to the present.

					In the return of the staff in addition to my aide-de-camp, I have appointed another for
						duty in America, and whom I will pay by a warrant.

					Since the news that you received by Captain Cowper nothing extraordinary has occurred,
						and I think that the vessel which brings the tea will not occasion disorder, indeed they
						appear to have decided to take it back quietly.

					Lady Dunmore arrived yesterday with a legion of children. She will have trouble in
						continuing her journey, the weather being very bad. My compliments to Madame, etc.

					I have the honor--

					I beg you to present My Lord Gage my respects and to say to him that I have delivered
						in good time the letters to Mr. Campbell which he sent in my care. I congratulate you on
						having been able to serve Mr. Kemble. I hear that his commission as "naval officer" has
						arrived.

									Rapids, otherwise than by being dragged over the stones & frequently the
									Traders are obliged to carry their goods the whole eighteen miles.

					10Post Ouiatanon-- After
							careful study of authorities and maps I located this fort "on the north bank of the
							Wabash," "a short distance above Indian creek, which the French called Rivière de
							Boisrouge." About five months after my "Indiana" was published, in February 1889, some
							workmen who were taking gravel from a bank near the river, about four miles above
							Indian creek, found the remains of a French officer, as appeared from parts of the
							uniform still existing. From this and other remains, silver crucifixes, utensils of
							various kinds, etc., many of which are now preserved at Purdue University, the site of
							the fort was identified. (Lafayette Call, Feb. 12 and Feb. 19, 1889.) The location was
							afterwards confirmed by Mrs. Berilla Smith, an aged lady, who came to that region in
							1831, and had the site of the old fort pointed out to her by earlier settlers.
							(Lafayette Call, March 11, 1892.) It is nearly opposite-- slightly below-- the mouth
							of Wea creek, near Sand Ridge church.

					LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR ABBOTT, SUPERINTENDENT, TO SIR GUY
							CARLETON.

					SIR-- I have the honor of acquainting your Excellency of my arrival
						the i9th inst; the short time and trouble with the Indians &c has not permitted my
						taking a general Review of the affairs of this district; since the conquest of Canada,
						no person bearing His Majesty's Commission has been to take possession; from this your
						Excellency may easily imagine what anarchy reigns.

					I must do the inhabitants justice for the respectfull reception I met with, and for
						their readiness in obeying the orders I thought necessary to issue.

					The Wabache is perhaps one of the finest rivers in the world, on its banks are several
						Indian Towns, the most considerable is the Ouija, where it is said there are 1000 men
						capable to bear arms, I found them so numerous, and needy, I could not pass without
						great expense; The presents though very large, were in a manner despised, saying their
						antient Father (the french) never spoke to them without a barnfull of goods; having no
						Troops and only a handfull of french obliged me to esquiese in part of their exorbitand
						demands, which has occationed a much greater expense than I could have imagined, but I
						believe it not  thrown away, as I left them seemingly well
						disposed for His Majesty's service.

					I have drawn on Mr Dunn for seven thousand five hundred and
						thirty two Pounds six shillings and tenpence halfpenny New York currency and request
						your Excellency will order payment, I have likewise took the Liberty of drawing on Mr
						Dunn for 6428 Livres in favour of Jean Baptiste Racine dit St
						Marie, who has acted as commandant of this place since it was conceded to His Majesty.
						The fair character he bears with the certificate annexed to his account makes me think
						it just; I hope your Excellency will excuse the incorrectness of this as I am every
						minute call'd away and have not a moment to myself; I beg leave to mention Mr Edgar the bearer of this who has had a great deal of trouble, paid
						all the expences of Government without the least gratification and without whom I could
						not have kept the accounts in any order from the multiplicity of affairs, I offered him
						payment which he refused, he came with me to see the country and can much better inform
						you of it than I can who was continually employed-- I shall send off in a few days
						towards Fort Pitt to see what is doing there; I enclose a note sent me from Monsr Rocheblave which shews the Spaniards intention toward us and which
						corresponds with other intelligence I have had. By the nex opportunity I hope to have it
						in my power to send a circumstantial account of this place, I must not neglect
						mentioning a Mr Ramsey who has been here about nine years ago from
						the Illinois. I would beg your Excellency would give me orders concerning the land at
						this place for few of them have any proper grants though possessed near thirty
						years.

					I have the honor to be with respect
					your Excellency's most obedient Huml Servt
					(Signed)
						EDWARD ABBOTT
					Lieut Governor & Superintendant of St Vincennes

					

					As it is necessary for a commissary of Indian affairs at this
							place I cou'd wish your Excellency wou'd approve of Mr
							Edgar a person well qualified for it.

					His Excellency Sir Guy Carleton.

					Indorsed:-- Copy of a Letter from Lieut.
					Governor Abbott Superintendant
					dated St Vincennes
					26th May 1777.
					In Sir Guy Carleton's (No. 32)
