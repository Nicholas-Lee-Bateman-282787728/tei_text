                    </placeName>'s transition from pioneer village to urban community can be traced in the
                    economic developments which occurred there from 1830 to 1860. From its initial settlement in 1813
                    through the 1820's, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> possessed the establishments common to most small frontier towns: a few general stores,
                    a mill or two, and a number of small shops where blacksmith, saddler, cobbler, and other local
                    artisans plied their trade on a limited scale.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> With the steady increase of
                    population and extension of the town's boundaries came a corresponding growth in its
                    economic activities, marked by an increase in the exchange of farm commodities, the acceleration and
                    variation of mercantile activities, the evolution of a more elaborate fiscal and banking system, and
                    at least the beginnings of a complex industrial establishment.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    activity, as in most settlements in the West, was merchandising—trading, buying, and
                    selling. The town was not endowed with a particularly rich rural neighborhood, but its position on
                    the river made it a natural rendezvous for farmers of the surrounding counties and prospective
                    buyers of their goods. A fundamental strategy of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> merchants was the extension of the town's hinterland far beyond the confines

                        <region type="county">Floyd County</region>
                    </placeName> so that its advantages as a trade center for farm produce could be fully realized.
                    Prior to 1830 the limitations of transportation had prevented this program from advancing far, but
                    road improvements and the creation of a rail connection within the next three decades enabled <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s commercial development were encompassed within this thirty-year period. In
                    the early 1830's the local market house and the general store dominated the commercial
                    scene; by the late 1830's wholesaling had become noticeably important, though not yet equal
                    to retailing; and by 1860 wholesaling was the dominant enterprise.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>

                    early 1830's was a wide, open shed placed in the middle of unpaved Market Street where
                    farmers from Floyd and neighboring counties gathered twice a week to dispose of their produce. The
                    screaming of hucksters, the symphony of a dozen different barnyard voices, the atmosphere of
                    smells—some wholesome, some otherwise—the trampling through refuse and offal,
                    the scuffle to get the best bargains—all this was the market house.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            </p>
            <p>About fifty stalls were leased to regular vendors for "not less than ten dollars,"
                    the remaining space being rented on the basis of sales.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Attempts to short
                    weigh, misrepresent quality, sell tainted or damaged goods, or otherwise defraud were subject to
                    fines of five dollars. To prevent eager traders from buying up the best produce, no articles brought
                    to and usually sold in market could be sold from twilight on market eve until sounding of the market
                    bell at five o'clock the next morning. During market hours all transactions were restricted
                    to the market area, but there was little to prevent prospective sellers and buyers from meeting
                    outside the town limits to carry on their exchange uninhibited by town regulations. The marketmaster
                    was the ruler of this compact commercial domain. After market hours he might have to sweep up the
                    debris remaining from the feverish three-hour activity, but most of his duties were more dignified.
                    He leased the stalls, opened the market by ringing the courthouse bell, tried to insure fairness in
                    transactions, and generally presided over the manifold proceedings.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

                    </placeName> for at least the remainder of the century. Later it was not only necessary to enlarge
                    the original market house but to construct an additional one in the uptown section of the expanding
                    city as well.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> But as the town became more urbanized the public markets served

                        About 1836 the market space was extended to include the block between State and Lower (West)
                        First streets, this being termed the "lower" market. This second area is still
                        used for display and sale of farm produce. Some time later an uptown market space was laid out
                        on Upper (East) Market between Tenth and Eleventh streets. This block is now the site of a local

                            to consider this as a personal dun. I have indulged you as long as I can without suffering

                    southern Indiana trade, and by the middle 1850's their town was recognized as a wholesale
                    center. Though promoters declared that wholesaling "may be considered in its
                    infancy," they published these rather impressive statistics for the year 1856: <table>

                    further evidenced in the development of two other phases of mercantile activity: the first, which
                    defies exact classification, may be termed "warehousing"; the other, a business
                    common in many river towns of this region, was hog slaughtering. The building of the <placeName>

                    commission and forwarding agents, maintaining warehouses and charging fees for receiving, storing,
                    and shipping accumulated stores to distant river markets. As early as the mid-1830's a few
                    merchants engaged in this practice, probably as a sideline; by the 1850's <list type="footnotes">

            <p>One of the most perplexing problems affecting commercial activities in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as in hundreds of other western communities in this era, was the acute shortage of
                    money. There was simply not enough negotiable currency in the Northwest to keep pace with the rapid
                    expansion within the region. So long as exchanges of goods were on a relatively minor scale the
                    money shortage could be somewhat alleviated by the extensive use of barter. As late as the
                    1830's and 1840's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> tradesmen still took a large portion of their pay in produce, especially in such
                    non-perishable items as flax and tow linen, ginseng, beeswax, feathers, and dried fruit. But by the
                    1850's the volume of trade had outmoded this practice, and transactions were almost
                    exclusively for cash.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> As barter disappeared paper money came more into
                    prominence, and the question of what was "good" and what was
                    "bad" paper plagued buyer and seller alike.</p>
            <p>Part of a state-wide program to bring some relief from the fiscal difficulties was the establishment
                    in 1834 of the Second State Bank of Indiana.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> The local branch of this system,
                    one of twelve, was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s first formal banking house. It served principally as an exchange office, but
                    its initial prosperity shortly gave it a significant place in the commercial affairs of the town.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> As was its intent, this bank doubtless fostered business and brought a kind
                    of order out of the fiscal chaos. On the other hand, the means by which it achieved its early
                    success were frequently open to criticism because much of its profit came from discounting bills
                    from interior branches of the state system. Often when a farmer or other outsider brought his own

                    contributing to the general slowdown in business. Prevented by charter regulations from charging

                    while at least, helped to alleviate this situation. These were the Farmers' and

                    steamboats, employed a large number of hands. The 1840 census lists fifty-eight engaged in making

            <p>An industry which appeared and disappeared in the 1850's was the manufacture of

                    </placeName> might have had some future as a manufacturing center for mechanical farm equipment had
                    this enterprise been developed. By 1855 the John B. Ford Company had produced five thousand Sanford
                    Strawcutters which sold for a total of $75,000. It employed forty workers and had a
                    weekly payroll of $350.00. Agencies of the company, all of which were supplied from the <placeName>

                    </placeName> shop, were established in seven midwestern states. Ford and his colleagues planned to
                    add the manufacture of several other agricultural implements to the business and intended
                    "making it, if they meet proper success, one of the largest factories in the
                        west."<hi rend="sup">57</hi> The factory did not become one of the largest in the West,
                    but John B. Ford eventually took up other pursuits and became one of the nation's most
                    successful industrialists.<hi rend="sup">58</hi>

            <p>Another trade which reached near-factory proportions by the late 1850's was coopering, which
                    became a subsidiary enterprise of Simpson and Company, the town's leading meat packer. In
                    1858 this concern established a shop where workers built 50,000 barrels and several thousand
                    hogsheads a year. The <hi rend="i">Ledger</hi> reported that "nearly all the operations are

                    the whole good or bad for the town's future is debatable. But there was no apparent doubt
                    on the part of those who considered themselves in these years the custodians of the town's
                    destiny.</p>

                    </placeName>'s youthful, perhaps adolescent, years. The small river town was swept by the
                    events and trends, mostly uncontrollable, which were molding the state of Indiana and the Old
                    Northwest some hundred years ago. In retrospect, much of <placeName>

                    town's boosters—this was in reality a period of small operations. Commercial
                    activities and opportunities were geared to a sparsely populated and relatively undeveloped
                    hinterland. <list type="footnotes">

                    it was not the rich man who gambled on a trek to the frontier to pit his future with a youthful
                    community. Mechanization and factories, at least in this region, were almost a generation removed.
                    In these years <placeName>

                    </placeName> could boast that it was one of the largest "cities" in Indiana; yet
                    it had as late as 1860 only about 12,000 inhabitants. It could justly claim to be one of the
                    important emporiums of the state; yet its business was never more than a small fraction of that of
                    its cross-river neighbor, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>

                    And though there was a keen desire on the part of its directing citizens to maintain this
                    pre-eminence for their city, unforeseen obstacles were to prevent these ambitions from being carried
                    out in the exact manner their holders anticipated.</p>

                    </placeName> during Woodrow Wilson's two terms, Thomas Riley Marshall
                    (1854–1925) earned his livelihood and his reputation by speaking. He defended clients,
                    won votes, and exhorted the populace to support the nation's efforts in World War I. Though
                    little remembered by the American public today, Marshall achieved national prominence in the first
                    quarter of this century. His speeches on special occasions in such cities as <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>, <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>,
                            <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> were heard by large and sometimes distinguished audiences.</p>
            <p>The political speaking in which Marshall participated was restricted to support for the Democratic
                    party and its candidates and to his own campaign oratory. He was never a candidate for membership in
                    a legislative body. In three of his four contests he was elected to office; his only defeat was in a
                    campaign for the office of prosecuting attorney in Indiana's thirty-third judicial
                    district. His two successful candidacies for the vice presidency cannot be considered personal
                    victories because of Woodrow Wilson's strong leadership and popularity. However, the
                    gubernatorial campaign of 1908 in Indiana provided adequate testimony to the effectiveness of
                    Marshall's persuasive speaking and eventually changed him from a small town lawyer to Vice
                    President of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Marshall's nomination as the Democratic candidate for governor of Indiana was the result of
                    his loyalty to the party. Like his father before him, he gave devoted service to the Democratic
                    cause, working for it and its candidates in local contests; like his father, he seemed satisfied to
                    fill this role without personal ambition for public office.</p>

                    eight or ten platforms had been erected for the party orators. Here Marshall made his first public
                    political speech. His classmates boosted him onto a platform where he spoke on the issues of the
                        day.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Although he remembered this experience with pride, most of his
                    undergraduate political activities were confined to the campus. Occasionally Marshall served as one

            <p>A speech before the Democratic Editorial Association of Indiana on June 24, 1884, brought him his

            <p>The vituperation that was becoming a trademark of the lawyer's speeches pleased the
                    Democratic editors and the Young Democrats when it was turned against the Republicans whose
                    "fondest boast" was "the insulting, spitting upon and mocking of manhood
                    because it dwelt South of Mason and Dixon's line." This description was offered in
                    contrast to "the refulgent splendor of Tilden and Hendricks" and the young
                    Democrats who, "like young Achilles standing picket guard," are "heroes
                    of an hundred hard fought battles for Constitutional rights—battles as all important to
                    the world as Runnymede." Displayed in the speech was a veneration of the Constitution (a
                    dominant theme in Marshall's speeches) as well as the zeal of a young party stalwart.</p>
            <p>Marshall's party strength grew, but his activities were confined largely to his own
                    Congressional district. He was, for example, chairman of the Twelfth District Democratic Committee
                    in 1896 and 1898 and made speeches throughout the northern section of the state.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> In 1906 he was asked to run for Congress from his district but declined because he was
                    afraid of being elected and had "strong personal reasons" for not going to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Mainly, he feared that in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> he could not, on a congressman's salary, give his wife the sort of life she
                        wanted.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> The spark of ambition was present, however; years previously he had

            <p>The recognized party leader in Indiana, Thomas Taggart, had been a force in national Democratic
                    politics for a generation because Indiana's doubtful vote often helped to determine the
                    outcome of national elections. Despite Taggart's leadership serious revolts sometimes
                    occurred in the ranks of the state organization. In 1908 a clash in the Seventh District between
                    Taggart and <placeName>

                    more than a receptive candidate whose original supporters were staying with him on every ballot.
                    This situation prevailed through the fourth ballot when Taggart forced Ralston to withdraw from the
                    race. With the eye of the practical politician, Taggart had seen that Slack was going to win unless
                    Ralston's votes were given to Marshall.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    throughout the balloting, and the enmities between the factions had not been dispelled. As the
                    nominee began to speak, the delegates were on their feet and pressing forward. He began with
                    "a halting voice and plainly with an effort at self-control,"<hi rend="sup">15</hi> but he quickly regained his composure. Then "the eager men in front heard a speech
                    of acceptance such as few of them had ever listened to." Short and thin, the man did not
                    look impressive, but he could talk—"he knew just what to say."</p>
            <p>He did know "just what to say," for in his opening sentences he established his own

                    emotionally reunited the party; many "that might not have been for him" supported
                    him because of this speech.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Both anti-Taggart and Taggart men joined in the
                    chorus, and the party harmony that prevailed foreshadowed a successful campaign.</p>
            <p>Congressman James E. Watson was nominated the Republican candidate for governor in 1908 when that
                    party was also plagued with internal strife; but unlike the Democrats the Republicans had been
                    unable to heal the rift before the campaign.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> This was of some advantage to
                    Marshall, for the voters broke party lines when the major issue of the campaign became the
                    temperance question.</p>
            <p>The Republican state platform contained a plank that called for the control of the sale of liquor on
                    a county option basis; that is, if any county voted "dry," no liquor could be sold
                    anywhere within its borders. Because the rural vote was dry and could generally outvote the county
                    seats and other towns, nearly nine-tenths of the counties of the state would vote dry under this
                    system. The Democrats were also for local option, but the local unit favored by them was the city,
                    ward, or township. Obviously the number of taverns would be greater under the latter plan. Upon the
                    local option issue the major battle lines were drawn, and presumably the election would determine
                    whether the county or the township would be the local unit.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Watson, recognizing his strongest argument, devoted the bulk of his speeches to the liquor

                    </placeName> and continued without pause until November 1. Marshall claimed that his 169 speeches
                    represented the most strenuous campaign ever made in the state.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> This
                    information alone refutes the latter part of the statement by Marshall's biographer that
                    "the spirit of resignation that came with maturity led him to do nothing to obtain the
                    nomination, and once nominated less than is usually done to win the election."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> The assistant secretary of the Democratic State Committee in 1908 remembered
                    that "he believed he won because it was foreordained that he should be
                        Governor."<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Marshall's Presbyterian fatalism must have
                    prepared him for any eventuality, but "resignation" and
                    "foreordination" were nevertheless given every encouragement to operate
                    successfully.</p>
            <p>Marshall believed that he and the Democrats could win if their message were brought to a sufficient
                    number of voters. He was fully aware of the odds against him, however, and of the strength of the
                    Republicans who had controlled the state for twelve years. Since James Watson, the Republican
                    nominee, was a polished orator and known to the electorate because of his seven terms in
                        Congress,<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Marshall knew that he would have to build his own reputation
                    through his speeches. For these reasons "he did not dare to overlook a single crossing of
                    two country roads in his `whirlwind' speech-making tour of the Hoosier State."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Obviously this remark cannot be accepted literally, but Marshall did speak
                    over the entire state.</p>

                    wife chatted with the local ladies about her family and theirs; the men discussed seriously the

            <p>If the party workers were energetic and could expect a good turnout, a torchlight parade wound

                    entered into the spirit of the moment with words of encouragement—`You'll be

                    rhetorical questions. Despite the major distraction of a severe drought that lasted from the middle

            <p>At the speech in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> Marshall's listeners had been principally Democrats waiting to hear his
                    interpretation of their platform, but later audiences included doubting Republicans,
                    Prohibitionists, and independents, as well as Democrats. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> he had spoken against the past record and printed platform of the Republican party, but
                    soon Watson and others were to speak and their charges had to be countered. Marshall, experienced as
                    debater and lawyer, adapted his techniques of argument and rebuttal to the heterogeneous audiences
                    as well as to the special methods of attack by the opposition.</p>
            <p>The Republicans established their main argument early in the campaign. Watson, the Republican
                    nominee, in his opening speech of the active campaign at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, announced: "The real question in Indiana this year, the `paramount
                    issue' is, shall the brewers dominate Indiana politics, or shall the people
                        rule?"<hi rend="sup">33</hi> That is, would there be township option and thus saloons
                    in nearly every town as the Democrats wanted, or would "the people rule" by voting
                    Republican and gaining county control of the sale of liquor.</p>
            <p>The brewers themselves added fuel to this argument by contributing openly and freely to the
                    Democratic cause.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Public denials by party officials did not stem the
                    criticism, and Republicans estimated that the brewers' fund had reached a million dollars
                    before the campaign began.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> The Republicans needed only to associate Marshall
                    with these events to create a seemingly unassailable position from which to attack. To support their
                    stand widespread rumors were spread that he was not a "sober man." The charges
                    became so acrimonious that the minister of the Presbyterian church in <placeName>

                    </placeName> City, the Rev. Alexander D. Sutherland, arose to Marshall's defense:
                    "Mr. Marshall is not only not a drunkard, but on the contrary is a total abstainer; a
                    practical, consistent temperance man, yet not a hypocrit nor a fanatic."<hi rend="sup">36</hi> The problem that faced Marshall was how to maintain his own integrity and support his
                    party's platform while at the same time disclaiming the aid the brewers were giving to the
                    party.</p>

            <p>One of the chief means of persuasion for a speaker is the personal or ethical appeal he has with an
                    audience. Marshall sometimes defended his character by a direct denial of the opposition's
                    attacks. At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for example, he tried to clarify his personal position: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I am not the brewer's candidate for Governor of Indiana. Not a dollar has been
                            raised for me by any brewer… . I have not a dollar of any man's money in

                            blacksmiths' candidate, the preachers' candidate nor the Anti-Saloon
                            League candidate. I am the candidate of the Democratic party and I stand upon its
                                platform.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Marshall was proud of his freedom from special interests, and he often varied the above remarks by
                    telling his audiences how much the campaign was costing him. This figure was $3,750 by
                    the end of the campaign; nearly $2,000 was spent for travel and $1,800 was
                    donated to the party at the request of the state committee. He accepted no contributions for his
                    travel or living expenses and continued this policy in future campaigns so as to avoid obligation to
                    financial supporters.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another kind of ethical appeal brought a reprimand from the state committee. In the opening
                    statements of his speeches Marshall usually said: "If you think I would not make a good
                    Governor of Indiana, it is your duty to vote against me. If you think I would make a good Governor,
                    it is your duty to vote for me." This was not approved as practical politics, but he
                    ignored the advice to eliminate these remarks and in so doing probably contributed to the impression
                    of honesty and sincerity.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Those remarks seemed as naïve at that
                    time as they do today, but they only reinforced the candidness for which he became noted.</p>
            <p>A speaker's physical appearance also affects a listener's reaction to a speech, and
                    in the case of Tom Marshall this was not a positive factor. He was not a commanding figure and

                    "a lean and malarial Hoosier," and "the storekeeper at Pumpkin
                    Center" were epithets applied in the attempts to describe this "typical"
                    Hoosier's appearance. Although he had never farmed or lived on a farm, there was a homespun
                    flavor about him and he somehow gave the impression that he should be exchanging stories with
                    cronies in a country store.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was a small man, weighing about 125 pounds, with iron-gray hair, a large head, predominant ears,
                    and a bushy mustache that almost hid his mouth. Yet, on closer inspection, an observer could see
                    that he was well groomed and had a certain dignity of appearance. One reporter after interviewing
                    Marshall detailed him in fashion-plate manner: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>You would not guess it from his photographs, but he is urbane, from his well-cut locks to his
                            small, well-shod foot and the tips of his perfectly manicured fingers. The taste that
                            selects his ties transcends all criticism. Robert Chambers and other authorities on details
                            of the personal proprieties would describe the Hoosier Governor's clothes as
                            `well-built' and himself as `well-groomed.' To silence the slanders of the
                            camera, it remains only to note the Phi Beta Kappa key (of unusual weight and elegance) on
                            his fob, the ring on his finger, the stick in the gloved hand, the large, round, real,
                            tortoise-shell spectacles which add distinction while they relieve the wearied eye of the
                                wearer.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

            <p>Marshall was not a formidable or a handsome figure; he was "picturesque," and his
                    appearance probably did not contribute to his prestige with an audience. When he began to speak,
                    however, what he said and how he said it overcame any doubts that might have been caused by his
                    physical characteristics. The comments about Marshall's voice and delivery indicate that he
                    persuaded some listeners because of his effective presentation of arguments.</p>

            <p>Mainly, the speaker's delivery gave the impression of sincerity. This direct and unaffected

                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> early in September of 1908: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>A man with a bull dog jaw, every line of his countenance showing vigor, determination and

                            the stage at the People's theater last night to receive the plaudits of a great

                            plexus force. Before he was done he had conquered the doubters, had won applause from

            <p>His voice was variously labeled as clear, penetrating, forceful, pleasant, and musical. It was well
                    modulated and in the campaign it was to prove adequate for stump speaking out of doors. Although he
                    never shouted, the force of his voice amazed some: "in fact, when he lets it out into full
                    sway one wonders where such a small man can keep all the noise stored up."<hi rend="sup">44</hi> His gestures were natural and those who heard him speak were not distracted by extremes of
                    physical action. "He never sawed the air,"<hi rend="sup">45</hi> but photographs
                    and occasional reports about his delivery depict him with arms extended and using a pointed finger
                    for punctuation and emphasis.</p>
            <p>Years of experience had created the easy, natural, yet forceful delivery for which Marshall became
                    noted, but his effortless fluency amazed some of his auditors, causing one woman to turn to Mrs.

                    did lack histrionics. The chief contribution of this direct, conversational manner was the
                    impression of sincerity. When audiences left his speeches in the 1908 campaign, they were convinced
                    that this man placed loyalty to country, state, and political party above personal desire.</p>
            <p>It was the task of both candidates to deal with the issues of the campaign in the most persuasive
                    manner possible, and numerous pre-election activities increased the tempo of the political conflict.
                    For example, in the midst of the campaigning both candidates had to shift their arguments on the
                    liquor question because of a special session of the state legislature. Governor J. Frank Hanly, the
                    Republican incumbent, called the representatives and senators together on September 18 and eight
                    days later the Republican majority passed a county option law. Watson opposed this tactic but was
                    forced to support it.18 Marshall immediately leaped to the attack, and the day before the session
                    was to convene he spoke at Rock-port: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Governor Hanly is a shining example of one-man power. Governor Hanly goes on the old despotic
                            theory that the King can do no wrong. He does not grant to the people of this State the
                            right to think and decide for themselves, but sets himself up as their dictator to tell them
                            what they must do and what they must not do. He measures all things and all persons by his
                            own ideas. This I contend is a violation of constitutional government, for under a
                            constitutional government the people themselves rule.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

            <p>Even when he was speaking on other issues, Marshall applied his wit against the special session. At <placeName>

                    </placeName>, for example, he was questioning the brief financial statement issued by the
                    Republicans. He compared it to a report made by "the trustees of Paw Paw Township to the
                    honorable board of commissioners" which read "All paid in and all paid
                    out."</p>

            <p>Marshall was not as successful at self-control on another occasion. He anticipated the opposition of
                    all the "dry" forces on the liquor question, but when the churches gave voice to

            <p>Fortunately for Marshall he was able to apply his wit with less abuse and more success as a
                    persuasive device during the remainder of the campaign. Two further examples demonstrate this.
                    Throughout the campaign he said that it was the governor's duty to sign all the bills the
                    legislature passed unless there was doubt as to their constitutionality. Watson asked in one of his
                    speeches if that meant that Marshall would sign bills to legalize murder and gambling if the
                    legislature should pass them. Marshall quickly replied to this absurdity in like manner: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Mr. Watson asks me if I will sign such bills if a Republican Legislature passes
                            them… . All I have to say is that Mr. Watson certainly has a very poor opinion of
                            the Republican candidates for the Legislature if he thinks they will pass such bills.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> He clarified his support of the township option law with similar levity: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I am a believer in local self-government. I believe that no man has a right to call in his
                            neighbor to help him lick his wife until he finds he can't lick her himself.</p>
                        <p>I don't talk to Democrats this year. … It is not necessary. I have been
                            in fifty counties of Indiana and every Democrat I have met has had a smile on his face just
                            such as he had when he kissed his wife for the first time.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This form of audience adaptation was accompanied by more direct appeals. In a number of speeches
                    Marshall would turn to some of the elderly men who wore the button of the Grand Army of the
                    Republic, pause, and say: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>If you boys who wore the blue had not offered yourselves as a sacrifice there would have been
                            an aristocracy in this country that would have ultimately destroyed the republic.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>

            <p>Thomas Marshall's speeches in the Indiana campaign of 1908 were marked by effective audience
                    adaptation, arguments from facts and assertions, and a clear and informal style. Underlying the
                    structure and style of every speech was the element of sincerity. The conversational mode of
                    delivery, constancy in support of the Democratic platform, consistency in statements of freedom from
                    special interests all added force to this impression. Marshall said he was and would be
                    unimpeachable, and the voters believed him. The immediate audience reaction to the speeches was
                    cheering and applauding; the election results proved that their approval was not temporary.</p>
            <p>On the eve of the election the political speculators believed that William Howard Taft would defeat
                    Bryan for the presidential electors of Indiana, but the odds were even on the gubernatorial race.62
                    If the pattern of previous years was followed, the Republicans would win. Not since 1872 when Thomas
                    A. Hendricks, a Democrat, was elected governor had Indiana given its vote for the presidency to the
                    candidate <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Also, the Republicans seemed to be riding the crest of a tide of successes in recent Indiana
                    elections. The last Democratic victory had been in 1892. In 1896 the Republican margin in the
                    presidential election was 18,000; in 1900 it was 26,000. The Republican governors won by
                    "only slightly less decisive" margins. The difference in 1904 was the largest
                    since the Civil War, with Roosevelt obtaining a majority of 94,000 and Hanly elected governor by
                    84,000. The Republicans maintained their average lead of 30,000 in the off-year vote two years
                        later.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> A significant shift would have to occur if Marshall and the
                    Democrats were to win.</p>
            <p>The balloting took place on November 3 with both parties, as usual, stating their confidence as to
                    the outcome. The vote was close, and it was several days before some of the winners of state offices
                    were known. This was not true of Taft or Marshall. Although the exact pluralities were unavailable
                    for nearly three days, the Democrats conceded the state to Taft and the Republicans admitted that
                    Marshall had defeated Watson.<hi rend="sup">64</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The total vote was more than 712,000 and the Democrats had won a partial victory. Eleven of the
                    thirteen congressmen elected were Democrats, but of the eleven positions on the state ticket only
                    three were gained by Democrats: the superintendent of public instruction by 762 votes, the
                    lieutenant governor by 1,672, and the governor by 14,809.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> Even though
                    Marshall's margin of victory was only 2 per cent of the total vote, that was superior to
                    the margin of any other candidate in either party. He had been a dark horse for his party's
                    nomination and had entered the campaign unknown to the constituency. Now he had won the most
                    decisive victory of any of the candidates.</p>
            <p>Newspaper analysts of the day offered numerous post hoc reasons for Marshall's victory.
                    Among them were "personal popularity" and "personal triumph."
                    These seemed to be the only justifications for a vote that ignored party lines on the state and

                            personal charms, his strong character, and clean life together with his admitted great

            <p>The evidence is more than circumstantial that many of the thousands of voters Marshall attracted to
                    himself were convinced by his speaking. Some Democratic candidates had been elected on the
                    progressive wave that had begun to sweep the Middle West, but Marshall had preached old-fashioned
                    Jeffersonian doctrine and "inveighed against most of the new fangled notions in
                    politics… . The people heard him so gladly that they elected him Governor in a State that

                    believed that Marshall "contributed greatly to his success in the campaign by his
                    speeches." Among other things he "talked plainly" and "created

                    weeks of speechmaking his statements on all issues were both consistent and clear; he objected to
                    the deception and subterfuge practiced by some politicians. Not only is this candidness apparent
                    from the speeches themselves, but it is in accordance with Marshall's philosophy as
                    expressed in his Recollections: "The things which many people conceive to be necessary and

                    presentation and consistent interpretation of the campaign issues.</p>

                    Indiana, September 10, 1870, his early life was closely associated with the school system of the
                    state. He attended country school near his home and was later graduated from the high school of
                    Delphi. He served as teacher and principal of various schools of his neighborhood until he went to

            <p>After two years of study at Indiana University Professor Lynch received the A.B. degree in 1903.
                    While a student at Indiana he became a charter member and the first president of the History Club.

                    holding an Austin fellowship. He returned to Indiana State where he was advanced to the
                    professorship in 1917. When Ball State Teachers College was founded at <placeName>

            <p>Throughout his life Professor Lynch revealed the quiet and unpretentious spirit of a man who wanted

                    to him to help young people realize their potentialities. Always he was concerned with finding
                    positions and advancements for his friends, friends who were to be found throughout the nation and
                    in the many organizations of which he was a member. He believed in the value of study and teaching

                        <p>I suppose you may think it quite strange to write you a letter so soon. We do not
                                    know how soon we may leave here and as I had my picture taken today I thought it
                                    best to get it on the way as soon as possible. I suppose you will all know me I
                                    think it is a very good picture. I had it taken to my own taste I hope you will
                                    finde know fault with it. We were orderd out last night to strengthen the Picket
                                    line. I suppose Our General's expecti[n]g an attacked. We were out untile
                                    eight Oclock this morning then retur[n]ed to our quarter's. Our
                                    teame's are buisy forageing every day two Regiment's and two
                                    peice's of Artillery always are sent along to guard the teams. Sometimes
                                    thair orcurred's quite a little skirmish while out. The other day when part
                                    of the fourth Brigade were out with the forage train thay were surrounded by one
                                    Brigade of Reb's they having several peice's of artillery with
                                    them. They had got in between our froage train and our picket line so our men could
                                    not send in for reinforcement so thair only chance was to cut thair way through The
                                    reporte is that we lost 15 wagons 2 men killed and two men wounded in the 93 <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName>. By all appearance's it seem's to me as if we will
                                    have a heavy fight on hand before long. I may be mistaken. If we have to fight them
                                    here I hope we will give them the best th[r]ashing they every had. And the sooner
                                    the better. It seem's the same to me as when we were lying in camp before
                                    Corint do not know what hour or minute we may be called to fight or march. I hope
                                    this will soon be settled and we all can retur[n] home again. I think I writen about
                                    all. May this find you all in the best of health. I still keep good health and am
                                    very thankfull for it. give my best love to all.</p>

                                    dispute. By having it on the way we ware them the S come's before the U. So

                        <salute>Dear Brother George</salute>
                        <p>Your long looked for letter I received today. I thought something was wrong that you
                                    did not write sooner I am sorry to hear that William is sick I hope it may not prove
                                    to be the small pox. It is my earnest wish that he may be a getting better fast ere
                                    this is received. You say you saw them prisinor's that were taken at
                                    Vixburg it was quite a squad. I think if Gen Grant succeed's in taken
                                    Vichburg and the Army in thare it will not be long in putting down this rebellion.
                                    For that is one of thair main strong hold's. And will give our
                                    armie's down thare a chance to co-operate with us. May we be more
                                    successfull every day. I expect you have received that letter I wrote you of the
                                    31st so it will be of no use to write the same again. I expect we will make a
                                    forward move, it looks so at the present. It is always our luck to build breastworks
                                    and fortification's for others it is said that Van Cleave[General Horatio
                                    VanCleve]'s division occupys this place and we move on as usual. Our
                                    brigade has been to work every day except Sunday and sometime's Sunday, and
                                    night as well as day time every scince the fight here. Now as the most of the work
                                    and roughest of the work is done we are releived. They always ride a free horse to
                                    death. This is our case in most instances***. thare is one thing certan it will not

                                    past week which make's the weather very comfortable. We have
                                    Order's to be ready at a moment's notice with seven days

                                    Rosecrance keeps wakeing them up occasionly and make's them beleive he is
                                    comeing by snatching off thair pickets now and then. Our mounted Infantry and
                                    cavelry are working nobely ever scince we have been here. I suppose if Old [General

                    </placeName> in April of 1863, warned the Copperheads in his home community of the folly and
                    traitorous nature of their views and activities. The Copperhead movement was then gaining momentum
                    but Wells predicted ultimate success for the glorious Union and, though apparently uncertain about
                    the ultimate impact of emancipation, he considered talk of Negro immigration to and Negro equality
                    in Indiana as disruptive propaganda. Sergeant Wells' letter illustrates the understandingly
                    bitter feelings of loyal soldiers at the front toward the Copperheads, but it is not of much help
                    regarding their actual strength and role in Indiana during the war.</p>

                        <p>Permit me to appeal to you, who has spent twelve years of his life with you I have
                                    enjoyed the society of many of you and have as much interest for you as any man can
                                    have. But I am sorry to hear by letters sent to the soldiers and by newspapers that
                                    are read in camp that there is some in Jefferson township who are endeavoring to
                                    form secret lodges called the Knights of the Golden Circle for the purpose of
                                    protecting deserters that they have persuaded to leave the federal army. To all such
                                    let me ask them a question, what do you expect to gain by your wild and mad career.
                                    I would advise you to look back to the beginning of this wicked rebellion. You were
                                    made believe by the southern leaders and a few demagogues of the north that the <placeName>

                                    equality in the north. For these reasons you were made to believe that the south had
                                    a just right to secede and form a Southern Confederacy. You were told that they had
                                    a right under the Constitution of the <placeName>

                                    </placeName> to secede peaceably if they wish to do so and that, that should be no
                                    reason for bringing on a war with the <pb n="177" id="VAA4025-053-2-055"/>

                                    </placeName>. And you were made to believe that one southern man could whip five
                                    northern yankies as traitors called us. And some of you said that <placeName>

                                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                                    </placeName> and the Southern Confederacy would soon be a great nation and Jeff
                                    Davis a great man while the north would become verry poor and Abe. Lincoln verry
                                    unpopular, and consequently the <placeName>
                                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                                    states. And since the rebellion began you have been sympathiseing with the rebels in
                                    the south and trying to cripple the efforts of the armies that were trying to put
                                    down rebellion. You have threatened to destroy the property of union soldiers while
                                    they were in the army fighting to protect you and your property as well as their
                                    own. Now this war has been carried on nearly two years, and I ask you has the
                                    southern leaders fullfilled one promise they made to their soldiers. I answer they
                                    have not and the Confederate army is growing weaker every day while the Federal army
                                    is growing stronger and the soldiers in the Federal army are more revived in the
                                    work of their country than they ever were before. They have resolved to stand by the
                                    Union and fight for the Star Spangled bannor till again it shall wave over every
                                    state that belonged to the Union and over the heads of every traitor both south and
                                    north. The traitors at home may say what they please about the Presidents
                                    Proclimation. if we dont like it we will say but little about it but we will never
                                    forsake the Union as long as the Presidents Proclimation is in favor of weakening
                                    the rebellion.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> We are in for saveing our once glorious Union if
                                    it costs the lives and blood of every rebel in the south and if that wont do we will
                                    about face and hang and kill every butternut and copperhead in the north. I had
                                    rather kill a rebel at home any time than kill a man that will fight face to face.
                                    The copperheads must not talk about burning and stealing the property of the
                                    soldiers that are in the union army for there is a day when they will repent of it.
                                    this war will not last allways and we are shure <list type="footnotes">

                                    them into Indiana by the 1st of April. I want some of you smart educated Knights of

                                    that are so fraid of the south being wronged out of their rights why dont you come
                                    down south and join the rebels and help them fight for their rights. They have
                                    acknowledged that one man of theirs cant whip five of ours and they say their

                                    have been doing, when you can accomplish nothing only your own destruction and the

                                    </placeName> Government will free the negroes and turn them loose among you. But let
                                    us examine that point. For my part I have no uneasiness about that if the rebels
                                    would lay down their arms and come back into the Union. The majority of the union
                                    soldiers are in favor of restoreing the Union and the Constitution if it frees every
                                    slave in the south, then they will vote for men that are in favor of sending the
                                    negroe where he belongs or as near there as he can be got. You know as well as I do
                                    that the rebels have had a chance to save their slaves and property too by coming
                                    back to the Union in due time but they did not so who is to blame but themselves.
                                    They was not willing to any compromise nor nothing else only their independence that
                                    they will never get. It is now plain that they will have to return to the Union and
                                    the sooner the better for them. The rebellion would soon end if it was not for the
                                    leaders. They know that they are whiped and are only holding the southern troops
                                    between them and us to save their own necks till they have an opportunity to get a
                                    way. The rebels are sick enough in this section of the country. Instead of starving
                                    the Federals they have starved themselves. Now as I am about to conclude and dont
                                    know wheather I will ever see any of you or not I desire that you honor your

            <p>As the center for genealogical research in Indiana, the Genealogy Division of the State Library is
                    continually building up its valuable collection of county records. Beginning with the present issue
                    of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> we shall list for each county in the state the official records
                    and indexes that have been obtained over a period of years. Some of these are on microfilm, a few
                    are photostats, some are extracts of records made by individuals and organizations in the counties,
                    and some are indexes of county records made under the auspices of the Works Progress Administration.
                    The list includes only the material housed in the Genealogy Division and only the records kept by
                    county officials. Other county material is available such as census records, county histories,
                    cemetery, family, and Bible records. For a complete listing of all material available on any
                    particular county, one should consult the card index in the Genealogy Division.</p>
            <p>The first microfilming of county records was done in 1936 by the Historical Records Survey of the
                    Works Progress Administration. The project at that time was limited largely to the older counties in
                    the southern part of the state. The microfilms were placed in the Archives Division of the State
                    Library and at a later date positive copies were made for the Genealogy Division of those records
                    especially pertinent to genealogical study. In the 1950's a new microfilming project was
                    begun by the Genealogy Division with funds received from the Eugene Haslet Darrach Memorial Library
                    of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Library. Up to the present time (1957) deed indexes, wills, early marriages, and
                    probate records have been filmed in almost all the counties in the southern part of the state, and
                    the project is being continued in the central and northern counties as funds become available.</p>

            <p>The local chapters of the Daughters of the American Revolution have taken the lead in making
                    available extracts of wills, probate, and marriage records from many counties. The Genealogy
                    Division is indebted to them for placing copies of these extracts in its Library where they may be
                    used by all patrons.</p>
            <p>Another type of record valuable for genealogical research is the indexes to the birth, death, and
                    marriage records. These were made under a WPA project sponsored by the State Department of Public
                    Welfare and cover principally the records kept by the county health officers. The work was not
                    carried on in every county.</p>
            <p>The systematic recording of births and deaths was not begun in Indiana until 1882, and in many
                    counties the records are not complete until a much later date. The indexes to the birth records show
                    the name of the father and mother, sex of the child, and date of birth. Unfortunately, the Christian
                    name given the child is sometimes not recorded, the attending physician apparently turning in the
                    record without waiting to learn the name. The indexes to the death records cover in general the
                    period from 1882 to 1920 and show the date and place of death and the age at death. These WPA
                    indexes cover the county birth and death records, but usually not those of the cities when they were
                    kept separate.</p>
            <p>Marriage transcripts sent by the county clerk to the county health officer beginning in 1882 are
                    indexed by the name of bride and groom. These give the name of father and maiden name of the mother
                    of the bride or groom as well as age and date of marriage. The project usually included the making
                    of a general index for the volumes of Marriage Records in the county clerk's office. These
                    indexes cover largely the period from 1850 to 1920 but in some instances they begin with the first
                    marriage records in the county. Names of the bride and groom are listed in alphabetical order with
                    name of spouse, date of birth, date of marriage, and reference to the number and page of the volume
                    in which the complete record may be found. In a few counties the Marriage Applications were indexed.
                    These are similar to the Transcripts in that they give the name of the father and mother of the
                    bride and groom.</p>
            <p>In listing the counties and their records, the date when the formation of each county became
                    effective is given as well <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-053-2-061"/> as the area out of which it was
                    formed. If the organization of county government was later than the formation of the county, this is
                    also given. The New Purchase embraced the land obtained from the Indians in 1818.</p>

                    served as a diary of this reconstructed rebel's struggle to reconciliate first the North
                    and the South, and then the Democratic party—should be of particular interest to
                    Hoosiers.</p>
            <p>As Irvin S. Cobb reminded us a generation ago in a "guyed book" to Indiana,
                    "There is a good deal of the Southerner in the composition of the typical
                    Hoosier." To this day, some profess that a more realistic Mason-Dixon Line (than its
                    projection down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>) slices Indiana along an approximation of U.S. Route 40. Certainly, during the Civil
                    War, in the Copperhead Country of Indiana below the National Road, countless Hoosiers would have
                    understood why young Watterson's loyalty to the South outweighed his love for the Union and
                    his hatred of slavery.</p>
            <p>Soon after stillness settled on the battlefields, the editor of the newspaper most widely read among
                    Confederate troops (<hi rend="i">The Rebel</hi>) came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. And thus, long before the present rulers of the <hi rend="i">Courier-Journal</hi>
                    coined the word "Ken-tuckiana" by which to lay claim to a vast circulation empire
                    across the river, Indiana found itself bounded on the south by one Henry Watterson.</p>
            <p>From the border of the great cataclysm, the young editor (only 28) began preaching reconciliation
                    through his <pb n="198" id="VAA4025-053-2-076"/> rhythmic writing. As in the case of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> citizen who at an earlier time had written in his diary that he believed only in the
                    Bible and Horace Greeley's weekly <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>—and if the two
                    should disagree, he would stick with Greeley—a cult of avid believers in Watterson soon
                    sprang up.</p>
            <p>Of course, lest this reviewer be misunderstood, Watterson did not direct his words and thoughts only
                    to Indianians. (Indiana merits mention only a few times in this book.) But by Watterson's
                    very proximity to Indiana, his pen undoubtedly prevailed upon many Hoosiers who not long before had
                    been on the brink of succumbing to the temptations of the plotted Northwest Confederacy.</p>
            <p>Through his pre-Reconstruction writing, Watterson tried to bring to those who had hated Lincoln a
                    true appreciation of the greatness and benevolence of the martyr who had lived his formative years
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and in Indiana, and an understanding of the miseries wrought upon the South by his
                    murder. He pounded away bluntly at the government in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to release the South from military rule until, in 1877, after the Tilden-Hayes
                    decision, the troops were recalled.</p>
            <p>Dr. Wall's chapters "To Victory with Tilden" and "On to
                    Defeat" are among the very best in the book and detail the role played by Watterson and his
                    paper in making the governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> acceptable to Democrats in both North and South, as well as his efforts to prevent the
                    "Crime of '76." The <hi rend="i">Courier-Journal</hi> was the first to
                    fly proudly from the top of its mast the pennant of the "hero" Watterson
                    discovered. The selection of Watterson as chairman of the nominating convention assured
                    Tilden's nomination, and "the press of the country, both Republican and
                    Democratic, hailed the selection of Watterson as a fitting tribute to a man who … `has
                    worked harder for peace and order at the South, and for honest money, as against the Greenback
                    delusion, than any other journalist in his party.'"</p>
            <p>As a consolation prize for the Middle West, writes Dr. Wall, Governor Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana
                    was given second place on the ticket. By the well-known 8–7 decision of the special
                    commission, Tilden and Hendricks lost—but in defeat Watterson had triumphed. As Dr. Wall
                    states: "With the expiration of the Forty-fourth Congress … Watterson could
                    return home from his only venture into officeholding <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-053-2-077"/> knowing
                    that officially the reconciliation of the sections had been achieved."</p>
            <p>Four more decades of a volatile career still lay ahead for Watterson, one of the last
                    "personal journalists." His pungent phrases darted through his editorials until
                    they became a part of the American language. He spoke with one of the most influential voices of his
                    party, yet quarrelled with all its great leaders—<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Grover Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, William Jennings Bryan, Woodrow Wilson. Nearing the climax of his fiery career, but
                    still spry in mind and sharp of tongue, he consigned the kaiser of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> and the emperor of <placeName>

                    </placeName>-<placeName>
                        <country reg="hu">Hungary</country>
                    </placeName> to the nether regions with the best-remembered, and possibly most characteristic,
                    Watterson words: "To Hell with the Hohenzollerns and Hapsburgs."</p>
            <p>The new biographer of Watterson chose to study "Marse Henry" at the suggestion of
                    Arthur Krock (formerly of the <hi rend="i">Courier-Journal</hi>), and worked with Allan Nevins of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> in writing his re-evaluation of the great editor for his 1951 doctoral dissertation.
                    The finished product is a tribute to both the subject and the writer.</p>
            <p>The late Alben W. Barkley, who wrote the introduction, found in Watterson and this book "a
                    charming chapter in the story of American democracy."</p>
            <p>We who have toiled on the latter-day <hi rend="i">Courier-Journal</hi> could not escape feeling that
                    Henry Watterson "is always a shadow behind your chair." Reading of the
                    "Reconstructed Rebel" gives substance to that shadow. No doubt about it,
                    "Henry Watterson was the last of his tribe."</p>

            <p>The volumes of this monumental work on the campaigns of the Federal armies during the Civil War
                    continue to appear with remarkable regularity. The first two came out in 1949, another three years
                    later, and now the fourth. Three more are projected. The story will then have been completed in
                    seven volumes, and Lincoln will not only have found his general (in fact Lincoln found him in the
                    third volume <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-053-2-078"/> whether he knew it or not) but in the seventh
                    volume the President will have found him bringing the war to a successful end. The first two volumes
                    carried the war in the East through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In the third volume the war in the West emerged, as did Grant, and continued through
                    the battles of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Corinth.</p>
            <p>Though the title of this work might seem to indicate that the spotlight should be kept on Grant, this
                    is, of course, not the case, and rightly so even after Lincoln had found his general; for this is a
                    history of all Federal military activities, including something of what happened west of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> River. In this volume Grant does not appear in full bloom until the victorious
                    Vicksburg campaign. The subtitle of this volume is luka to Vicksburg, but the whole military
                    situation in the West in the summer of 1862 is first made clear and then come in succeeding chapters
                    the battles of luka and of Corinth again; Buell's race with Bragg northward through <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, culminating in the Battle of Perry-ville; Rosecrans superseding Buell and fighting the
                    Battle of Stone's River; then Holly Springs and raiding activities in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>, <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>; and finally the capture of Vicksburg.</p>
            <p>Throughout it all there are many episodes, much drama, evaluations of men and events, and some
                    disagreements with previous evaluations. Although Professor Williams is no defender of Bragg in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> campaign and says that he was in a state of collapse before the end, he places a good
                    deal of the blame for the Confederate failure on Kirby Smith, in addition to the fact that
                    Buell's army also had something to do with that failure. Of course, Williams' hero
                    is General Grant, in whom he can see no guile—or at least not much. He is disturbed by
                    the newspaper reporter Sylvanus Cad-wallader's account of Grant having had a terrible brush
                    with King Alcohol before Vicksburg. In an appendix to this volume Williams goes to great length to
                    disprove Cad-wallader's charges and to mildly dress down the late Benjamin Thomas for being
                    so uncritical as to publish Cad-wallader's manuscript. Those interested in this little
                    literary tussle might read Thomas' reply in American Heritage, August, 1956.</p>
            <p>Williams pulls together with skill the many facets that make up the military operations in the West
                    during the year <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-053-2-079"/> of this volume—July, 1862, to July,
                    1863. He does not hesitate to forego the temptation to see one campaign through before he picks up
                    another which has been going on; he breaks off even at the most dramatic moment which might seem to
                    call for full speed ahead. Only a person with the feel of military life could read the many
                    documents of the Civil War and understand their full meaning and implications. Williams with his
                    military background has this ability—even to marching in his imagination with Grant and
                    Sherman. Apparently there were no first-hand close-up accounts of the surrender of Pemberton to
                    Grant at Vicksburg which would have made it possible to deal in the kind of dramatics which
                    characterized the surrender of Lee to Grant at Appo-mattox. Readers will have to wait until the
                    seventh volume to see what Williams does with the Grant-Lee affair.</p>
            <p>The author is good at using the proper adjective to show the shade of meaning he wants to leave with
                    the reader regarding personalities—"the gloating words of Van
                    Dorn's," Sherman's "incurable honesty." Also he can say
                    much, and that aptly, in a sentence of few words: "Well did Wheeler's boldness and
                    skill pay off in the face of an army which had been so indoctrinated with caution that even
                    curiosity was rare" (p. 133). As for that marplot who had tried to worm his way into and
                    seize the glory that was to come to the captor of Vicksburg: "If the <geogName>Yazoo
                    River</geogName> was one of nature's curiosities, so was John McClernand" (p.
                    308).</p>
            <p>These volumes are not fast reading; they are packed with too much information for that; but they are
                    easy reading and the time spent cannot help but be rewarding. And the two dozen well-executed maps
                    are a joy.</p>

                    unusual sight on the courthouse square, and slave jails were almost as commonplace as harness shops.</p>
            <p>It was in this community with its leisurely, provincial way of life that Mary Todd was born. Her
                    people were slaveholders and were important folks in Bluegrass society. Her situation was in sharp
                    contrast to the background of Abraham Lincoln who was born among the sterile ridges of the Knob
                    country. It would have been hard to have imagined in the earlier years, even of republican <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the region had its serious problems. The importation of slaves for sale, the attitude
                    of certain ministers and churches, and the changing conditions of agriculture threatened a slave
                    system so amply protected by constitutional guarantees. In time there were to be discordant voices

                    </placeName> as much as Jackson represented the era of the Common Man. He became the agrarian leader
                    behind the Jacksonian program—the representative of the yeoman farmer interests of the
                    rising West. It was he who spearheaded the attack on the "Monster" Bank of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> should have succeeded Jackson; instead, the Senator backed Van Buren and fought a
                    losing Congressional battle with the Whigs following the Panic of 1837. In 1841, Clay
                    "stole <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName>'s thunder" by getting the Distribution-Pre-emption Act through
                    Congress. But the triumph was really <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName>'s, for the distribution part of the Act became inoperative after 1842 and
                    pre-emption—a <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-053-2-082"/> measure long championed by
                    Benton—became a permanent part of the American land system.</p>
            <p>With the rise of the slavery issue in Tyler's administration, Benton ably grappled with
                    Calhoun. Failing in his role as peacemaker in the Polk administration, he split openly with the
                    southern leaders of his party. "Old Bullion" insisted, however, that it was
                    primarily the "professional political brokers" who dominated the conventions and
                    the party.</p>
            <p>Benton was associated early with nearly every measure favoring western development, but his ultimate
                    break with the slavery interests caused his defeat for re-election in 1850. He made the same
                    sacrificial stand for the Union as did <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Houston</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Stephen A. Douglas. For seven years he fought hard to make a comeback, but there
                    was only the solace of a short term in the lower house. The passage of the Graduation Act in 1854
                    was again his triumph, but he was not in Congress to claim that victory. He became a bitter critic
                    of the Pierce and Buchanan administrations, and in his declining years appeared to be more of a
                    Eepublican than a Democrat.</p>

                    </placeName> proved to be as courageous a fighter in retirement as he had been in the Senate.
                    Failing in politics, he turned to the profession of an author, and at once established an enviable
                    reputation. Though his house burned down and his materials and manuscript were lost, he undauntedly
                    forged ahead to complete his two-volume work, <hi rend="i">Thirty Years' View,</hi> a
                    lengthy record of his years in the Senate. But perhaps of even greater significance was his <hi rend="i">Abridgement of the Debates of Congress,</hi> from 1789 to 1850, published in fifteen
                    volumes. It was a work which George Bancroft predicted would be "the monument of the
                    age." <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> finished the last volume of this work on the day before his death.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the main reason for his not becoming President was that he never turned a stone in his own
                    behalf. Like Clay, Webster, and Calhoun, he was in the thick of politics and his record was not
                    always consistent. Furthermore, he was too often regarded as a "hothead." Fights
                    and several duels dotted his life, and like Jackson he had killed a man. Even his duel with Jackson
                    in his early life was not forgotten until Adams' administration. Notwithstanding these
                    traits, perhaps his greatest defect was his "pomposity," his
                    "vanity," his inflexible will; he seemed to love to play the role of a Roman
                    Senator.</p>
            <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-053-2-083"/>
            <p>In spite of these weaknesses, he was a great statesman. Perhaps we should speak of this age as having
                    been led by a quadrumvirate rather than a triumvirate, for his "contemporaries saw him as
                    the equal, even the superior, of his great senatorial adversaries, Clay, Calhoun, and
                    Webster." Greeley spoke of his "incorruptible career." Others spoke on
                    his "gigantic intellect," his "vast erudition," his
                    "capacious memory," and his "superb eloquence." Indeed, he had
                    come a long way for a self-educated man.</p>

            <p>This discerning biography is an account of Henry Churchill King in a career entirely associated with
                    Oberlin College. His life became interwoven with the history of the College and inevitably the
                    author has described the Oberlin community while setting forth King's character and place
                    in the ranks of American college presidents. Obviously the book will have special meaning for alumni
                    and friends of Oberlin. However, it should be of interest to other readers also, for it deals with
                    the thorny problems involved in preserving the character of an institution while modifying it to
                    meet the changes in American society which became particularly evident after 1914. Thus Oberlin
                    College in King's administration is a case study of the liberal arts college in transition.</p>
            <p>The biographer has a firm command of the material, often employing documents which would be useless
                    in less skillful hands. For example, he quotes King's pocket memorandum book entry for
                    November 19, 1902: "Trustee meeting 9 o'clock. Elected President in afternoon.
                    Rice Memorial Concert. Reception at Baldwin in evening. Student escort home" (p. 103). From
                    this and other equally unpromising evidence <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-053-2-084"/> Mr. Love succeeds
                    in drawing a clear portrait of a man who made his way without dramatic collisions, adventures, or
                    excitements while providing steady leadership for the College between 1902 and 1927 when he retired.</p>
            <p>King's early career seems to have been a long preparation for the presidency. In student
                    days and as a young instructor he absorbed the spirit of Oberlin, a college which still remembered
                    that it once had been a storm center for abolition and many other causes. Years of advanced study at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> and at the University of Berlin meant opportunities for research in philosophy and
                    theology. As representative of the College at conferences and meetings he learned much about the
                    workings of other academic institutions. Wide-flung connections and a growing reputation brought
                    occasional offers of presidencies elsewhere which he steadily declined. In 1902, however, he took up
                    the presidency of Oberlin with quiet self-confidence, indicating an intention to chart his own
                    course.</p>
            <p>King's administration was guided by a few basic ideas which he held with unswerving
                    tenacity; fundamental among these was the importance of the individual, his growth and development.
                    At his inaugural King spoke on "The Primacy of the Person in College Education."
                    And, although he saw the Oberlin endowment increase by millions and the construction of new building
                    after new building, he never ceased to show concern for the quality of the educational process
                    within those buildings. He always believed that the most valuable thing in a college course was
                    "personal contact with a great teacher" and that the first duty of a faculty
                    member was to fulfill his obligation to his students.</p>
            <p>In choosing his faculty President King did not hesitate to appoint graduates of Oberlin who had
                    adequate postgraduate training and experience obtained elsewhere. Among faculty members he exerted
                    leadership as a teaching president working with colleagues many of whom were his close friends.</p>
            <p>Readers who never glimpsed life in the American Middle West prior to 1914 may consider this book
                    unreal, an idealized portrait of a man and of a college written by a loyal alumnus, a
                    "court historian." But the fair-minded reader with some knowledge of the region
                    and the period in which King did his work will recognize this biography as an extra-ordinarily <pb n="207" id="VAA4025-053-2-085"/> graphic and discriminating appraisal. Relations with the
                    townspeople of Oberlin, financial promotion, public service involving representation of the College
                    to the outside world, King's writing, and his service in World War I—all come
                    under review. Of particular interest in the light of recent Suez Canal troubles is the section of
                    the book dealing with the King-Crane Report. At the conclusion of World War I Wilson hoped to create
                    an Inter-Allied Commission to Syria which would study the situation there and recommend to the Peace
                    Conference what should be done with the lands and peoples of the former Ottoman Empire. President
                    King and Charles R. Crane were appointed as the American Commissioners. Their report, written after
                    travel in the Near East, touched on Zionism and other matters now very much to the fore. The Arabs
                    welcomed the Commission; the Zionists seemed to fear that its report would impair the fulfillment of
                    the Balfour Declaration creating a national home for the Jews.</p>
            <p>Something of King's statesmanship is revealed in his basic theory of educational
                    administration: "that it is necessary to carry with you the convictions—not
                    merely the opinions—of the faculty and the student body. If in initiating some measure of
                    your own, you cannot command that support, it means that the measure is, at least for the time
                    being, unripe."</p>
            <p>President King did not consider financial promotion to be "the main job." He
                    seriously hoped that the College would receive support simply by doing such excellent work that
                    people would desire to contribute. Naive as it may seem, King announced at the beginning of his
                    administration that he did not intend to become a beggar for the College. His approach proved
                    attractive to one substantial donor, at least; without solicitation Herbert A. Wilder gave
                    $375,000 to Oberlin. For all of his diffidence about financial promotion King was
                    remarkable in securing money for the College and by the end of his administration the school had an
                    endowment of more than eighteen million dollars.</p>
            <p>President King's colleagues were essential for his effectiveness as teacher and president.
                    He had around him such men as Edward I. Bosworth, Kemper Fullerton, Charles H. A. Wager, and Charles
                    B. Martin who all exerted an influence on students comparable to that of King himself. <pb n="208" id="VAA4025-053-2-086"/> Again and again the author deftly catches in a few sentences the facets
                    of personalities associated with King. He also reveals uncommon insight and taste in his account of
                    the King household, attributing to Mrs. King a most important part in the career of her basically
                    shy and overly sensitive husband. Julia Coates King enabled the Kings to build and to maintain
                    friendships with students and faculty alike by providing apparently effortless and genuine
                    hospitality for literally thousands of guests. Her quiet good sense and firm grip on reality gave
                    balance and serenity to everyone around her.</p>
            <p>This is a beautifully written book about an attractive man and the college he served. Throughout the
                    volume one glimpses a unique combination of scholarship, friendliness, religious faith, and devotion
                    to social causes and to principle—elements of a character which appeared in King and in
                    many of the men who worked with him. Mr. Love's biography will win a place in the
                    literature of the liberal arts college; certainly it is the definitive biography of President King
                    of Oberlin.</p>

            <p>This is a long and detailed, but never dull, biography of Tecumseh, Shawnee chief, brother of the

                    prior to the War of 1812. As a biography it contains all that can conceivably be known about
                    Tecumseh from birth to death. It is, however, more than a biography; it is essentially a history of

                    qualities of leadership and personal magnetism. He strongly advocated that if the Indians were to
                    remain Indians, not succumb to the agricultural life of the whites or be dragged down into <pb n="209" id="VAA4025-053-2-087"/> drunken poverty by their whiskey, they must cease giving away
                    the tribal hunting lands by treaty and unite to resist the ever-moving frontier. From 1808 until the
                    outbreak of the War of 1812 he sought with only moderate success to sell this message to tribes both
                    north and south.</p>
            <p>Outside of the dime novel variety produced by the professional hacks and those written for juveniles,
                    there have been only a few biographies of Tecumseh of any merit: Benjamin Drake, <hi rend="i">The
                        Life of Tecumseh and His Brother the Prophet,</hi> 1841; Edward Eggleston, <hi rend="i">Tecumseh
                        and the Shawnee Prophet,</hi> 1878; E. 0. Randall, "Tecumseh, The Shawnee
                    Chief" in <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                        </placeName> Archeological and Historical Society Publications,</hi> XV, 1906; Norman S. Gurd,
                        <hi rend="i">The Story of Tecumseh,</hi> 1912; and John M. Oskinson, <hi rend="i">Tecumseh and
                        His Times,</hi> 1938. Perhaps this great Indian chief has not attracted more biographers because
                    source materials relating to him are scattered in widely separated depositories, are fragmentary and
                    in many instances contradictory. The Shawnee had no written language, and many of the records that
                    remain were written by whites, some of whom were strongly biased and singularly inaccurate in their
                    accounts. The author has used this extant evidence judiciously, even where the trail has grown dim,
                    and has given us a modern appraisal of Tecumseh in youth and manhood as he played his role in peace,
                    diplomacy, and war.</p>
            <p>Readers who are expecting traditional treatment of such topics as the Prophet, William Henry
                    Harrison, the Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, the causes of the War of 1812, the capture of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the death of Tecumseh will not find them in this biography. Mr. Tucker is not a
                    traditionalist and takes particular pains to revise the historical record when his reading of the
                    sources makes it necessary. Nor is he hesitant to call a spade by its correct title when, upon
                    careful examination and distillation of evidence, it has all the characteristics of a spade.</p>
            <p>Laulewasika, better known as the Prophet, youngest brother of Tecumseh was not, as has been commonly
                    recorded, a misguided epileptic who held a charm over the Indians but a great and even remarkable
                    religious leader whose doctrines possessed a brand of militant racialism used by Tecumseh to further
                    his own plans for Indian solidarity. Though the Prophet was vain, arrogant and sometimes vindictive
                        <pb n="210" id="VAA4025-053-2-088"/> and a great emotional force in the Indian world, Tecumseh
                    emerges the dominant leader, the final voice of authority exercising a restraining influence on his
                    weaker and less stable brother.</p>
            <p>The picture Tucker draws of Harrison is not complimentary. Harrison is described as a verbose
                    ("he never permitted one word to serve a purpose when two would do" p. 134), proud
                    man who never really understood Indian character and was arbitrary and wily to the point of
                    circumvention in his negotiations and dealings with the red men. The Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> was precipitated by Harrison: "He was the aggressor. The responsibility rested
                    with him" (p. 218). "He was not only the aggressor, he was the presumptuous treaty
                    breaker… . Harrison's march was an outright invasion of the territory of another
                    nation without the consent of the President or a declaration of war by Congress" (p. 219). <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> was a minor engagement of no consequence, except to make Harrison President.</p>
            <p>In what should be a final conclusion on one important aspect of war guilt Mr. Tucker has clearly
                    demonstrated that the Indian unrest preceding the outbreak of the War of 1812 was not the work of
                    the British in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> or the work of British agents circulating among the tribes promoting, urging, and
                    fomenting Indian attacks against the frontier. He has conclusively shown that the British were
                    strictly neutral and attempted to restrain Tecumseh and the Indians. The contemporary reports by
                    Harrison, western newspapers, and regional historians to the effect that the British in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> were the fountainhead of Indian aggression was unfounded propaganda so loudly and
                    repeatedly trumpeted that it seemingly had become inextricably woven into the fabric of American
                    historical writing. Now, thanks to this author we, at last, are set straight.</p>
            <p>This reviewer had always assumed that Major General Isaac Brock was the sole moving force behind the
                    capture of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> by a combined force of British and Indians in the War of 1812. Mr. Tucker quickly
                    dispels this opinion and points out that a great deal of Brock's success at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> was due to Tecumseh's military knowledge: "The British leader had
                    come to recognize that Tecumseh's knowledge of the country was invaluable, almost
                    photographic; but still not so important to the success of the campaign as his military judgment <pb n="211" id="VAA4025-053-2-089"/> and tactical ability, his quick eye for good battle positions
                    and his understanding of the value of intelligence and the need for its speedy transmission to
                    headquarters" (p. 267).</p>
            <p>Tecumseh presumably was killed in the Battle of the Thames, October 5, 1813. The legend was fostered
                    by returning soldiers and during the Presidential campaign of 1836 that Colonel Richard M. Johnson
                    shot him with his pistol. This version as well as others still seeps into regional literature.
                    Tucker has sifted all the evidence pertaining to Tecumseh in this battle and concludes: "No
                    one knows how he was killed, who killed him or where he lies buried, though as with other epic
                    heroes, the search and research have been indefatigable" (p. 319).</p>
            <p>It is occasionally the practice in writing a "favorable" review to pick out minor
                    flaws "which mar the work" in order to demonstrate the reviewer's
                    objectivity, or superiority. There are a few errors of fact in this volume but it would be
                    ungracious, even presumptuous, to note them. This is a good book, a readable one, written after long
                    and purposeful use of historical sources by an author filled with refreshing enthusiasm for his
                    subject.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Story of Cyrus Woodman</hi> represents a kaleidoscopic view of the life of a western
                    land agent, 1840–1870. The value of this partial biography comes from the careful
                    enumeration and description which it contains of the activity of a man engaged in such a profession.
                    Cyrus Woodman, land agent, and others like him were the invaluable middlemen in the settling of the
                    West.</p>
            <p>Woodman's experiences also give good indication of the wide range of western business
                    opportunities open to the enterprising man. Numerous schemes to gain wealth presented themselves,
                    asking only for the investment of money, time, and energy. The vigorous and growing western society
                    was a challenge, a place in which fortunes could be made—and <pb n="212" id="VAA4025-053-2-090"/> lost. That Woodman made and held his fortune is a tribute to his
                    ability.</p>
            <p>Woodman was raised in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName> and remained attached to the East throughout his life. Always he longed for its
                    cultured and civilized tone; the West was the materialistic, profit-making, working-world in which
                    he could best earn a living. Thus, after a brief business career in a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> law office, he secured employment with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Western Land Company and went west to make his fortune.</p>
            <p>His talents for meticulous work and painstaking exactness placed him in good stead as a land agent,
                    as he conscientiously tried to sell his company's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> lands. Although settlers poured into the region, few of them had cash and
                    Woodman's job was a constant struggle to secure income for his company.</p>
            <p>From <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Woodman moved to the promising <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> Territory and established his headquarters at Mineral Point. Disassociating himself
                    from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Western Land Company, he entered a partnership with the energetic Cadwallader
                    Washburn. Then followed his years of greatest business success: the talents of the two partners
                    complemented each other as they sold land, practiced law, and engaged in timberland speculation,
                    shot manufacture, and many other enterprises. Always their fortunes rose, and both men gained
                    financial independence.</p>
            <p>Following the dissolution of this partnership in 1855, Woodman strove to devote less time to business
                    and more time to his family and to cultural activities. More and more Woodman thought and talked of
                    a retirement in the East. Financial difficulties, however, held him to the West, as he continued to
                    supervise his investments, to make new investments, and to develop land sales for the St.
                    Mary's Falls Ship Canal Company in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>. During this work and his subsequent employment as a supervisor for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Burlington</settlement>
                    </placeName> railroad, his family remained in the East. Whenever possible Woodman remained with them
                    and finally in 1870 he was able to join them permanently.</p>
            <p>While Woodman gave support to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society and the Mineral Point Library Association, his philanthropic
                    interests largely centered in the cultural institutions of the East. The reader regrets that these
                    interests are not spelled out in more detail, just as he regrets that <pb n="213" id="VAA4025-053-2-091"/> Woodman's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> and European experiences are passed over so briefly. From this book does emerge,
                    however, a picture of Woodman as a Yankee business man: an easterner who found profitable employment
                    for his abilities in the West.</p>

            <p>The title and the author's preface give a truthful indication of the theme of the book.
                    There is no attempt at a detailed biography of a many-sided man. Some earlier biographers seemed to
                    feel it necessary to portray <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> as excelling as a scientist, geographer, religious missionary, political administrator,
                    business man and sailor. The research of later historians resulted in the downgrading of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> in some of these aspects of his personality. The critical process continued until some
                    writers ended up with the conclusion that he was a visionary, adventuresome charlatan who undertook
                    to find certain things, found some other things, but never knew what he did find. Some of these
                    definitely questioned his proficiency as a seaman. These were of the opinion that there were a
                    number of sailors in his crew who were more proficient than he and that he depended upon their
                    judgment and advice but did not admit it.</p>
            <p>Professor Morison has restricted himself to the task of writing the history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a mariner. One feels that Morison has come to the conclusion that this was what <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> essentially and really was. Other aspects of his life are mentioned and sometimes these
                    references give evidence of the shortcomings of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> in some of these respects. These references, however, are brought in only to the extent
                    that they have bearing on the major theme. After one has read the book he concludes that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> must have been the greatest mariner of his time and, considering changing conditions,
                    one of the greatest of all times. This conclusion is reached not because the author has labored or
                    argued the issue, but because he has in a clear, simple narrative followed <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> through his four voyages and related just what <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> did in described situations. The whole story seems <pb n="214" id="VAA4025-053-2-092"/>
                    so simple and casual that the reader may not realize that it could never have been written at all by
                    anyone who did not possess historical judgment and deep understanding of and feeling for the sea and
                    sailing ships. Incidentally the author has once again proved that a truthful narrative of a real
                    sea-adventure can be more thrilling than fiction.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
                    </placeName> study? Was his critical attitude toward World War II influenced by his previous
                    contacts and work with Japanese politicians and scholars in the field of municipal government?</p>
            <p>At any rate, Mrs. Beard indicates the unusual diversity of her husband's interests, she
                    emphasizes his independence of character, and she pictures him as having been a reformer at heart.
                    She also makes clear that his father had sufficient wealth to provide a library from which Beard
                    early became acquainted with some of the classics and also adequate to afford him excellent
                    educational opportunities without undue concern about obtaining his daily bread.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately the lengthy quotation from a county history concerning Beard's father is
                    inaccurately reproduced and in some cases paraphrased (pp. 9–12) and the statements
                    indicating that <placeName>

            <p>Mrs. Beard, however, has written an affectionate tribute to her husband which should be studied by
                    persons seeking to understand Charles A. Beard. It is hoped that she has been painstaking in
                    preserving the correspondence and other papers of this native Hoosier who served as president of
                    both the American Historical Association and the American Political Science Association, especially
                    since efforts to interpret and evaluate him continue at a remarkable pace.</p>

                    239–285) from two other of Schoolcraft's works, <hi rend="i">The Myth of

                    </placeName>, 1847). In an editor's introduction (pp. ix-xxii) Williams passes from
                    historical generalities on the American Indian to some rather interesting, but not altogether
                    accurate, biographical particulars about Schoolcraft and about the "much debated question
                    of Longfellow's indebtedness to Schoolcraft" (p. xix). Data bearing on this latter
                    point, which clearly intrigues Williams as it has other scholars, is also contained in Appendix B
                    (pp. 313–317) of Williams' present book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Schoolcraft's Indian Legends</hi> is an interesting effort to reproduce, in
                    convenient and accessible form, a pioneer collection of American Indian tales, annotated with
                    reasonable fullness. For the lay reader this may be enough. But for anyone <pb n="216" id="VAA4025-053-2-094"/> who has had occasion to use Schoolcraft for folkloristic or
                    ethnological research, it is not. Williams' criterion for inclusion of material in his book
                    was, so he tells us, "Is this a legend?" (p. v). If material was not what Williams
                    judged to be a "legend" (a form which he does not define) it was "rigidly
                    excluded"; all "biographical and historical Indian narratives" in
                    Schoolcraft's works were thus summarily omitted—or so Williams would have us
                    believe. However, his last selection from Schoolcraft (pp.282–285) is, in the
                    reviewer's opinion, both biographical and historical. Moreover, much of American Indian
                    biographical and historical material is, as Schoolcraft himself pointed out, tradition degenerated
                    into fable (p. 303); therefore it is hard to see where Williams could draw the line for the rigid
                    exclusion he says he practiced. It is also difficult for the folklorist, interested in the
                    distribution of motifs, to accept the fact that Williams has excluded from his book "a
                    large number of myths and legends which were mentioned in Schoolcraft's epitomes and
                    compendiums of Indian lore… either by summary, by reference, or by expository
                    fragments" (p. v). The exclusion of such material (which need not have been reproduced, but
                    should have been included by reference) makes it imperative that any folklorist with a serious
                    interest in Schoolcraft's tale material consult Schoolcraft's own works, rather
                    than Williams' present volume.</p>
            <p>A surprising omission from the Williams book is any reference to the recently published <hi rend="i">Index</hi> of Schoolcraft's six-volume <hi rend="i">Historical and Statistical
                        Information Respecting … the Indian Tribes of the <placeName>

                    a member of the editorial staff of the Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology, was
                    published in 1954 as Bulletin 152 of the Bureau of American Ethnology, under the title <hi rend="i">Index to Schoolcraft's "Indian Tribes of the <placeName>

                    Stirling, Director, Bureau of American Ethnology, in which Schoolcraft and his major works are
                    discussed. Williams reproduces Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's remark in his diary that
                    Schoolcraft's <hi rend="i">Historical and Statistical Information</hi> is not indexed (p.
                    314), but neither at this point, nor in his bibliography is any reference made to the Nichols Index.
                    Another unfortunate omission <pb n="217" id="VAA4025-053-2-095"/> from Williams'

            <p>Dr. Thomas is Provincial Archivist of Saskatchewan and has made full use of the materials there as
                    well as those of the federal and other provincial archives. The result is a political narrative of
                    Canadian territorial administration dating from the Dominion's acquisition of the
                    North-West Territories, in 1870, up to 1897 when responsible government was achieved.</p>
            <p>The government of the Honorable Hudson's Bay Company in the territories and the transfer of
                    governmental power to the Dominion is traced with the attitudes of the few newspapers in the new
                    territories considered. The feelings of the people of the territories, many of whom were Metis,
                    French-Indian mixtures, are discussed. The author notes the force of church leaders among these
                    people and the lack of understanding by many in the Dominion government of their role. The revolt of
                    the Metis, in 1870, led by Louis Riel is barely noticed, since Dr. Thomas discounts this effort
                    along with the Riel revolt of 1885 as not being a part of the main effort toward autonomous
                    government for the territories.</p>
            <p>Of the territory acquired by the Dominion in 1870, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mbc">Manitoba</region>
                    </placeName> was granted provincial status from the start. Although the Riel revolt of 1870 is
                    considered as a major reason for the granting of autonomy to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mbc">Manitoba</region>
                    </placeName>, the role of Riel is discounted.</p>
            <p>The gradual development of representative government in the territories is traced. The role of the
                    lieutenant-governor is developed and the growing importance of the <pb n="218" id="VAA4025-053-2-096"/> advisory council is traced from its ineffective beginning to
                    development into a legislature. The influence of the extension of the Canadian Pacific Railroad upon
                    the territories and the efforts of its promoters to keep the territories under federal
                    administration are mentioned but not developed extensively.</p>
            <p>The author notes the effects of the American territorial system upon the Canadian territories as it
                    was interpreted in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ottawa</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The experience gained by the Americans under their system, as set out in the Northwest
                    Ordinance in 1787, was ignored and only the system itself considered. After 1827, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> initiated territorial governments without the first stage (the step by which officials
                    were appointed by the federal government), and instituted governments only in the second stage which
                    provided for a territorial legislature. The North-West Territory started its political life in 1870
                    with an appointed government—long after the Americans had found that phase of development
                    unworkable.</p>
            <p>Dr. Thomas concludes that the Canadian government assumed the "Imperial mantle" of
                    Britain and used the mother country's policy of cautious, gradual extension of provincial
                    autonomy. American practices are evident in the Canadian system, but the Dominion government
                    generally adhered to British practices.</p>
            <p>This book has three small maps which amply illustrate the shift in boundaries and the electoral
                    districts set up during the territorial period. Several tables of population are included with
                    tabulations of electoral information pertinent to the discussion.</p>
            <p>That the narrative is a little hard for the reader to keep going, at times, does not detract from the
                    value of this study. Undoubtedly, some readers would like this book in a more expanded form to
                    include the Riel Revolts and fuller reasoning as to why Riel "did not represent the main
                    stream of the autonomy movement in the Canadian North-West."</p>
            <p>Historians interested in the study of Turner's frontier thesis might find considerable
                    material here for comparative purposes. The population movement in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> was also westward and met conditions similar to those encountered in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Dr. Thomas ably presents the political development of the Canadian frontier, but does
                    not go much beyond that consideration.</p>

                    </placeName>'s economy. The author begins with "<placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1815," devotes chapters to "Transportation and
                    Communication," "The Settlement of the Hinterland," "Currency
                    and Exchange," "Commerce and Industry," and concludes with a brief eulogy
                    of Yankee achievement under the title, "<placeName>

                    </placeName> at the Close of 1825." In competent fashion Mr. Dain defines the problems
                    confronting the community (dependable transportation, an adequate local food supply, and a stable
                    currency) and describes their solution.</p>
            <p>The period under consideration has special interest because it concerns <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s transition from a leisurely, French, fur-trading, garrison village to a
                    bustling, Yankee, commercial town. The inevitable cultural conflict involved, while not explicitly
                    treated, is frequently suggested in the author's generous use of contemporary strictures
                    upon the <hi rend="i">habitant.</hi> He was "shiftless" and "lacking in
                    ambition." "He wasted … his time in idleness and amusement."

                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>. And the migrant Yankee of the early nineteenth century was rarely tolerant of cultural
                    patterns that differed from his own. A fuller treatment of the processes whereby the <hi rend="i">habitant</hi> relinquished or lost his <placeName>

            <p>Many more studies of this kind are needed. Definitive syntheses in urban history cannot be written

                    discussion of the importance of history and the role of the historian, concerns to which this
                    pragmatic age increasingly forces us to attend.</p>
            <p>Next the student is led step by step along the road to completion of the historical thesis. Bearing
                    the elements of criticism in mind, he learns how to choose a subject, how to gather data, and about
                    problems of note taking. The latter part of this section incorporates the last part of the earlier
                    editions concerning composition of the master's essay, with somewhat more added about the
                    importance of good writing, which, again, reflects a hopeful modern trend.</p>
            <p>In this latest edition, the third section is entirely new, entitled "Beyond the Masters
                    Degree," and serves both to guide the aspirant for the Ph.D. in meeting the requirements,
                    and to sketch the opportunities open to the student of history. By taking note of current historical
                    activities in government, business history, and war history, the author serves not only those who
                    intend to teach but points out other important areas for the professional historian.</p>
            <p>Much of this last section is devoted to a brief survey of American historiography. In the
                    reviewer's opinion this is not happily inspired. Such information is treated better and
                    more at length in various other works with which candidates for the higher degree will necessarily
                    have to acquaint themselves. It must be admitted, however, that it performs a real service in
                    drawing attention to the efforts of private collectors, libraries, and historical societies usually
                    overlooked in surveys of historical scholarship.</p>
            <p>It may also be objected that in broadening the title of his work Professor Hockett misleads the
                    reader, for the work is still largely centered on the problems of writing <hi rend="i">American</hi>
                    history and the developments of historical study in America. But the author rightfully seeks in his
                    title to stress the critical method, not only because it deals with something essential to success
                    in writing history, "but because <pb n="221" id="VAA4025-053-2-099"/> it involves a
                    discipline of mind and character which everyone needs" (p. 72). Many will agree that for
                    these modern times history might well replace the study of traditional logic. Historians themselves
                    too often sell their subject short in counseling and teaching. Its methodology offers as much or
                    more for those who would learn as does its content.</p>
            <p>The use of exercises in criticism suggested in earlier editions has apparently been well received,
                    for eight such exercises are suggested, including the extensively developed one previously included
                    concerning Van Buren's role in the election of 1824–1825. The author has very
                    practically provided, too, a considerable body of information about how to find material. A
                    bibliographic summary draws attention to bibliographies of bibliographies, bibliographic information
                    in comprehensive works of history, biographical dictionaries, indexes to periodicals and newspapers,
                    catalagues of books, government publications and guides to them, and the intricacies of statutes,
                    documents, and court records.</p>
            <p>Towards the end of his discussion on requirements for the master's degree the author permits
                    himself some remarks on "some conditions that must be faced" (pp.
                    173–180) that tend to be somewhat lacking in direction. However interesting, his remarks
                    tend to be the kind that will soon be dated, and to some extent preachify. The reviewer would take
                    serious issue, too, with the statement on page 185 that it is advisable for candidates for the
                    doctorate to limit themselves to subjects which can be developed by the use of printed materials
                    rather than collections of manuscripts or archival matter. The National Archives, Library of
                    Congress, state libraries and historical societies are all bursting with manuscripts and documents
                    fit for the doctoral candidate to batten on with great profit to the more mature scholar who needs
                    the monographic studies that will result and who alone has achieved the breadth of view to make
                    meaningful general syntheses. Reworking of well-known printed materials by any but the most
                    brilliant graduate students seldom results in a worthwhile contribution. The author's
                    objections that the Ph.D. candidate lacks the special techniques for the work in archival or
                    manuscript sources and that he is customarily refused access to them is not borne out by the
                    experiences of most of them.</p>
            <pb n="222" id="VAA4025-053-2-100"/>
            <p>Altogether, despite these objections, it is with a sense of gratitude that the reviewer puts down
                    this work. So much useful information is here compiled, logically and conveniently, to spare the
                    mentor of aspiring students the effort that Hockett has performed for him, with a sensitivity and
                    grasp that most of us could not summon. The author teaches by example as well as precept, mirroring
                    implicity in his style the same lessons he discusses explicitly. Though possibly more pedestrian
                    than the similar works by Allan Nevins and Louis Gottschalk, and not as concise as Sherman <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s little manual, for the student interested in American history
                    Hockett's work is the most useful. Mixing stimulating generalizations with excellent
                    specific illustrations, the author should, in this work, imbue most readers with enthusiasm for
                    writing history.</p>

            <p>The subtitle of Professor Walter B. Rideout's study of the radical novel, "Some
                    Interrelations of Literature and Society," underscores the book's scope and
                    method. This is not only a history of a certain literary type, the radical or proletarian novel, in
                    a given period but also an attempt to explore the connections between the type and the society which
                    produced it. In a sense then this book has a double focus, and although the author shifts back and
                    forth easily, the reader sometimes gets the impression that in the effort to handle two subjects
                    adequately he has given neither in satisfactory detail.</p>
            <p>Professor Rideout defines the radical novel clearly: "A radical novel, then, is one which
                    demonstrates, either explicitly or implicitly, that its author objects to the human suffering
                    imposed by some socioeconomic system and <hi rend="i">advocates that the system be fundamentally
                        changed</hi>" (p. 12). Using this criterion, he then proceeds to examine over 160
                    novels published in the first half of the twentieth century and to point out their distinctions in
                    theme, characterization, and <pb n="223" id="VAA4025-053-2-101"/> technique. Moreover, he sketches a
                    doctrinal history of the period (particularly in chapters 6 and 8) in order to show the evolution of
                    Socialist and Marxist dogma in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Occasionally this exposition of the social and economic background breaks up into
                    accounts of internecine party squabbles and gets in the way of the analysis of the fiction. Since
                    many of the novelists considered here were associated with the <hi rend="i">Masses</hi> or <hi rend="i">New Masses,</hi> a full account of these periodicals is given, but others with less
                    actual or symbolic value are neglected.</p>
            <p>The narrowness of the definition is an unfortunate limitation. Novels which do not spectacularly
                    raise the red banner of revolt are in effect disregarded although their criticism of the economic
                    status quo might be more devastating than that in some of the fiction discussed. Thus the author
                    relegates John Steinbeck's <hi rend="i">In Dubious Battle</hi> to a footnote because it
                    does not fit his schematic formula although it is probably the best strike novel in American
                    literature. The work of Robert Herrick is bypassed, probably because of the mildness of its social
                    criticism, and both Upton Sinclair and John Dos Passos are accorded less space than their prominence
                    would seem to merit.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, Professor Rideout's book is a competent and lucid study. Important early
                    twentieth century novels like Friedman's <hi rend="i">By Bread Alone,</hi> Poole's
                        <hi rend="i">The Harbor,</hi> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s <hi rend="i">The Iron Heel</hi> are given close attention, and the later
                    work of Josephine Herbst, Robert Cantwell, Howard Fast, James Farrell, and Richard Wright is treated
                    adequately. Henry Roth's <hi rend="i">Call It Sleep</hi> (1935) receives the accolade of
                    "the most distinguished single proletarian novel." Professor Rideout has not only
                    plowed his way through a field of dreary, crude, uninspired fiction, much of it quite without
                    artistic pretension and certainly without readers today, but has classified it in regard to theme
                    and quality. He finds, for example, that proletarian fiction is concerned thematically with strikes,
                    the conversion of men to the cause, the coming of Socialism or Marxism, the squalid life of the
                    bottom dogs, and the supposed decadence and venality of the middle class. He sees little aesthetic
                    merit in most of this writing, chiefly because of the authors' addiction to melodrama and
                    violence, because of their oversimplified and therefore falsified characters, and because of their
                    compulsion to flaunt <pb n="224" id="VAA4025-053-2-102"/> their political dogma at all costs. He
                    observes also that most radical fiction has an urban locale and is <hi rend="i">not</hi> written by
                    authors who are themselves members of the working classes. The radical novel, as Upton
                    Sinclair's work so conspicuously illustrates, is more propaganda than art.</p>
            <p>As a final remark, one must commend the writer for his sense of balance and sanity. The radical novel
                    was one development of twentieth century American literature, but it was neither the sole
                    development nor the most important one. And today when the radical novel is almost moribund as a
                    type (Professor Rideout lists only fifteen titles from 1950 to 1954), it seems largely a soiled and
                    turbid backwater in the main stream of our letters.</p>

            <p>The development of science in early America is a subject which has not previously been treated in a
                    unified fashion, and therefore Mr. Hindle's book fills a long-standing deficiency in the
                    history of this period. The emphasis in this work is generally on the individuals who contributed to
                    the development of an early American science, and although it is possible to question whether the
                    many references to somewhat insignificant figures are entirely warranted, it must be admitted that
                    describing the growth of science in terms of the men who directed it has merit.</p>
            <p>In addition, Mr. Hindle has also attempted to show the effects which changing political and social
                    attitudes had on the growth of science in the colonies, and he has been successful in showing the
                    close relationship between science and colonial society.</p>
            <p>The first part of the book, "Colonial Circles and Ties, 1735–1765," is
                    concerned with the early efforts of Americans to associate themselves with the international
                    attempts to advance man's knowledge of the sciences. As the author shows, the European
                    legacy of the scientific revolution extended across the ocean and stimulated colonials to contribute
                        <pb n="225" id="VAA4025-053-2-103"/> their share. The Natural History Circle in the colonies,
                    assisted and encouraged by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> merchant, Peter Collinson, was quite extensive and contained such eminent men as James
                    Logan and John Bartram of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Also included among the early scientific amateurs in North America were a group of medical
                    practitioners, who, as might be expected, felt a strong interest in natural history. Cadwallader

                    </placeName>, and many others made valuable contributions to early American science.</p>
            <p>Quite naturally, the early American scientists, holding up to admiration such organizations as the
                    Royal Society of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the Academy of Sciences in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>, should have wished to achieve for themselves some form of co-operative scientific
                    institution. Their attempts to found societies for this purpose are described in detail by Hindle,
                    who shows how much the groups suffered from lack of interest, lack of facilities, and lack of a
                    cultured society in sufficient numbers to sustain a society over a period of years. Of all the
                    groups organized during the colonial period, perhaps the medical societies achieved the greatest
                    success. This was understandable in view of their common professional base.</p>
            <p>The coming of the American Revolution affected science in the colonies just as it affected every
                    other concern of the people. For one thing, it tended to make Americans conscious of their separate
                    destiny and of what means they possessed to fulfill it. Colonists developed a renewed interest in
                    science, especially in its relation to the promotion of better agriculture and to manufacturing. One
                    strong indication of this heightened interest is to be found in the revival of the Philosophical
                    Society, which had been formed in 1743 and then had faded away. In 1767 the Society took on a new
                    vigor, thanks to the activities of Thomas Bond, Edward Shippen, William Smith, and others. It soon
                    merged with the American Society, and thus was born a unified scientific group for North America.</p>
            <p>Hindle also points out that colonial interest in the sciences at this time was very much weighted
                    toward the idea of utility: science was to be studied because this study would produce something
                    beneficial or useful. This attitude <pb n="226" id="VAA4025-053-2-104"/> seems to have been
                    generally held throughout the entire period described.</p>
            <p>The outbreak of the War of the Revolution produced a new set of conditions for science and
                    scientists, and its general effect was one of disruption. There was, to be sure, no direct
                    interference from governments, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> and others worked diligently to keep open the channels of scientific communication
                    between the Old World and the New. However, the altering of life in the colleges, and the necessary
                    burdens of the war on those citizens who previously had led the pursuit of science—all
                    these factors contributed to a decline in interest and achievement in America.</p>
            <p>After the war the "Prophets of Glory," who were willing to assert on all occasions
                    the superiority of America to the Old World, did not neglect the sciences when they spoke of the
                    future. They painted a wonderful picture of the advances which would be made now that the arts and
                    sciences were no longer under subjection. However, as the author clearly shows, the new republic, in
                    comparison to Europe, had an intellectual environment which was substantially inferior.</p>
            <p>Still, strenuous efforts were made in the years of the early Republic. These included the vigorous
                    promotion of study in natural history, including its introduction into some of the colleges;
                    friendly relations with European correspondents in the realm of natural philosophy; and interest in
                    such subjects as astronomy, electricity, and magnetism.</p>
            <p>As the author indicates in the final chapter, America, in this period of fifty-four years, was not
                    able to make great and momentous contributions to the scientific knowledge of the world, but
                    Americans did share in the scientific interests of their parent continent. Perhaps the most
                    important fact is that many people of revolutionary America did achieve a sustained faith in the
                    good that could be derived from the pursuit of science, and to this they added a firm faith that
                    America was capable of creating an environment in which science could flourish. In terms of this
                    theme, and in terms also of the considerable information and documentation which characterize this
                    book, it must be regarded as one of the most valuable contributions to an understanding of early
                    American science.</p>

            <p>This brief volume is a very readable story of the period from 1763 to 1789, the formative years of
                    the American Republic. In fact, the reviewer feels that the chief value of the book lies in its
                    readability rather than in any new contribution it makes to our knowledge of the Revolutionary era.
                    As one of the volumes in the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s new series on the "History of American Civilization," the
                    book's main audience undoubtedly will be undergraduate students enrolled in survey courses.
                    Dr. Morgan's narrative should be able to hold the attention and interest of the general
                    reader.</p>
            <p>Dr. Morgan advocates the well-known theme that <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>'s New Colonial Policy after 1763—particularly the new policy of
                    taxation—was the main cause of the American Revolution. He claims that the colonial
                    leaders from the beginning were unalterably opposed to all parliamentary taxation of the colonists
                    for revenue purposes, regardless of whether these taxes were "internal" or
                    "external." Unfortunately, perhaps, he has presented a one-sided view of the
                    Revolution. After briefly discussing parliamentary taxation and the colonial response to
                    it—in chapters with the eye-catching titles of "Sugar and Stamps,"
                    "Peace Without Honor," and "Troops and Tea"—Dr.
                    Morgan asks the question: "Were the colonists sincere in their declarations of principle or
                    were they merely trying to avoid the unpleasant task of paying taxes that they ought to have
                    paid?" He then declares that the book "has proceeded on the conviction that the
                    colonists' attachment to principle was genuine" (p. 51). Although he acknowledges
                    that other historians may disagree with this theory, he often fails to give an adequate treatment of
                    the opposing views.</p>
            <p>Dr. Morgan looks upon the Revolution primarily as a revolt against <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and feels that the internal changes and disputes in the colonies were of secondary
                    importance. He states that the "most radical change produced in Americans by the Revolution
                    was in fact not a division at all but the union of three million cantankerous colonists into a new
                    nation" (p. 100). The rest of his story deals with the molding of this new nation, the
                    adoption of state constitutions, the <pb n="228" id="VAA4025-053-2-106"/> Articles of Confederation
                    and, finally, the Constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The author has much praise for the accomplishments of the government under the
                    Articles but recognizes the weaknesses of the government. In discussing the Constitutional
                    Convention, he refutes Charles Beard's interpretation and defends the patriotism and public
                    spirit of the members of that convention.</p>
            <p>Dr. Morgan's scholarship is irreproachable. In his earlier book, <hi rend="i">The Stamp Act
                        Crisis,</hi> he has given us one of the best accounts of parliamentary taxation and its
                    reception by the colonists. The theories he advanced in this previous volume have been repeated
                    here, but without elaboration. Space limitations imposed by the editors undoubtedly prevented him
                    from being more thorough. The use of some footnotes, if only a few, would have increased the value
                    of this book. In his very short bibliographical note Dr. Morgan could mention only a few authors,
                    yet the reviewer feels that the omission of such names as C. H. VanTyne, G. O. Trevelyan, and A. C.
                    McLaughlin—to mention several—was regrettable.</p>
            <p>To discuss coherently this important quarter-century in the space of 157 pages is indeed a difficult
                    task. Dr. Morgan has done a fine job of presenting his views on the subject. If this book attracts a
                    large audience among students and casual readers who prefer to do their reading "without
                    the trimmings," it will have served a worthy cause.</p>

                    Fritiof Ander. Augustana Library Publications, No. 27. (<placeName>

                    College Library, 1956. Pp. xix, 191. $3.00.)</head>
            <p>For a hundred years, Augustana College has been the special agent for the Royal Library of Stockholm
                    for the gathering of materials on Swedish immigration, and it now has the most extensive collection
                    in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The compiler of this bibliography is a distinguished member of the Augustana faculty
                    and has long been recognized as an authority on the Swedes in America. It was not surprising
                    therefore that the Swedish Pioneer Historical Society turned to Dr. Ander for the preparation of a
                    bibliography on Swedish <pb n="229" id="VAA4025-053-2-107"/> immigration, and that the American
                    Philosophical Society, the Social Science Research Council, Augustana College, and various other
                    organizations, gave the project their support. The result is a volume of which the author and his
                    sponsors can be justly proud.</p>
            <p>Dr. Ander modestly affirms that his work must not be regarded as "definitive," but
                    it is unlikely that anyone else will ever produce a more inclusive bibliography of Swedish
                    immigration. Anyone who has ever made even a select list of references will appreciate what a
                    back-breaking, time-consuming and exacting job the preparation of such a bibliography is. Few have
                    the expert knowledge, the patience and the stamina to complete such a huge undertaking. Dr. Ander is
                    primarily concerned with "Little Sweden" in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, that is, with immigrants still conscious that they are immigrants. Therefore, his
                    major attention is focused on immigrant sources. But because the history of Swedish immigration is
                    so closely interwoven with the whole history of nineteenth century Sweden, it was necessary to comb
                    the libraries and depositories on both sides of the Atlantic. In addition to the thousands of items
                    cited in this volume, the author tells us that his original manuscript, deposited in the Augustana
                    College Library, contains some 1500 additional English and Swedish titles, which will be made
                    available to interested scholars.</p>
            <p>Professor Ander's bibliography is divided into ten subdivisions. A reviewer can hardly do
                    more than indicate the contents of each section. First of all, there is a bibliography of
                    bibliographies, which includes not only printed materials but lists of references from M.A. and
                    Ph.D. theses on Swedish immigration. Chapter 2 deals with the background of the Swedish folk
                    migration, and demonstrates once more that emigration and immigration can never be sharply
                    separated. Chapter 3 is devoted to the many "America books" produced by immigrants
                    and travelers, and chapter 4 is concerned with emigrant guidebooks, including those prepared by
                    steamship, railroad and land companies. Chapter 5 deals with the general contributions of the
                    immigrants to American life, especially in agriculture and labor, and chapter 8 with their
                    activities in the realm of art, music and the theater. Chapters 6 and 7 are devoted to the church,
                    education, and religious and secular literature. Religion helped <pb n="230" id="VAA4025-053-2-108"/> the stranger in a strange land to preserve his identity; it became a compelling factor in the
                    life of most Swedish-American communities, and it particularly affected their literature and music.
                    Chapter 9 is devoted primarily to Swedish-American newspapers, periodicals, and annuals, for, like
                    other immigrant groups, the Swedes issued scores of foreign-language papers and periodicals. The
                    mortality rate among them was high, although both the religious and secular press generally appealed
                    to a larger community than the particular locality where the publications appeared. Incidentally, as
                    Professor Ander points out, letters to the editors are an important and still largely unexploited
                    source for the history of immigration. The final chapter deals with archival materials and a wide
                    variety of primary sources difficult to classify, and indicates the libraries, here and abroad,
                    where they may be found.</p>
            <p>The debt of the scholar to Dr. Ander for this exhaustive bibliography is immeasurable. It will be an
                    unfailing guide for students and scholars for many years to come. Each chapter is provided with a
                    short, historical introduction, which provides the reader with penetrating observations on various
                    phases of Swedish immigration. If this introductory material could be gathered together into an
                    uninterrupted narrative, it would in itself constitute an excellent short history of Swedish
                    immigration in the <placeName>

                    changing some dates. It could almost pass as a history of the development of legal education in the <placeName>

            <pb n="231" id="VAA4025-053-2-109"/>
            <p>It is essentially a reference book, a "who's who" of the deans, originally
                    wardens, of the teachers, and of some of the distinguished alumni of the School of Law at <placeName>

                    Some portrayed therein contributed greatly to the institution; others contributed little, if
                    anything.</p>
            <p>The writers start the story with the creation of a professorship of law in 1793 and the election of
                    James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName> to that professorship. In the winter of 1794 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName> gave two lectures a week to seven students and thirty-six auditors. In his next series
                    of lectures, given the following winter, only two students appeared. In the third year none came,
                    but in the year following half a dozen attended. During this time, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been elected to the assembly, appointed recorder of the City of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, and finally appointed to a judgeship on the Supreme Court of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. After <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName> resigned his professorship in early 1798, this small and uncertain beginning of legal
                    education lay dormant at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> for a quarter century.</p>
            <p>In 1823, when <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName> retired as chancellor and came back to <placeName>

                    </placeName> City, he was again elected to the professorship of law and started a new series of
                    lectures which continued over the next three years and which were better attended. In 1826 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName> abandoned his lecturing, not because of a lack of students but because of the demands
                    of his private practice. He continued as professor of law in name only for another twenty years,
                    until his death, but he never lectured again.</p>
            <p>The importance of these lectures is not so much the offering of legal education at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but rather that these lectures furnished the basis for his four volumes of <hi rend="i">Commentaries,</hi> published between 1826 and 1830, which had a tremendous impact upon
                    the whole legal profession in this country.</p>
            <p>It is doubtful that it could properly be said that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>
                    </placeName> founded the School of Law at Columbia University. At best, he was but its prophet.</p>
            <p>The real credit for the founding of the School of Law must go to Theodore W. Dwight who was appointed
                    to the professorship of law in 1852, and who for the next twenty years gave all the instruction in
                    law. Dwight ran the School of Law almost as a proprietary institution for nearly forty <pb n="232" id="VAA4025-053-2-110"/> years. He taught one course at a time and used textbooks exclusively, a
                    method now looked upon with horror by the law teaching profession. Yet so effective were
                    Dwight's comments, so thought-provoking his questions, that he inspired in his students a
                    desire to learn more for themselves.</p>
            <p>Although several additional members joined the law faculty and a School actually existed, it became
                    increasingly clear that the School of Law was Theodore W. Dwight. The president of Columbia
                    University insisted in 1890 upon a curricular overhaul, and brought to the law faculty Professor
                    William Albert Keener, of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> Law School faculty, a strong advocate of the case system of teaching law. On the
                    retirement of Dwight soon after, Keener became dean, and the case system was adopted, to be enriched
                    throughout the years following by the faculty under the wise guidance of Harlan Fisk Stone, Young B.
                    Smith, and others.</p>
            <p>The history of the Columbia University School of Law illustrates the dispute over what law teaching
                    should be. Should it be only a teaching of craft skills, or should it include also an understanding
                    of the problems of the society in which those skills will be used? This book indicates that Columbia
                    University School of Law has done a satisfactory job in both directions.</p>

                    "professional" managers. The book represents a logical extension or refinement of
                    the thesis of A. A. Berle, Jr., and G. C. Means in <hi rend="i">The Modern Corporation and Private
                        Property</hi> (1932).</p>
            <p>Modern managers are no longer major stockholders or of the family. Furthermore, the officials are not
                    well known. Advertising and public relations extol the products and <pb n="233" id="VAA4025-053-2-111"/> company name. The shift in the type of executive from owners, founders,
                    and plungers prompted investigation of the personal qualifications. Major corporations were selected
                    for the years 1900, 1925, and 1950. Detailed data was unearthed on the president and the chairman of
                    the board in the firms as of the three years.</p>
            <p>Dr. Newcomer is at her best in treating the variety of exectuive backgrounds, yet her modal man is
                    intriguing: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The typical executive of 1950 is a native American, the son of a small, independent business
                            man. His family's income was moderate, and such jobs as he pursued during his
                            boyhood were for extra spending money rather than to help support the family. His parents
                            managed to put him through college, with such contributions as he himself made to his own
                            expenses through part-time employment, mostly in summer. Upon graduation he obtained a
                            full-time job, with no assistance from his family. Thenceforward he was on his own. While
                            still relatively young and inexperienced he obtained a minor position with the corporation
                            that he eventually headed, and he gradually worked up, through operations or production, to
                            a vice presidency, from which he was promoted to the presidency at the age of fifty-two.
                            Although he has had specialized professional training, he has never practiced independently,
                            nor has he at any time run a business of his own as his father did. He is a business
                            administrator—a bureaucrat—with little job experience outside his own
                            corporation. His investments in "his" company are nominal, in terms of
                            potential control—less than 0.1 percent of the total stock outstanding. He is a
                            Republican in politics; he attends the Episcopalian church, if he attends church at all; and
                            he served the federal government in an advisory capacity during the war. He was, in 1950,
                            sixty-one years of age, and he will probably be seventy when he retires, (p. 149).</p>

            </p>
            <p>Concern is expressed over the departure of the mode from the ideal. The self-perpetuating arrangement
                    with internal advancement unduly limits the choice of successors. Senior executives come into power
                    too late to develop long term policies. The more dynamic companies in terms of growth appointed
                    younger officials than the relatively static companies. There is seemingly more democracy now as
                    compared with 1900 in the race for the top. The poor college graduate has a better chance than ever
                    before. Swelling ranks of products of schools of business administration may soon furnish an
                    increasing number of leaders. Dr. Newcomer approves of the shifts since 1900 but not without
                    sophisticated reservations. Her book represents important reading for students of corporate
                    management whether they be in <pb n="234" id="VAA4025-053-2-112"/> the classrooms of universities
                    and colleges or members of boards of directors wondering how to keep their corporate houses in good
                    hands.</p>
            <p>The book should be fascinating to those who dreamed of success in the ulcerous profession of top
                    management yet somehow were shunted or wandered into another pursuit. Everyone can locate the point
                    or points where he left or quit climbing on the corporate ladder of success.</p>

            <p>In the revised and enlarged edition of American Issues the editors have attempted to strengthen some
                    sections of their earlier anthology (1941 and 1944) and, by the addition of recent material which
                    illustrates the turbulent days since the close of World War II, they have sought to give the present
                    publication contemporary significance. Here is in part (and a very sizable part at that) a written
                    record of American life—American thought and action as reflected in this collection of
                    readings and documents. The coverage of these two volumes is intended to present a well-rounded
                    picture of our political, social, and cultural development. Naturally, many authors, beginning with
                    John Smith and Increase Mather and concluding with Karl Shapiro and Reinhold Niebuhr, are included.
                    In short, here are northerners, southerners, easterners, and westerners responding to the issues
                    confronting them.</p>
            <p>The first volume, <hi rend="i">The Social Record,</hi> points out these issues which have permeated
                    our society. The vast array of speeches, essays, letters, pamphlets, and excerpts from biographies
                    and autobiographies are arranged chronologically under twenty-four special topics—for
                    example, "The Struggle for Freedom," and "The Passing of the
                    Frontier." The editors introduce each topic by interpretive comments which are lucid and
                    discerning. The second volume, <hi rend="i">The Literary Record,</hi> includes "only such
                    writing as can honestly be said to <pb n="235" id="VAA4025-053-2-113"/> show the artist's
                    hand at work, consciously shaping his material" (p. v). But much of our literature is an
                    outgrowth, consciously or unconsciously, of the basic issues which have been covered in the first
                    volume. Hence the editors believe that for an understanding of American literature a thorough
                    knowledge of social history is necessary. In addition, the editors consider a chronological
                    presentation of fewer authors to be more effective than a hodge-podge of everything, as is the case
                    with many anthologies of literature. In both volumes short biographical accounts and provocative
                    head-notes give background material for each writer included.</p>
            <p>One question seems pertinent. Is the basic division of the material justified? Some readers may
                    question the loose use of the term "social" and the rigid rule by which a
                    particular literary writing was included or excluded. When is a piece of writing the conscious
                    creation of the artist's imaginative mind? It is not the intention of the present reviewer
                    to discuss what is or what is not a work of art but rather to point out that the editors by their
                    predetermined classification have had to overcome an inherent weakness of the anthology by
                    arbitrarily assigning certain writings to categories which may be debatable. Furthermore, by lifting
                    a selection from an author and fitting it into an editorial pigeonhole, the reader may not arrive at
                    a proper perspective of the author. Although it is customary to include in texts of American
                    literature excerpts from the journal of Sarah Kemble Knight and portions of the diary of Samuel
                    Sewall, now that the editors have compiled a social history some readers will ask whether the
                    writings of Sewall and Knight are not more appropriate for the social than the literary record. It
                    is the age-old problem of how to organize your material after you have diligently gathered it. For
                    the most part, the editors have done well, but the very nature of their organization and the
                    division of these two volumes will cause some disagreement.</p>
            <p>Many anthologies raise the question of inclusion and exclusion; and in the case of the <hi rend="i">American Issues</hi> the question is not concerned with each separate volume but the volumes as
                    a whole. One of the good qualities of this work is the variety of material presented, some of which
                    is not easily accessible elsewhere. In fact, the <hi rend="i">Social Record</hi> contains many more
                    writings than would ordinarily be expected. In <pb n="236" id="VAA4025-053-2-114"/> regard to the
                        <hi rend="i">Literary Record</hi> the editors may have achieved their stated objective (a
                    sampling of fewer authors), but some critics will assert that this approach is not necessarily more
                    "profitable." These critics will say that the <hi rend="i">Literary Record</hi> is
                    but a pale reflection compared with the all-inclusive light emanating from the Social Record. Here
                    again is the incessant problem of how many trees does one have to observe before he can see the
                    forest. Does it require the writings of many authors or not so many?</p>
            <p>Then there is the problem of which and how much of an author's prose or poetry should be
                    included. The convenient and partial solution lies much within the purpose and whims of the editors.
                    Thus the editorial answer to this problem becomes a matter of selectivity which in turn may cause
                    disagreement among the readers. For example, there is in the opinion of this reviewer an adequate
                    amount of Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s writing but an inadequate proportion with respect to William
                    Bradford's.</p>
            <p>Of the two volumes, the <hi rend="i">Social Record</hi> shows superior editorial workmanship. The
                    selections listed under each basic issue usually illustrate what the editors intended the writings
                    to do. The <hi rend="i">Literary Record,</hi> with its chronological listing of the authors and
                    their works, is just another survey of American literature which does not indicate clearly the
                    relationship of the literary movements (romanticism, realism, etc.) to the dominant issues outlined
                    in the social history. It is true that there are some allusions to the issues in the various
                    biographical accounts of the authors, but it is questionable whether or not the reader will readily
                    understand the interrelationship implied by the title. The title, <hi rend="i">American Issues,</hi>
                    is appropriate for the <hi rend="i">Social Record,</hi> but it is not for the <hi rend="i">Literary
                        Record.</hi> The latter volume also appears to have been hastily revised. Why was there very
                    little revision of the biographical notes of several of the contemporary writers? For example, the
                    introductory comments about Ernest Hemingway leave him in the 1940's. Did not Hemingway and
                        <hi rend="i">The Old Man and the Sea</hi> make quite a literary splash in 1952? This reviewer
                    also questions the reprinting of The <hi rend="i">Scarlet Letter</hi> by Nathaniel Hawthorne,
                    especially since this novel is easily accessible elsewhere, including paperbound editions, and since
                    the editors have apologized for the lack of space.</p>
            <pb n="237" id="VAA4025-053-2-115"/>
            <p>The volumes are splendidly bound, and the index is good. For an easy place reference on the page
                    there are marginal notations indicating the number of lines. Another admirable feature of these
                    volumes is the date (found at the end of the selection) when each selection was written. The
                    technical and mechanical errors were held to a minimum. John Winthrop supervised the departure of

                    which boldly asserts its claim to a place on any private or public library shelf. This reviewer
                    suggests that the publisher consider a third volume, one dealing primarily with official state
                    papers and political documents; then the set would attain unquestionable uniqueness and usefulness
                    in the areas most frequently needed by serious students of American civilization.</p>

            <p>With that rare combination of historical accuracy, fluent style, and editorial selection displayed so
                    capably in his 1947 bestseller, <hi rend="i">The Lincoln Reader,</hi> Paul Angle has once again
                    produced a volume useful not only to the history major but <pb n="238" id="VAA4025-053-2-116"/> also
                    to the average American. This volume, as the subtitle indicates, consists of "great
                    documents of American liberty." As the author has pointed out, a document in itself is
                    often something less than exciting reading. Placed in its contemporary setting, however, with
                    carefully written introductions that scintillate and enlighten, each document can take on a
                    significance and interest for the modern reader which might otherwise be totally lacking. Mr.
                    Angle's success with this plan is evident from the fact that this volume, like <hi rend="i">The Lincoln Reader,</hi> was chosen as an offering by one of the national book clubs.</p>
            <p>In the selection of the forty-six documents which mark more than three centuries of American thought
                    and progress, Mr. Angle's choice fell on those that exemplified "two themes that
                    have distinguished American history from the beginning: the growth of democratic government, and the
                    evolution and defense of individual liberty." The author's choice here was a
                    judicious one about which there should be little if any quibbling. While the selections range from
                    the Mayflower Compact to Eisenhower's First Inaugural Address, there is a unity about the
                    series that is evident from the beginning.</p>
            <p>The first nine documents, covering the colonial period, are highlighted by Andrew <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s brilliant defense of freedom of the press in the Zenger Case and James
                    Otis' speech against writs of assistance. Eleven more documents carry the series from the
                    Confederation period to 1854. The twelve documents that cover the Civil War and Reconstruction era
                    begin with John Brown's Last Speech (1859) and end with President Johnson's 1866
                    message to Congress in which he pleaded for reunion without vengeance. The latter nineteenth
                    century, notably lacking in any number of great documents, statements, or messages, is represented
                    by a single document, namely, Governor Peter Altgeld's famous protest to President <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> against using the regular army to break <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Pullman strike. For the twentieth century thirteen documents were chosen,
                    the bulk of them from the statements of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt does
                    not appear in the selections.</p>
            <p>The selection of court decisions is interesting, to say the least. Of the six which Mr. Angle has
                    seen fit to include, one, <hi rend="i">Commonwealth</hi> v. <hi rend="i">Hunt</hi> (1842), is from a
                    state court; one, <pb n="239" id="VAA4025-053-2-117"/> the <hi rend="i">Ulysses</hi> decision of
                    1933, is from a <placeName>

            <p>In the reviewer's opinion errors of fact in the historical introductions are practically

                    </placeName> in 1941 was not in fact "unanimous" (p. 515), although it certainly
                    was close to being so. Three days later the declaration of war against <placeName>

            <p>Richard M. Brace's <hi rend="i">The Making of the Modern World</hi> was published as a
                    companion volume to Stewart Easton's <hi rend="i">The Heritage of The Past</hi> and covers
                    the period from the Renaissance to the present. In keeping with a current trend in texts of this
                    kind, Professor Brace has greatly expanded the material in the "non-European"
                    chapters—e.g., those on Asia and America—in an attempt to give the
                    "European" chapters a more adequate and proper frame of reference. Moreover, an
                    effort has been made in this text to arrive at a better balance between purely political
                    developments and those of a social, economic, or intellectual nature. In this respect, however, it
                    is this reviewer's opinion that Easton's <hi rend="i">Heritage</hi> is superior to
                    Professor Brace's volume.</p>
            <p>Considered as a textbook <hi rend="i">The Making of the Modern World</hi> may well prove to be a
                    strong contender in the "second-semester European Civilization" field. There is an
                    introductory chapter entitled "Europe's Inheritance in 1500" which, in
                    thirty-odd pages, concisely and helpfully sets the stage for the main themes of European history of
                    the last four and a half centuries. Most instructors who are familiar with the retention curve of
                    students between the first semester's final examination period and the opening lecture of
                    the second semester will probably feel that chapters of this kind have a definite place in college
                    history textbooks. In addition, <hi rend="i">The Making of the Modern World</hi> has illustrations
                    which actually illustrate the text material, adequate bibliographies at the end of each chapter, and
                    a series of excellent maps, many of which do more than simply indicate boundary changes at the
                    conclusions of wars—e.g., one captioned "The Expansion of Political Democracy in
                    Europe (after 1914)."</p>
            <p>Perhaps the strongest suit of this volume, however, is the author's willingness to
                    subordinate the traditional national and/or chronological emphasis found in "European
                    Civilization" texts to a broader topical approach. It may be argued, on a "first
                    things first" basis, that current freshman-student knowledge of European history demands
                    the foundation provided by the "nation by nation, king by king" <pb n="241" id="VAA4025-053-2-119"/> approach. On the other hand, for the vast majority of European
                    Civilization students, for whom the survey course is the first and last such course, it would seem
                    preferable to expose them to more of the ideas and theories <hi rend="i">behind</hi> the specific
                    episodes of European history than to count on their retaining the details of the episodes
                    themselves. Thus, Professor Brace has devoted considerable space to discussion of such topics as
                    "Absolutism," "Revolutionary Ideas," and "Reactionary
                    and Liberal Tendencies," thereby providing the student with broad frameworks of ideas which
                    are illustrated and demonstrated in those chapters which deal with separate national histories. In
                    this way, <hi rend="i">The Making of the Modern World</hi> may help to solve a common problem of
                    European Civilization students, i.e., the bewildering effect of being jerked abruptly from dynasty
                    to dynasty and from nation to nation, with the most apparent objectives being to cover a certain
                    number of centuries and to include the "powerful" nations.</p>

                    </placeName>, D.C.: Public Affairs Press, 1955. Pp. 520. Illustrations, maps, and index.
                    $6.00.)</head>
            <p>This volume includes more than a thousand illustrations of every conceivable type—rare
                    prints, old engravings, posters, lithographs, daguerreotypes, photographs, and cartoons. Integrated
                    with the illustrations are several thousand words of text which provide a narrative of the growth of
                    the G.O.P. from its origin in 1854 to the Eisenhower administration.</p>
            <p>The author is the political science editor of Public Affairs Press. He points out in the preface that
                    while the work might well have been impossible without the co-operation of the Republican National
                    Committee, it is in no sense an authorized work, and it was prepared independently of the Republican
                    party.</p>
            <p>The book presents the outward aspects of various stages of the development of the Republican party.
                    It contains vivid pictorial material, and is particularly strong in portraits of presidential
                    candidates of the G.O.P. All Republican presidential <pb n="242" id="VAA4025-053-2-120"/> candidates
                    from John C. Fremont to Eisenhower are shown in individual pictures, in family groups, and at
                    official functions surrounded by party heroes.</p>
            <p>Republicans will find the materials selected and the subjects emphasized far more congenial and
                    satisfactory to their conceptions of the history of the last century than will Democrats. Many of
                    the cartoons, posters, and other pictorial selections taken from dramatic and emotional episodes
                    insinuate the superior virtues of the Republicans. The misfortunes of the Grant and Harding
                    administrations are dealt with so lightly that they escape notice. One would never suspect from the
                    material, aside from some election maps, that either Woodrow Wilson or Franklin D. Roosevelt
                    existed. There are many pleasing pictures of Hughes, Hoover, Landon, Willkie, and Dewey. But, after
                    all, it is a pictorial history of the Grand Old Party!</p>
            <p>In these days of mass culture, perhaps it is understandable that experiments in reaching large
                    numbers of people through pictures as the chief means of communication will be attempted. But the
                    reviewer is not convinced by anything which has yet come to his attention that effective
                    presentation of history is possible by this device. "History" is
                    "inquiry," and to inquire is to ponder, to speculate, to search for truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Grand Old Party, a Pictorial History</hi> is superficial, has no concern with
                    philosophical undercurrents, and no intellectual appeal. In short, while it has some interest for
                    those interested in history, it is not in itself history.</p>

            <p>Explicit in this publication is the viewpoint that it is neither possible nor desirable to save all
                    public records; hence selection of those to be preserved (or destroyed) is inevitable. This bulletin
                    discusses general principles for determining which records should be preserved. It wisely indicates
                    the need for archivists to consult with scholars who use the records, but it unfortunately seems to
                    relegate the latter to a somewhat minor role in the actual decisions about what is to be saved.</p>

                    </placeName> early in 1956 on historical research in American philanthropy. Attention was given to
                    the need for more and especially for better research on "widespread voluntary
                    giving" which "is an almost unique characteristic of the <placeName>

                    such research, and topics which might be worthy of special study were listed. Slightly more than
