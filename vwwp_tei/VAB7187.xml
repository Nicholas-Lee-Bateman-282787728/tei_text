                <head>PREFACE.</head>
                <p><hi>MANY</hi> young people, and especially widows and single ladies, when they
                    first possess money of their own, are in want of advice when they have
                    commonplace business matters to transact. It is not always easy for them to find
                    a friend who will listen patiently to their difficulties, and express no
                    surprise at their ignorance, which has made me see how much a little Manual of
                    this kind has been wanted. Numerous excellent works are published (see p. 121
                    for a list of them), but the mistake their Authors generally make is in
                    supposing the Reader to know something of business. I write for those who know
                        <emph>nothing</emph>. My aim throughout is to avoid all technicalities; to
                    give plain and practical direc‐<pb n="vii" xml:id="VAB7187-004"></pb> tions, not
                    only as to what ought to be done, but how to do it.</p>
                <p>Ladies rarely have any business to attend to before they attain the age of
                    twenty‐one. They are usually older when, through their father’s or their
                    husband’s death, they find themselves possessed of money of their own, and are
                    then first called upon to act. They naturally feel shy and awkward, at that time
                    of life, in asking such a simple question as, How am I to draw a Cheque? How
                    should I write to my Banker to send me some money? I want to sell out of the
                    Stocks, what must I do? How am I to get a Power of Attorney? When once known, a
                    person soon finds that all these things are very simple, and as soon forgets how
                    difficult and strange they once appeared to her. I trust this little book will
                    prove useful to many of those who have yet to learn.</p>

                    <head>INVESTMENTS.</head>
                    <p><hi>WHEN</hi> an inexperienced person comes into possession of her fortune,
                        and especially if it be a small one, her first inquiry is, “How can I invest
                        my money so as to get the highest possible interest?” Let her rather seek to
                        place it where her <term>Capital</term> will be <emph>safest</emph>. (By
                        Capital and Principal is meant her fortune, or the whole sum she possesses.)
                        The Duke of Wellington used to say “High interest is another name for bad<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7187-006"></pb> security.” In this country 4½ per cent. is
                        generally the highest <emph>safe</emph> Interest you can receive: 4 per
                        cent. more usually so. When 6, 7, 8, or more per cent. is offered by Banks,
                        Mortgages, Loans, or Mines, beware of accepting it, as the probability is
                        that you will lose both your Principal and Interest, as so many have done.
                        Such an Interest cannot be given consistently with the safety of the
                        concern.</p>
                    <p>Good Mortgages, and the Debenture Bonds of the leading Railway and Canal
                        Companies, are very <emph>convenient</emph> investments for persons of small
                        means, because the investors will at the end receive back the
                            <emph>same</emph> sum they originally put in, and in the meantime
                        receive an <emph>unvarying amount</emph> of Interest paid
                            <emph>regularly</emph>; also, in the case of a Railway or other Company
                        not being wholly successful, the Interest of its Bonds, &amp;c. is paid
                            <emph>before</emph> the Dividends of the Shareholders.</p>
                    <p><term>Joint‐Stock Banks.</term>—A lady should not on <emph>any account</emph>
                        take any Shares whatever in a Joint‐<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7187-007"></pb> Stock
                        Bank, Mine, Partnership, or any other joint trading concern, unless it be
                        established under the new “Limited Liability” Act, as otherwise she is
                        liable to lose her last penny if the Bank or speculation should fail. Even
                        if “limited,” they should not be invested in without the greatest possible
                        caution, nor until after very careful inquiries have been satisfactorily
                        answered.</p>
                    <p><term>Shares</term> in Railways, Canals, Gas and Water Works, may often prove
                        good investments, but some risk necessarily attends them, as may be seen by
                        the value of the Shares constantly rising and falling. The Interest or
                        Dividend they pay is constantly changing, according to the state of trade,
                        demand, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>These sorts of investments pay from 3 to 9 per cent.—sometimes even more, and
                        sometimes much less—to original Shareholders (that is, to those who took
                        Shares at the beginning of the concern), and from 3 to 5 per cent. to those
                        who purchase Shares. Where the Company is equally success‐<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7187-008"></pb> ful year after year, their Interest is steady and
                        safe, as it arises from the regular and large demand for gas and water, or
                        the traffic on the railway or canal.</p>
                    <p><term>Guaranteed and Preference Shares</term> are far safer investments than
                        ordinary Shares. By the former are meant Shares which, if a certain fixed
                        Dividend cannot be paid by the Company which guarantees them. They therefore
                        cannot be paid less, but if the property be thriving they participate in the
                        surplus. For Preference Shares, see Chap. IV.</p>
                    <p><emph>Do not put all your money into one concern</emph>. Put it into several.
                        Then if one fails in value another probably rises, and so your income will
                        keep more equal: if one of your investments unfortunately turns out a
                        failure, you lose only a part and not the whole of your fortune. When you
                        think you have placed your money in the<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7187-009"></pb>
                        safest way you can, do not alter its investment without some good reason.
                        Every change costs money, and is attended with trouble and anxiety.</p>
                    <p><term>In investing</term> Capital, attend to the following suggestions:—</p>

                    <p>2dly. <term>Asking advice.</term>—Seek a sensible and upright Friend, who is
                        a good man of business, to consult as to what concerns are safe or unsafe
                        for investments. Many worthy men are bad men of business, and recommend
                        investments because they think or hear they are good, without knowing
                        anything of the matter: and for that reason seldom consult ladies, as
                        usually they know little or nothing of business, and when that is the case
                        it is much like the blind leading the blind. Men who are in business are in
                        the habit of looking out for investments for their own money, and of hearing
                        competent opinions upon<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7187-010"></pb> them; and if they
                        are upright in their dealings and are doing well in the world, it is fair to
                        presume that their judgment is good. Having found one, be guided by him, and
                        do not ask everybody’s opinion, which only unsettles you.</p>
                    <p><term>Imposition.</term>—To show how easily an inexperienced man may be
                        imposed upon, I may mention an anecdote I heard from a person who had been
                        almost persuaded by a friend, who knew nothing of business, to take some
                        Shares in a Company which promised extremely good interest. He went to the
                        office, which was in the City, to make inquiries. The Manager tried much to
                        persuade him to invest, assuring him of the safety of the concern. While C—
                        was hesitating, a man rushed in, and said in an eager tone, “Pray, Sir, have
                        you any more Shares on sale? I have an order for fifty more, they are in
                        such great request that I am afraid of their being all sold before I can get
                        enough.” His manner and words opened C—’s eyes, who suspected that<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7187-011"></pb> this was a plan to entrap him to invest, and in
                        quietly walked off. The Company failed in a very short time afterwards.</p>

                        a great mistake to suppose that a long letter gets more attention; it is

                        it becomes<pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7187-015"></pb> to fold them of one size and

                    <head>KEEPING ACCOUNTS.</head>
                    <p>No one should be satisfied without keeping regular accounts of what she
                        receives and what she spends. She then knows what she has, and how it is
                        spent; and if at the end of the year her expenditure has exceeded her
                        income, she can refer to her books and see where to retrench. A person who
                        keeps no accounts may be compared to a ship without a chart. She goes on
                        without knowing where she is. There are many ways of keeping accounts which
                        it would be beyond the limits of this book to go into, but the way you can
                        easiest understand is the best to adopt. Once a month, transfer from your
                        daily Account‐book to another Book, called a Ledger, what you have spent
                        during that month, and place the items under different heads. For instance,
                        under the head “Dress” put all you have spent in dress; under “Amusements,”
                        all that you have<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7187-017"></pb> spent in that way. Every
                        year add these up, and then you will see at a glance how your income has
                        gone, where you have exceeded and where you have saved. Have no Christmas
                        Bills; pay all creditors once a week, and your servants once a month or
                        quarter. You then know how you stand; you feel out of debt with everybody;
                        you cannot easily be imposed upon, because you can readily look back a week
                        to see that your Bills are correct, though you are perplexed in looking back
                        for a year.</p>

                        when Payments should be made. Some people have a page for a “Statement of

                    <p><term>Sharing Expenses.</term>—In travelling with a friend on the Continent,
                        it is sometimes difficult to divide the expenses correctly. I therefore
                        insert an example. When the expenses of two or more persons are included in
                        one account, their respective shares will be most readily separated by
                        adopting the following form. We will suppose A. and B. to be at an hotel in
                        France, and their landlord to have entered everything they have ordered,
                        whether jointly or separately, into a single Bill. The Bill occupies the
                        right‐hand compartment of the table; in the left‐hand compartment are the
                        calculations of A. and B., which would probably be made on a separate bit of
                        paper. The principle is to have three columns; one for A.’s peculiar
                        expenses, one for B.’s, and one for common expenses. The sum of the common
                        expenses is halved, and one of the halves is added to A.’s column and the
                        other half to B.’s. Finally, A. and B.’s shares are added together to see
                        that their sum tallies with the amount of the Bill.</p>

                        and date of each note. Should all or any of these notes be stolen, lost, or
                        mislaid, immediately write to or call upon your Banker, supplying the above
                        information, and measures will at once be taken to “<term>stop</term>” or
                        refuse payment of them; and for another reason it is an excellent plan to
                        write your name or your initials, with the date of receiving it, at the back
                        of each note, in order to identify among others, in case of any

                    <p>Inexperienced persons should pause before they consent to sign their name to
                        any Document, and particularly before signing and putting their<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7187-026"></pb> finger on the seal and saying the cabalistic
                        words, “I deliver this as my Act and Deed.” Let them understand
                            <emph>well</emph> what it is they are undertaking the responsibility of,
                        and that by signing they may imperil their last shilling. But none need feel
                        anxiety in <term>witnessing a person’s signature to a Deed</term>. The act
                        is one that cannot compromise him, and it is a social duty to perform, for
                        he is sure at some time to have need of the same assistance in his own
                        behalf. Considerable inconvenience is sometimes caused in country places by
                        a friend declining to do this simple act of kindness.</p>

                        business papers, that it may be recognised, and make it
                            <emph>distinct</emph> as possible. Many whose writing is in other
                        respects clear and legible, sign their names in such a manner that it is
                        almost impossible to recognise them.</p>

                    <head>BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS WITH FRIENDS.</head>
                    <p>In <term>transacting business</term>, such as buying or selling Stocks,
                        Railway Shares, and especially Land, or in any money affairs, even with the
                        nearest relation, make it a rule that everything be transacted in the same
                        formal business‐like manner that would be adopted if he were a stranger.
                        Were this rule attended to, frequent annoyances, much expense, and many
                        family quarrels would be avoided. In disputed cases, resulting from the
                        absence of a business‐like understanding, friends and relations
                            <emph>may</emph> become satisfied by mutual concessions and confidence
                        in one another’s integrity; but when they die, their Executors are bound to
                        act by the hard judgment of the law.</p>
                    <p><term>Saleable Title.</term>—When Shares or Land are given or sold to you by
                        a relation or others, ask your legal adviser to see that all necessary steps
                        are taken for making your Title a <emph>saleable</emph> one, so<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7187-029"></pb> that you can sell the property whenever you may
                        desire to do so, without trouble or extra expense.</p>
                    <p><term>Security.</term>—If you lend money as an investment, always take every
                        precaution to obtain a safe security for it from the Borrower—viz. a
                        Mortgage of Land or other Property, worth at least, in the case of Land,
                        one‐third more, and in the other case, half as much again as the sum you
                        lend.</p>
                    <p><term>Receipts from Friends</term>.—<emph>Always take a Receipt or
                            Acknowledgment</emph> from a relation, as from a stranger, for borrowed
                        money. Should your relation die, his Executors could not pay you unless you
                        had a Receipt or some other proof of debt to show, or he had named it in his
                        Will. Executors must act only on legal evidence or pursuant to (<choice>

                        their own discretion.</p>
                    <p>If you have lent a person money, when he pays it back, you will have to
                        return the Receipt<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7187-030"></pb> he gave you. If this is
                        done through the Post, or through another person, take the precaution of
                        tearing or defacing the receipt before sending it.</p>
                    <p>Do not lend a Deed or Map of your property to any person without the advice
                        of your Attorney, and in any event desire the person who borrows it to give
                        you a Receipt for it. An old Map of Land is often a most important document
                        to determine boundaries.</p>

                        Interest. If it is a very large amount you can put it into the Funds or buy

                <argument>
                    <p><hi>WHEN</hi> you have fixed upon a Banker, and placed some money in his
                        hands, he will give you a book, called a Pass‐book, or Bank‐book.</p>
                </argument>
                <div type="section">
                    <head>BANK OR PASS‐BOOK.</head>
                    <p>The Banker will enter on one side of this book all the money that is paid
                        into the Bank by yourself or by others for you. These sums are called
                        Credits, and that side of the book is called <abbr type="superscription">Cr.</abbr>, short for Creditor. On the other side he will put down from
                        time to time the money you have drawn out of the Bank, by Cheques, or
                            Orders.<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7187-034"></pb> These sums drawn out are called
                        Debits, and that side of the book <abbr type="superscription">Dr.</abbr>, or
                        Debtor.</p>
                    <p>Never write anything <emph>yourself</emph> in your Pass‐book, for it should
                        be entirely written up by the Banker from time to time from his Ledger, of
                        which it considered to be a copy, and it is then legal evidence, as against
                        him, of the state of your account. Every six months, or better still, once a
                        month, your Pass‐book should be sent to the Bank to be “<term>made
                        up</term>,” that is, to have all money paid into the Bank, and all money
                        drawn out of the Bank, entered into it. The sums of the entries on each page
                        are carried forward to the next corresponding page, until the time arrives
                        for balancing the book, which is generally done at Midsummer and Christmas.
                        This will show that all is entered properly, it enables you to know at a
                        glance what money you have in the Bank, and prevents your “<term>overdrawing
                            your account</term>” (this means, drawing a Cheque to a greater amount
                        than you have money in the Bank). An account should never be overdrawn,
                        unless there has been<pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7187-035"></pb> a previous
                        arrangement with the Banker to that effect.</p>
                    <p>When you want your Bank‐book “<term>making up</term>,” write to your Banker,
                        enclosing it, or take it yourself, and ask him “to make it up.” Bankers
                        will, if desired, send a statement of your account on thin paper, which is
                        especially convenient to persons travelling abroad. A Pass‐book may now be
                        sent by Book Post for one penny, if its weight is under four ounces.</p>
                    <p><term>Sums of Money in a Banker’s hands.</term>—As a general rule, it is
                        considered unhandsome to have less money in a Bank than a hundred pounds.
                        The Bankers gain nothing for the trouble they take in receiving your money
                        and paying your Cheques, and running the risk of fraud, except by the
                        interest they obtain upon the sum you have placed in their hands.</p>

                    <p>Formerly it was not legal to draw a Cheque for a sum under One Pound, but
                        there is now no restriction in this respect. It is better however not to be
                        in the <emph>habit</emph> of drawing Cheques for very small amounts, say
                        under £5. You can easily pay small sums yourself either in Cash or by Post
                        Office Order; but when necessary, Bankers will not generally object to
                        them.</p>
                    <p>A halfpenny is never mentioned in a Cheque; no sum less than a penny.</p>
                    <p>A Cheque on a Banker is merely an order on the Banker to pay money to
                            <emph>A.B.</emph> or Bearer, or to <emph>A.B.</emph> or Order. It is
                        usually written lengthways on a half sheet of note‐paper, when a printed

                        back of it. Therefore, whenever you send a Cheque by Post, or Messenger,
                        write it “or Order,” and not “or Bearer;” this shields you from any fraud
                        except direct forgery. Indeed, you will find it a safe precaution to make
                        all your Cheques payable “to Order,” as you will hereby retain evidence of
                        the payment having been made, even if you lose your receipt.</p>

                    <p>Then, not only must Mr. — first “endorse it” by signing his name on the back,
                        if it be an Order, but it will not then be paid by your Banker, unless it is
                        presented for payment by some other Banker, or to a known customer; and for
                        this reason, never cross a Cheque intended to be presented for payment at
                        your own Bank, by the person in whose favour it is drawn. If a dishonest
                        person stole the letter, and forged Mr. —’s name, he could not get the
                        Cheque cashed, unless he happened to be in such good circumstances as to
                        have an account of his own with a Banker. This reduces the risk of fraud
                        very considerably. If instead of writing “<term>and Company</term>” or only
                            “<term>&amp; Co.</term>” you write the name of Mr. —’s banker, the
                            chance<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7187-040"></pb> of fraud is still further
                        reduced. Always adopt this or the last preceding form when you cannot obtain
                        a receipt <emph>at the moment of writing the Cheque</emph>.</p>
                    <p><term>Dating Cheques in advance of the day.</term>—Never let a Cheque bear
                        the date of a day after that on which you issue it. The penalty is £100 to
                        the “<term>Drawer</term>” of the Cheque, as well as to the Banker who pays
                        it knowingly. Any person taking it (knowingly) is liable to a penalty of
                        £20.</p>
                    <p>The “<term>Drawer</term>” is the person who signs the Cheque.</p>
                    <p><term>Cheque, after a person’s death.</term>—A Banker must not pay a Cheque
                        if he is aware the Drawer is dead. He is quite justified in paying the
                        Cheque if he is ignorant of the fact. Also, a Cheque is invalid after the
                        Drawer is a Bankrupt.</p>
                    <p><term>Cheque, when presented for payment.</term>—A Cheque<pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7187-041"></pb> should be presented for payment as soon as
                        possible after it has been received, as in the event of any undue delay and
                        failure of the Bank, the holder will have no claim on the drawer.</p>
                    <p><term>Cheque, if dishonoured.</term>—The Banker writes on it “No effects,” or
                        “Refer to Drawer,” or he gives some other reason for not paying it.</p>
                    <p><term>Writing distinctly.</term>—Be careful in drawing a Cheque for eight
                        pounds that the “<emph>t</emph>” at the end of the word “<emph>Eight</emph>”
                        should join on the “<emph>P</emph>” of the word “<emph>Pounds</emph>.” I
                        believe no sum is so easily altered in a Cheque, if it should fall into the
                        hands of a dishonest person. By simply adding a “<emph>y</emph>” it makes
                            “<emph>Eight</emph>” “<emph>Eighty</emph>.” The dots should be put very
                        close to the figure 8 to prevent an 0 being added there. Also, it is
                        advisable not to allow room for a dishonest person to add anything
                            <emph>before</emph> the sum written down. Thus, if your Cheque is for
                        £60, you must not leave space enough to add “<emph>Two Hundred</emph>”
                        before the<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7187-042"></pb> “<emph>Sixty</emph>.” Another
                        safeguard is as follows:—suppose your Cheque is for £82 15<choice>

                    <p><term>Stamp.</term>—All Cheques must have a Draft or Receipt (not a Postage
                        Stamp) adhesive or impressed; also all Drafts or Orders for payment of money
                        to Bearer on demand. When you write a Cheque on a piece of note‐paper you
                        must affix a Stamp, and cancel it by writing on it your name or initials.
                        Each penny Stamp affixed to Cheques or Orders must be cancelled by writing
                        your name across it, or your initials upon it. There are also Stamps which
                        are required by law to be affixed to Foreign Bills of Exchange, when
                        negotiated in England, and when these Stamps are used, they must be
                        cancelled by writing your name across, adding also the date.</p>
                    <p><term>Printed Cheque‐book.</term>—Ask your Banker for a Cheque‐book ready
                        stamped; it saves trouble.<pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7187-043"></pb> You will have to
                        pay a penny for each Stamp: the most usual number is three dozen, which will

                        you, and you intend paying the Cheque to him yourself, the crossing need not
                        be made.</p>

                    <p><term>Cheques for Money lent.</term>—If a friend borrows money from you, and
                        afterwards repays you with a Cheque, you will naturally send it to your
                        Banker to be cashed; but unless you give special instructions to the
                        contrary, he will enter it on the <term>Credit</term> side of your
                        Pass‐book, where its appearance will swell the amount of your receipts, may
                        embarrass your accounts, and make your income appear larger than it really
                        is. To avoid this, tell your Banker “<emph>not to pass it through your
                            account</emph>,” but simply “<emph>to get it cashed for you</emph>,” or,
                        in other words, “<emph>To give cash for it, instead of placing it to your
                            credit</emph>.”</p>
                    <p><term>Never destroy a Cheque.</term>—If a Cheque is given you, and you do not
                        wish to use it, tear off and destroy the <term>signature</term>, then
                        enclose the Cheque (which, having no signature, is useless) to the person
                        who drew it.</p>

                    <head>LETTERS OF CREDIT AND CIRCULAR NOTES.</head>
                    <p><term>When a person is going to travel</term> on the Continent he usually
                        takes with him a Letter of Credit, or Circular Letters, generally both. In
                        order to obtain the former, he deposits with his Banker the sum he wishes to
                        have entered in his Letter of Credit, and names the towns where he may
                        probably wish to draw money.</p>
                    <p>Suppose Mr. A— is going to Rome, and thinks he may possibly want £500, and
                        may wish to draw money in Paris, Basle, Florence, Rome, and Frankfort. He
                        writes to his London Banker (or else asks his Country Banker to write to
                        their London Banker) to send him a Letter of Credit for £500 upon those
                        places. Should he mention to him five towns, he must sign his name on five
                        different slips of foreign or thin paper, and enclose them at the same time.
                        If he mentions eight towns, then eight slips of paper must be sent, one for
                        each place mentioned.</p>
                    <pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7187-056"></pb>
                    <p>The London Banker writes to each of the towns specified, and encloses Mr.
                        A—’s signature. Mr. A— will see that those particular towns are mentioned in
                        his Letter of Credit, and what Bankers he can go to; also the full sum he
                        may draw for. If Mr. A— finds he wants £50 in Paris, he refers to his Letter
                        of Credit and takes it to the Banker mentioned, and asks for that sum in the
                        coin of the country. He is requested to sign his name, and if the signature
                        is like that on the slip of paper sent from Mr. A—’s London Banker, the
                        money is immediately paid to him, and the Banker inserts in the Letter of
                        Credit how much Mr. A— has received from him, which enables other Bankers to
                        see how much remains of the £500 when he asks for more money.</p>
                    <p>On Mr. A—’s return to England, he send the Letter of Credit to his Banker,
                        that he may know how much has been drawn.</p>
                    <p>A Letter of Credit is worded much in this way:—</p>

                        pounds and upwards, can be obtained from many London Bankers, and the
                        intending traveller’s own Banker will them for him.<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7187-058"></pb> They have this advantage over a Letter of Credit;
                        the traveller can receive his money at many different places, instead of one
                        or two fixed towns, and even innkeepers will frequently cash them.</p>
                    <p>“The traveller, having determined how much money he will require for his
                        journey, pays in that sum to the Banker, and receives in exchange, without
                        any charge except the Stamp duty, notes to the same amount, each of the
                        value of £10 or upwards, together with a general <term>letter</term> or
                            <term>order</term>, addressed by the House to its foreign agents, which
                        serves to identify the bearer. The letter is addressed to nearly two hundred
                        agents and correspondents in different parts of Europe, so that whatever the
                        traveller may be, he cannot be very far removed from his supplies.</p>
                    <p>“The value of the Notes is reduced into Foreign money, at the current usance
                        of exchange on London, at the time and place of payment, subject to no
                        deduction for <term>Commission</term>, or to any other charge whatever,
                        unless the payment be required in some particular coin which bears a<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7187-059"></pb> premium. They are drawn to Order, and the
                        traveller will naturally, for his own security, not indorse them till he
                        receives the money; besides which, such checks are so concerted with the
                        agents as to render a successful forgery of his name scarcely possible.” See

                        sight, which require endorsement before they can be paid, and are therefore
                        safe to send by post. Country Bankers also issue Bank Post Bills at various
                        dates, not exceeding 21 days’ date, but Cheques made payable to Order, are
                        generally sufficient for the purpose of remittance.</p>

                        careful to adhere strictly to this form, and not to add more words, for if a
                        person goes on to state when it will be paid,—for instance, “I.O.U. £200, to
                        be paid on July the 10th, 1863,”—the latter words amount to a promise to pay
                        upon a particular day, and the paper must be stamped, as being a Promissory
                        Note or an Agreement. It is better to take a Promissory Note when you can
                        get it, as being more regular than an I.O.U.</p>

                    <p><term>Dividends</term> are the half‐yearly payments of Interest, on the
                        different Government Shares and Stock. They are paid regularly, but
                        generally three or four days after they become due. The transfer books are
                        shut four or five weeks previous to the day on which the dividends become
                        due, for the calculation of interest.</p>
                    <p>You cannot receive your dividends at the Bank of England unless you go in
                        person. If therefore you cannot go yourself, you obtain and sign a Power of
                        Attorney for your Banker, or any one you can trust, to enable him to receive
                        the dividends for you. After the first purchase, no new Power of Attorney or
                        Letter of Attorneys for <emph>dividends</emph> is requisite.</p>
                    <p>When you purchase Government Stock, a receipt is signed by a clerk in the
                        Transfer Office at the Bank of England, and countersigned by your broker,
                        and is termed a “Stock Receipt.” <emph>This will be sent to you.</emph> When
                        you buy Stock, you must keep the Seller’s receipt, at least until you have
                        received one dividend upon it; it is then<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7187-066"></pb>
                        of less consequence, as the receipt of a dividend shows that the Stock now
                        belongs to you.</p>
                    <p><term>Power of Attorney</term>, or <term>Letter of Attorney</term>, is a
                        stamped letter (if the sum to be received is above £3), to allow one Person
                        on behalf of another to sell, transfer, or deliver Stock of any kind, or to
                        receive dividends.</p>
                    <p>To obtain a Power of Attorney, write to your Banker, who will procure and
                        send it to you. You must sign the document with your name <emph>in
                            full</emph>, or the usual way in which you write your signature, and
                        there must be two witnesses to your signature. These also must sign their
                        names in full, or their usual signatures, and add the places of their abode,
                        quality, or occupation. No person under age can be a witness, nor can the

                        authorities prefer purchasers doing this personally, as it prevents
                        fraud.</p>
                    <p><term>Signature and Formalities.</term>—In selling Government Stock, write
                        down legibly for your Broker, your name, address, and quality, exactly in
                        the same way as it was entered in the Bank books when you bought the Stock.
                        Your must refer to the same address as, “late of —, —,” if you have removed
                        elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>The Broker will undertake to see that the Transfer is all right. He will give
                        you a plain account of how much Stock he has sold, and<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7187-071"></pb> what you have to receive. You can then go with
                        the Broker to the Transfer Office, to transfer that amount to the purchaser.
                        It is the Broker’s duty to see that all is done properly; and, if necessary,
                        to identify you as having been the possessor of that amount of Stock.</p>
                    <p><term>A Trustee</term> can transfer Stock to another Trustee or to the person
                        for whom he is Trustee, on his majority, without selling it.</p>
                    <p>In transferring Stock, Brokers charge ⅛ per Cent.</p>
                    <p><term>Advantages of investing in the Funds.</term>—The convenience of putting
                        money into the Funds is great, because small savings can be readily
                        invested. If you buy in at £80 you will get 3¾ per cent. on your money; if
                        at £86, 3½ per cent.; if at 92, 3¼ per cent.; and if at £100, 3 per cent. It
                        is advisable to keep your papers secure and unseen by improper persons, to
                        prevent them or their accomplices from applying in your name.</p>

                    <p><term>Certificates, payable to Bearer.</term>—An Act has been lately passed,
                        authorizing Stock to change their present title into Certificates,
                            <term>payable to Bearer</term>. The transfer of these Certificates will
                        require no Broker, and no formality. They will pass from hand to hand as
                        simply as a Bank‐note. Coupons are to be attached to each Certificate for
                        the obtaining of Dividends. The Certificates are to be for £50, and
                        multiples of that sum. Experience only will show the merits and demerits of
                        this newly‐proposed scheme. The Act refers only to 3 per Cent Consols,
                        Reduced 3 per Cent, and the New 3 per Cent.</p>

                        to sell Stock, in order to obtain the money you wish to lend, make an

                        sometimes above, but more frequently below £100; if above, it is called
                            <term>above par</term>; if below, <term>below par.</term></p>
                    <p>Rule to ascertain the value of Stocks or Shares: Multiply by the price per

                    <p><term>Exchequer Bills</term> are Loans to Government for twelve months. They
                        are issued annually, at which time the rate of interest is fixed. They are
                        generally for sums of £100, £200, £500, and £1,000. They have the advantage
                        of being easily converted into money at any time, and of bearing interest up
                        to the day they were either bought or sold. Government generally calls in
                        the Bills at the end of the year (due notice is always given), when the
                        holder has the option of receiving either a new Bill or his £100 with
                        interest. Holders must not neglect to present the Bills on the day
                        appointed, either themselves or through their<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7187-077"></pb> Banker, otherwise they will be deprived of the interest till the next

                        Return them to him as soon as you can, that he may have them registered at
                        the Railway Company’s Office. When this is done, the Broker will supply you
                        with vouchers, in proof of the Shares having been so registered in your
                        name. Most of the Railway Companies now arrange that their Shares shall
                        represent Stock (a certain number of Shares to £100 Stock). In this case,
                        one document only is necessary for the whole amount.</p>

                    <p><term>Debenture Bonds, especially Railway Bonds</term>, are generally issued
                        for an agreed period, which terminates usually in three, five, or seven
                        years, at a fixed rate of interest. It is a convenient kind of investment.
                        The holder of the Bond has generally the option of renewing it, on the same
                        or other agreed terms. The Secretary of the Company will always write to you
                        some weeks before the Bond becomes due, asking whether you will renew on
                        certain terms stated in his letter, or whether you desire to have it paid.
                        If you are willing to renew it at the expiration of the term (even though it
                        may bear a different rate of interest) no new stamp will be required. To the
                        Debenture Bond are attached Coupons, or Interest Warrants, which are
                        generally small pieces of paper a few inches in length: one has<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7187-082"></pb> to be cut off every half‐year and sent to your
                        Bankers, and sign your name at the back. Some Companies require a Draft or
                        Receipt Stamp on the back of the Coupon, and some do not. This will be
                        arranged for you by your Banker. Write a note to your Bankers at the same
                        time (unless you take it yourself). They will procure from their London
                        Bankers the sum marked on the Coupon, after deducting the Income‐tax.</p>

                    <head>SHARES.</head>
                    <p><hi>WHEN</hi> a new undertaking, such as a Canal, Railway, Gas, Water‐works,
                        &amp;c., is about to be commenced, the first thing is to raise money or
                        Capital to meet it, which is generally done by offering Shares to the
                        Public, say of £100 or £50 each. If £1,000 is wanted, the Company may offer
                        ten Shares at £100 each, or twenty Shares at £50 each.</p>
                    <p>At the end of each year, the sum which has been received (if a Canal or
                        Railway, from the traffic on it), after paying all necessary expenses of
                        management, keeping in repair, &amp;c., is divided equally among the Shares.
                        Suppose £500 is<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7187-088"></pb> cleared at the end of one
                        year, and there are one hundred Shares, that Dividend would be £5 on each
                        Share. If the Company had much traffic, it might clear £6, £7, or £8 on each
                        Share.</p>
                    <p>As the traffic is not always the same, so the Dividends are not always the
                        same, but vary; and should a second Canal or Railway be made, more
                        convenient to the Public, it would, of course, materially reduce the
                        traffic, and consequently the Dividend, of the first; and that would lower
                        the value of the Shares. This is the reason why Shares are less safe than
                        Bonds, Loans, &amp;c. which do not vary in their value.</p>
                    <p>The Shares are sometimes turned into <term>Stock</term>, which has this
                        convenience:—You may buy any quantity, large or small, but you could not
                        have bought a <emph>part</emph> of a Share.</p>
                    <p><term>Premium.</term>—If the Share‐property is prosperous and the Dividends
                        are good, the price of them will be regulated accordingly, and purchasers
                        will give more than £100 for £100 of Stock—say<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7187-089"></pb> £102; this is called being at 2 premium. If the
                        market price was exactly £100, they would be “<term>at par.</term>”</p>
                    <p><term>Discount.</term>—On the other hand, the Share‐property may not pay a
                        good Dividend, owing to the want of traffic, or want of confidence in the
                        management of it, or the fear of a rival competition. The Shareholders may
                        take fright, and wish to get out of the concern, and be willing to part with
                        their Shares for an amount under the £100—say £97; this is called being at
                        £3 discount.</p>
                    <p>Shares are influenced by many other causes than the above. Shareholders
                        should not therefore take fright, every time the Shares go down, and sell
                        out, but be advised by some competent man of business before selling out at
                        a loss.</p>
                    <p><term>Preference Shares.</term>—A Company sometimes wants to increase its
                        Capital. Perhaps the Rail‐<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7187-090"></pb> way or Canal
                        requires lengthening, to reach some other town, and wants money for the
                        purpose. One plan is to create <term>Preference Shares</term>; thus, the
                        Company may fix—viz. £10, or £20, or £50 Shares, and those <emph>they</emph>
                        do not take are then offered to the Public. The Dividend upon these Shares
                        is fixed, say 4½ or 5 per cent., and is paid in preference, <choice>
                            <abbr>i.e.</abbr>
                            <expan>id est</expan>
                        </choice> before the ordinary Shareholders receive Dividend upon the
                        original Stock.</p>
                    <p>The advantage of these Preference Shares is, that even if the concern should
                        not be flourishing, still the Dividend on them will be paid, as long as the
                        net annual income is sufficient, even if there is nothing left to pay
                        anything to the ordinary Shareholders.</p>
                    <p><term>New Shares and Calls.</term>—Another way adopted by a Company to
                        increase its Capital is by creating new Shares. The Company, having an
                        increasing traffic, wants increasing Capital. It<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7187-091"></pb> offers to cash Shareholder as many new as he
                        original Shares, or in such proportion as the Company may choose to offer
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Suppose you have two old Shares, it offers you two new ones of £20 each; on
                        which it “makes a Call” of £2 a year, or at such intervals as it wants
                        money, till the £20 is all paid up. You pay the £4 when called for, and for
                        that you are paid at the same rate of Dividend as on the old Shares, unless
                        otherwise agreed upon. Should the Company be remarkably prosperous, you may
                        sometimes sell them immediately, at a good premium: there are cases when you
                        may sell the Share on which you have paid only £2 for £5, viz. £3 premium.
                        You should always accept these promising Shares when offered, if you hear
                        they can be sold at a premium, because you may sell them and make money, or
                        you can keep them yourself, and pay the Calls when they arise. These Calls
                        are useful, to those who save money, as a mode of investment for small sums,
                        both because they bring a better percentage than<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7187-092"></pb> Shares, on which all the Calls have been paid,
                        and because no expense attends the investment.</p>

                    <head>LOANS.</head>
                    <p>Another way which Companies have of raising money is by Loans on Debenture
                        Bonds. They want perhaps a large sum at once, to make some great
                        improvement, which they hope by degrees to pay back. They then offer to
                        receive Loans from anybody, for a certain term of years, paying a certain
                        interest, which varies according to the then state of the Money Market,
                        perhaps 3¾ or 4 per cent., which careful people are glad to accept, because
                        of the safety of their principal.</p>
                    <p>The more unsafe the concern, the higher the interest it offers, in hopes of
                        catching the reckless and unwary; but an inexperienced person should
                        consider, that if money can be borrowed by safe concerns for 4 per cert. no
                        one would offer 5 or more, unless they knew their credit was not good. This
                        high interest is often paid out of the capital,<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7187-093"></pb> as long as it lasts, and when that is gone the
                        whole concern comes to an end, and the lender may be ruined. Where the
                        concern is good, and the interest fair, a Loan on Debenture Bond is one of
                        the safest ways of investing money; as at the end of the term you have the
                        whole of your money back, and the interest on Loans is paid before
                        Preference Shares or any Shares.</p>

                    <head>MORTGAGE.</head>
                    <p>A person wants, perhaps, to raise a sum of money. He does not like to sell
                        his land, therefore he offers a Mortgage upon it. Say he wants £1,000. You,
                        wanting to invest that sum, lend it to him, at the interest of the day—say 4
                        per cent.; and he gives you as security the Deeds of his Estate, which
                        should be to the value of £1,500 at the least, so that, if he fails to pay
                        you back your £1,000 at the time fixed, you can sell his Estate, and, after
                        paying all the expenses of<pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7187-094"></pb> the sale, find a
                        sufficient surplus to insure the repayment of what you lent.</p>
                    <p>A <emph>good</emph> Mortgage is an excellent investment, like the Loans; but
                        much care is necessary, and your <emph>own</emph> Attorney should always
                        carry out the transaction, and should ascertain that there has not been a
                        previous Mortgage raised upon the Estate, and that the person may be
                        depended upon for paying the interest regularly, as you would naturally
                        hesitate before having recourse to legal measures to obtain it. Here, as in
                        Loans, where a higher percentage is offered than is given by the Money
                        Market, you may be sure that there is some difficulty in borrowing, owing to
                        the credit or security not being good, as no man will offer more interest
                        than he is obliged. The Borrower always pays his own expenses, the expenses
                        of the Lender, and the Lender’s Attorney.</p>
                    <p>Buildings, and especially trade buildings, are much less satisfactory
                        securities than land.</p>
                    <p>Lending money on Mortgage requires great<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7187-095"></pb>
                        caution as to the character of the person borrowing. Unsuspecting persons
                        have often been victimised when all has previously appeared properly
                        done.</p>
                    <p>Suppose Lady A. lends money to Mr. B., on the understanding that the whole
                        money is to be repaid, say at the end of seven years, and that 4 per cent.
                        interest is to be paid Lady A. each year. Now suppose B. neglects to pay
                        interest. Lady A. wants her money; but, too late, she finds that she cannot
                        make a <term>legal title</term> to sell B.’s land. This may go on for years,
                        till poor Lady A. is only too happy to sacrifice all interest due to her, so
                        that she may get her principal again, which is just the fraud this Mr. B.
                        has meditated upon all along.</p>
                    <p>It may be suggested that the Lawyers should see to this. But, in practice, it
                        often happens to Ladies to be quite indignant at the suggestion of their
                        Lawyer, as to the substantial character of Mr. B., who may be a personal
                        friend or a connexion of a deceased husband, and has attracted her
                        partisanship by means of a persuasive tongue.</p>

                    <p>A Mortgage should always contain a power for the Lender to sell in the event

                        the gentleman’s, which are placed in the hands of trustees, to secure a

                        death or bankruptcy. No prudent woman should marry without this provision,
                        as, if it is made before her marriage, however much in debt her husband may
                        become, from extravagance, or misfortune, her settlement money cannot be
                        made liable.</p>

                        entrusted to them, if any is lost through their gross carelessness, and they
                        are liable to make it good. Any one accepting this Office should thoroughly
                        understand what he undertakes, and never act without the advice of a lawyer,
                        particularly when asked to give consent to a change of investment. He should
                        never, <emph>on any account whatever</emph>, consent to any investment not
                        authorized by the Will or Settlement. He must also recollect that, though
                        entitled to be repaid all reasonable expenses incurred in his Trusteeship,
                        or in taking advice, &amp;c. he can never make any profit by his Office. A
                        Trustee, or his co‐Trustee, should have the Marriage Settlement and all

                        his hands or in those of a lawyer, and never leave them in the husband’s
                        keeping. When so much responsibility is entailed with it, it is but fair
                        that, on accepting the office, a Trustee should be made <emph>fully</emph>
                        cognisant of what he undertakes, and what his duties are, and as little
                        trouble should be given him as<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7187-107"></pb> possible.
                        He should be put to no expense of postage or otherwise. When sending him
                        papers, &amp;c. to sign, enclose the right number of postage‐stamps on a
                        proper‐sized envelope, addressed to yourself, so that he has nothing to do,
                        after signing, but to re‐inclose the papers and send them. A Trustee’s
                        office is a burthensome and usually a thankless one, but it is a duty to
                        accept it when appealed to by a near relation.</p>

                    <head>WILLS.</head>
                    <p>The following instructions should be strictly followed in executing a Will.
                            <emph>First</emph>, never make one if you can possibly help it, without
                        the aid of a lawyer. <emph>Secondly</emph>, if there be none to be had, and
                        the case is urgent, the following regulations must be attended to—</p>
                    <p>1st. The date should be inserted.</p>
                    <p>2d. You must then, in the presence of <emph>two</emph> witnesses, sign the
                        Will on each sheet of the Will (if it is written on more sheets than one),
                        at the<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7187-108"></pb> bottom of the writing, and say, in
                        the presence and hearing of the witnesses, “I publish and declare this to be
                        my last Will and Testament.”</p>
                    <p>3d. The witnesses should then sign their names and add their addresses and
                        qualities at the end of an attestation clause, which may be in the form
                        following, viz.: “Signed by the Testator as his Will, in the presence of us
                        present at the same time, who at his request, in his presence and in the
                        presence of each other, have subscribed our names as witnesses.” This must
                        be done <emph>at one time</emph>, and you and the two Witnesses <emph>must
                            continue together</emph> until every signature is completed. The
                        witnesses must not be the husband or wife of the Testator or Testatrix, or
                        interested in any way (directly or indirectly) under the Will.</p>
                    <p><term>Executor to a Will</term> is a person appointed to carry out the
                        instructions in the Will.</p>
                    <p><term>In making a Will</term>, be careful to appoint two or more Executors,
                        for if no Executor is appointed,<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7187-109"></pb> your
                        friends have to apply for Letters of Administration before they can execute
                        the Will. This is expensive, and must be paid out of your estate. If one of
                        your Executors should die in your life‐time, immediately appoint another. If
                        time admits, always get the promise of your friend to act as Executor before
                        appointing him.</p>
                    <p><term>Intestate.</term>—That is, leaving no Will at your death. In this case,
                        also an Administration becomes necessary, and the Government duty and other
                        expenses are materially increased, to the loss of your family.</p>
                    <p><term>Letters of Administration</term> will be granted on application to the
                        District Registrar of the Probate Court within which the deceased was
                        resident at his death.</p>
                    <p><term>Make a Will</term> as soon as you have any property to dispose of. Make
                        a point of reading it over once a year on a stated day—say your birthday.<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7187-110"></pb> Circumstances are constantly changing
                        which require a corresponding change in your Will. Much injustice may be
                        avoided by attending to this rule. Marriage operates as a revocation of a
                        Will previously made, so if you marry, bear this in mind, and write another
                        as soon as you can.</p>

                    <head>AGENTS’ CHARGES.</head>
                    <p>In all special matters of business in which you have to employ a third
                        person, such as an Agent, Broker, Commissioner, &amp;c. an inexperienced
                        person should ascertain before employing him what his charges are. It saves
                        annoyance on both sides when the agent’s bill comes in, and prevents an
                        overcharge being made, which it is difficult and disagreeable to settle
                        satisfactorily afterwards. There is certainly the resource of the County
                        Court, but it is not every one, especially when a lady, who likes to appear
                        there to give evidence. Even if they do so, ladies have small chances in<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7187-111"></pb> their favour, under a severe and
                        ungenerous cross‐examination.</p>
                    <p><term>Servants’ Characters.</term>—Some people keep a small book, in which
                        they enter the Servant’s name, age, and qualification; where he lived last,
                        and when he entered their service, &amp;c. On the following pages, they
                        write the receipt for him to sign. This is very convenient, as it is easy of
                        reference when you are asked the character of a Servant. The character of a
                        Servant should be carefully kept; if a good one, it may be of great
                        consequence to him, as many employers object to give the same person a
                        character twice.</p>
                    <p><term>Servants’ Wages, &amp;c.</term>—Much may be done by a little method,
                        such as paying Servants their wages at stated times. Quarterly is generally
                        preferred; for instance, if a Servant enters your employment in February,
                        pay him or her up to the quarter at Lady Day, finding out by a wage table
                        (which is in the <bibl><title>Ready Reckoner</title></bibl>, and also in

                        continue to pay at the usual quarters.</p>
                    <p>Each Servant should give a receipt with a stamp, if above £2, and sign a

                    <p><term>Income Tax</term> is frequently altered by Act of Parliament: the
                        change generally takes place on April 5th. If charged for Income Tax when
                        you are not liable for any, write to the Surveyor of Taxes thus:—“This whole
                        of my income is derived from sources from which the Property Tax is deducted
                        previous to the several amounts of which it consists being remitted to me.”
                        No person whose income is less than £100 a‐year is liable to pay Income Tax,
                        and any one who has an income exceeding £100, but less than £200 a‐year, is

                        originally lent is called the <term>Principal</term>, and the

                    <item><term>Interest, Simple and Compound.</term>—If you lend money for a term
                        of years, with the intention of receiving your interest, not year by year,
                        but in a round sum at the end of the term, there are two<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7187-124"></pb> very different ways of reckoning what you will
                        get. To explain, by an explain:—If the loan be for £100 for 10 years, at 4
                        per cent., the accumulated proceeds at “simple interest” would be simply 10
                        times £4, or £40. But if you reckoned by “compound interest,” you would
                        receive more. The yearly incomings of £4 might have been invested as soon as
                        they were due, and would have borne additional interest. The first £4 would
                        have been invested for 9 years, and the second £4 for 8 years, and so on.
                        Besides this, the interest of these last sums, small as it is, might have
                        been invested. The amount of compound interest, for any term of years, can
                        be readily calculated by arithmeticians. In the above case it would be about
                        £47, but in 100 years, when the simple interest would have amounted to only
                        £400, compound interest would have become no less than £4,950. A sum placed
                        at compound interest, at 3 per cent., doubles itself in 24 years; at 3½ per
                        cent., in 21 years; at 4 per cent. in 18 years (fractions being excluded):
                            hence<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7187-125"></pb> the accumulations by compound
                        interest become enormous in long terms.</item>

                        <p>In the last case it means that C.D. &amp; Co. place £100 to the credit of
                            A.B., paid in by or for A.B., and on the other side they place to the
                            debit of A.B. £50 drawn out by Cheque, payable to self or some other
                            party; showing that £50 in their books, of which the pass‐book purports
                            to be an exact copy, stands to the credit of A.B. The result is, of
