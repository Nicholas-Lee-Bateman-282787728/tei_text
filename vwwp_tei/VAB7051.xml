                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag,
                    with the value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All
                    split lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for
                    the final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as
                    &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>

                        <l>And thinks âthe part is good and well conceived</l>

                        <l>No, but a man who feels his heart asleep,</l>
                        <l>As he might feel his hand or foot. The limb</l>

                        <l>And I may say and not be overâbold,</l>

                        <pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7051-030"/>
                        <l>And did not conquerâOh the agony</l>
                        <l>Even to dream of that first shamed defeat!â</l>
                        <l>And then the dream was shifted: I was thronged</l>
                        <l>By furious enemies before the gate</l>
                        <l>Of Compiegne, and taken prisoner!</l>
                        <l>They were haling me along, and still I strove,</l>
                        <l>And strove, and strove. And all the while it seemed</l>
                        <l>As if by an awful prescience I knew</l>
                        <l>My waiting death, more dreadful than to lie</l>
                        <l>Shattered and gashed beneath the onward rush</l>
                        <l>Of the frantic horses spurred into our ranks,</l>
                        <l>And die amid the roar of English shoutsâ</l>
                        <l>Meseemed my living limbs were to be given</l>
                        <l>To scorch and writhe and shrivel in the fireâ</l>
                        <l>I was to know like torment and like shame</l>
                        <l>With those who front our God with blasphemies</l>
                        <l>And loathsome magicâAh! my head swims round</l>
                        <l>Still dizzy with the terror of my dream.</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">But you are come, you gracious messengers,</l>

                            <l>And therefore tainted with earthâs curse of sin?</l>
                            <l>Did Mary envy Martha? Oh my Lord</l>
                            <l>Forgive thy handmaid if her spirit lone,</l>

                            <l>With the poor human want of human love,</l>

                            <l>Though doubtless Satan does not track so close</l>
                            <l>Until he fears one. But they are less armed:</l>
                            <l>Alas how he may break them! Poor weak souls,</l>

                            <l>The loves and hopes and faiths, the very life</l>

                            <l>For then the present bitterness of death,</l>

                            <l>Where I was sitting by the broken well,</l>
                            <l>Looking at the green growth that overslimed</l>

                            <l>And under all, chill, chill!â âGod bless you daughter,â</l>
                            <l>She said; her usual greeting, but it came</l>

                            <l>A little trivial phrase in the right tone</l>
                            <l>Makes music for so long. âGod bless you daughterâ</l>

                            <l>From the lives of the saints, and wise encouragements;</l>
                            <l>And I wept on. But the warm touch of her hands</l>
                            <l>Nursing my right hand in them motherly,</l>
                            <l>And the feeling of her kindly neighbourhood,</l>
                            <l>These spoke a language that I understood</l>
                            <l>And thrilled to in my desolate mood. Through them</l>
                            <l>That heavy sense of prison loneliness,</l>
                            <l>Whether I moved alone or companied,</l>
                            <l>Was lifted from my heart, broken away</l>
                            <l>In the rushing of my tears; and even from then,</l>
                            <l>Wherefore I know not, I was moved to grope</l>
                            <l>Up from the dark towards the light of Heaven.</l>
                            <l rend="ti-1">But ah the long ascent! It was enough</l>
                            <l>At first to learn the patience that subdued</l>
                            <l>My throbbing heart to its new quiet rule,</l>
                            <l>The hope of Heaven that bore down earthâs despairâ</l>

                            <l>But these were comfort, and the craving grew</l>
                            <l>As natural for them as the sick manâs</l>
                            <l>For the painâsoothing draught he learned perforce</l>
                            <l>To school his palate to. But then the effort</l>
                            <l>To be another self, to know no more</l>
                            <l>The fineâlinked dreams of youth, the flying thoughts</l>
                            <l>Like sparkles on the waveâtops changing place</l>
                            <l>And all one scattered brightness, the high schemes</l>
                            <l>And glorious wild endeavours after good,</l>
                            <l>Fond, bubbleâsoaring, but how beautiful!</l>
                            <l>The sweet unreal reveries, the gush</l>
                            <l>Of voiceless songs deep in the swelling heart,</l>
                            <l>The dear delight of happy girlish hopesâ</l>
                            <l>Of, ah my folly! some hopes too strange sweet</l>
                            <l>That I dare think of them even to rebukeâ</l>
                            <l>Ah not to be forgotten though they lie</l>
                            <l>Too deep for even memory. Alas!</l>
                            <l>Even if I would, how could I now recall</l>
                            <l>To their longâfaded forms those phantasies</l>
                            <l>Of a far, other, consciousness which now</l>
                            <l>Beneath the ashes of their former selves</l>
                            <l>Lie a dead part of me, but still a part,</l>
                            <l>Oh evermore a part.</l>
                            <pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7051-048"/>
                            <l>I do not think</l>
                            <l>There can be sin in that, in knowing it.</l>
                            <l>I am not nursing the old foolish love</l>
                            <l>Which clogged my spirit in those bitter days.</l>
                            <l>Ah no, dear as it was even in its pain,</l>
                            <l>I have trampled on it, crushed its last life out.</l>
                            <l>I do not dread the beautiful serpent now;</l>
                            <l>It cannot breathe again, not if I tried</l>
                            <l>To warm it at my breast, it is too dead</l>
                            <l>And my heart has grown too cold; the Lord himself,</l>
                            <l>I thank Him, has renewed it virginâcold</l>
                            <l>To give to Him. I do but recognize</l>
                            <l>A simple truth, that that which has been lived,</l>
                            <l>Lived down to the deeps of the true being, <emph rend="i">is</emph></l>
                            <l>Even when past for ever, has become</l>
                            <l>Inseparable from the lifelong self:</l>
                            <l>But yet it lives not with the <emph rend="i">present</emph> life.</l>
                            <l>So, in this wise, I may unshamed perceive</l>
                            <l>That the dead life, that the dead love, are still</l>
                            <l>A part of me</l>
                            <l>Nay do I fool myself?</l>
                            <l>Why do I fever so thinking of him?</l>
                            <l>Why do I think of him? What brought his face</l>

                            <l>So vividly before me? Angelo,</l>
                            <l>Art thou in the nightâstillness waking now</l>
                            <l>Remembering me, remembering me who came</l>
                            <l>A little moment into thy bright life</l>
                            <l>And seemed to make it brighter, and then passed,</l>
                            <l>Leaving no doubt a little cloud behind,</l>
                            <l>Till when? Till now? Till death comes with the end?</l>
                            <l>Or till the otherâs smile had lighted it</l>
                            <l>With the rich rose of dawn to brighter day?</l>
                            <l>While she lies dreaming of the dainty dress</l>
                            <l>Ordered for next nightâs ball, art thou indeed</l>
                            <l>Thinking, alone in heart, of former days,</l>
                            <l>And asking the dull hush to speak of me?</l>
                            <l>Or is it but a careless memory</l>
                            <l>Passing thy dreamy thought a moment long,</l>
                            <l>A wondering lightly âIs she reconciled</l>
                            <l>To the lot they gave her?â But, whateâer it be,</l>
                            <l>Surely some thought of shine came to me now</l>
                            <l>And called mine to thee.</l>
                            <l>Nay, it must not be.</l>
                            <l>Oh once my own beloved, now a mere name,</l>

                            <l>Vex me no more with idle communings,â</l>

                            <l>I stand as far apart as angels are</l>
                            <l>From earthly passionânot by my own strength,</l>
                            <l>But by the grace shewn in me, and the bar</l>
                            <l>Of my divine espousal. Stand far off</l>
                            <l>Even in thought.</l>
                            <l>Yes, though this was thy word,</l>
                            <l>That long fond evening when we stole apart</l>
                            <l>Out of the music and the talking, when</l>
                            <l>We stood below the orangeâboughs abloom,</l>
                            <l>And the sweet night was silent, and the waves</l>
                            <l>Were rocking softly underneath the moon,</l>
                            <l>Asleep in the white calm, and we, alone,</l>
                            <l>Were whispering all our hearts each into each:</l>
                            <l>âEva, my Eva, darling of my life,</l>
                            <l>If they should part us still you are my all.</l>
                            <l>I will not love the other. She might bear</l>
                            <l>My name, gild with the purchase money for it</l>
                            <l>Our housesâ tarnished splendours, rear the heirs</l>
                            <l>Of its new greatness.âYou, you, only you,</l>
                            <l>In your cold prison, would be wife to me,</l>
                            <l>Wife of my soul. Are we not one, love, so?</l>
                            <pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7051-051"/>
                            <l>They could not beat down that; and I would live</l>
                            <l>In a secret world with you, so that in Heaven</l>
                            <l>I could claim you boldly, âthis was my own wifeâ</l>
                            <l>And all the angels know it true.â</l>
                            <l>Ah me!</l>
                            <l>How long that wild rapt promise hindered me</l>
                            <l>In my first struggles for the Saintsâ cold peace,</l>
                            <l>Because he spoke it in a certain toneâ</l>
                            <l>Sometimes he used itâthat had a strange power</l>
                            <l>To thrill me with strange pleasure through and through</l>
                            <l>And leave long after echoes still possessed</l>
                            <l>Of something more than most tones, even his,</l>
                            <l>And easier to recall at will; and these</l>
                            <l>Remained with me; I could not quite forego</l>
                            <l>Their dangerous sweetness. So the Tempter came</l>
                            <l>Saying always âHe too thinks of themâ and I</l>
                            <l>Would be so weak, so wicked, that I thought,</l>
                            <l>âI cannot try to be in perfectness</l>
                            <l>One of the Heavenly Brides, lest I succeed</l>
                            <l>And, standing whiteârobed with the virgin train</l>
                            <l>Who in the after kingdom follow Christ,</l>
                            <l>See him and know him and am lost to him,</l>

                            <l>No more my love for ever, now at length</l>

                            <l>I can say calmly: âThough this was thy word</l>
                            <l>I do not bid thee honour it.â It was</l>
                            <l>The dream of a mad moment, let it pass:</l>
                            <l>I would not hold thee to it if I could:</l>
                            <l>I scale a heavenward height, and if I shiver</l>
                            <l>A little, just a little, in the snows,</l>
                            <l>On the darker days, should I for this descend</l>
                            <l>Into the earthâbalmed valley and forego</l>
                            <l>The victories of my toiling steps, the crown</l>
                            <l>Of my long enterprize! No, though thy voice</l>
                            <l>Were thrice and thrice as eagerâsweet as when</l>
                            <l>Long since it said âbe mine in earthâ to say</l>
                            <l>âBe mine in heavenâ I could not wait for thee.</l>
                            <l>I go alone, wearing my spousal ring,</l>
                            <l>My bridal throne is ready.</l>
                            <l>But, although</l>
                            <l>I love thee now with only such a love</l>
                            <l>As a dead saint might love that looked from Heaven,</l>
                            <l>It is no sin that I should yearn for thee</l>

                            <l>That overglad the heart, its corn and oil,</l>
                            <l>For the barren mountainâsummit near Godâs stars,</l>

                            <l>Would be that God deceived one, would be truth</l>

                            <l>Guiltless of that great blame and did but think</l>
                            <l>To daunt me to submission by a dread</l>
                            <l>So horrible. âYes, yes, believe me, daughter,â</l>
                            <l>The good man always said, ââtis as I told you:</l>

                            <l>A way to scare you to your good, no more;</l>

                            <l>At a certain great alliance hinted yours</l>

                            <l>It fits with what his dullard Princelinessâ</l>
                            <l>When he deigned to think that I, although less fair</l>
                            <l>Than the sister he had bought, might please his moods</l>
                            <l>With a more apt variety and reward;</l>
                            <l>His condescending choice by more applause</l>
                            <l>For how his princess played her brilliant part,</l>
                            <l>And, nothing doubting my delight, with mouths</l>
                            <l>Of secrecy and eyes significant,</l>
                            <l>Blinking owl mystery, and âTrust to meâ</l>

                            <l>As if he had tried his way, âNo convent, no;</l>
                            <l>This queenly Eva must not hide from us;</l>
                            <l>She is to shine in the world. Let her but smile</l>

                            <l>And put a little hand in mine; I promise</l>
                            <l>That from that moment none shall frighten her</l>
                            <l>With the hateful veil.â And when indignantly</l>
                            <l>I turned on him âAnd the betrothal, sir,</l>

                            <l>To turn it daintily as a courtier should</l>
                            <l>To our mother and my uncle?â He laughed low.</l>
                            <l>âLeave it to me, child. They are my good friends,</l>
                            <l>And Leonora has a lovely face,</l>
                            <l>And, were she sister to my wife, might have</l>
                            <l>A pretty dower. Ask if theyâre content</l>
                            <l>When I have told them you are.â Add to that</l>

                            <l>A bugbear for my conscience, meant no more</l>

                            <l>So let that pass, it need not swell the score.</l>
                            <l>But other sins? the many, what of them?</l>
                            <l>No easy reckoning this. Too well I know</l>
                            <l>My youth was girlishâwayward, too well know</l>

                            <l>But how to say âIn this and this I sinnedâ</l>
                            <l>Here evil dashed the goodâthere all was evil,â</l>
                            <l>Seems as if, coming from a woodland path,</l>

                            <l>That was my illâplaced glory. Poor fond fool</l>

                            <l>And answer and hear answered: âTell me, love,</l>
                            <l>What made you love me first?â âPerhaps it was,</l>
                            <l>My own proud Eva, that same queenly pride</l>
                            <l>Which, jesting, I have blamed you for, that pride</l>
                            <l>Which keeps you noblerâlived than other women.â</l>
                            <l>âMy own proud Eva,â that was how he called me</l>

                            <l>Was ever beating to the pleasant rhythm,</l>
                            <l>And I loved my pride because he loved it in me.</l>
                            <l>Oh! many and many sullen selfâdespises</l>
                            <l>And frettings at myself and weary moods</l>

                            <l>What was I pondering</l>
                            <l>Before this drowsy languor stole my will?</l>
                            <l>Let me remember.</l>
                            <l>Yes the sins and follies</l>
                            <l>Of my vain youth. But I had almost doneâ</l>
                            <l>Or had I? Where was I in the blurred page</l>
                            <l>Whose halfâforgotten fragmentâfacts from days</l>
                            <l>That were no more all faults than all good deeds</l>
                            <l>I am bidden read in the dusk that time has made?</l>
                            <l>Ah me! how to bethink me? When there grows</l>
                            <l>The counterfeit of some large landscape known</l>
                            <l>In past familiar days upon that sense</l>
                            <l>Which seems an inward memory of the eyeâ</l>

                            <l>One looked upon it with the former sightâ</l>
                            <l>If one were bidden break the vivid whole</l>
                            <l>Into its several parts traced point by point,</l>

                            <l>The rocks that broke the smoothness of the lake,</l>
                            <l>Or the black fissures on the great snowâhills,</l>
                            <l>Or say the pools along the marshy wastes,</l>
                            <l>How the thoughtâpicture would become perplexed</l>
                            <l>Into a shifting puzzle, and the sight</l>
                            <l>Would ache that vainly tried to scan by units.</l>
                            <l>Even so it seems to me when I essay</l>
                            <l>To singly look upon the marring flaws</l>
                            <l>That foiled my youthâs best virtues, or on those</l>
                            <l>That of its evil made the blackest scars.</l>

                            <l>Were full of faults: but what were the faultsâ names?</l>
                            <l>I am forgetting what I seekâtheir names?</l>
                            <l>Why there was many a paltry selfishnessâ</l>
                            <l>Many no doubt, for I was often shamed</l>
                            <l>To be so much below the self I dreamedâ</l>

                            <l>And there were pettish quarrels, girlishâwise,</l>
                            <l>With one or other of the rest at home,</l>
                            <l>Oftenest with Leonora, though, I think,</l>

                            <l>My memory dearest of them; she alone</l>
                            <l>Remembers my old nameâday, comes to me,</l>
                            <l>As if it still were festival to me,</l>

                            <l>Does she guess,</l>
                            <l>I wonder, that I could have stolen her greatness?</l>
                            <l>Poor Leonora, would she have lost much?</l>
                            <l>Wifeâs sister to the prince instead of wife;</l>
                            <l>That dowry he designed her for amends,</l>

                            <l>I would I knew her happy now! She says</l>
                            <l>She is most happy: but she says she knows</l>

                            <l>The roses drooping on us, and, far spread</l>
                            <l>On the clear water, greenness of the trees.</l>
                            <l>A strangely real dreamâ And then the changeâ</l>
                            <l>The tossing waters I ashore alone</l>
                            <l>Watchingâand thenâoh! that white anguished face</l>
                            <l>Uplifting from the waters as they heaved</l>
                            <l>About him sinking!</l>
                            <l>Whence came such a dream?</l>

                            <l>And happy in the faith of Heavenâs reward.</l>
                            <l>I have not quite forgotten Whose I am,</l>

                            <l>When all was over, and there was for us</l>
                            <l>No farewell but that sudden chanceâcaught look</l>
                            <l>In a busy street, and then we had passed on.</l>
                            <l rend="ti-1">The chapel bell at last. Never its sound</l>

                            <l>I warm me in the winter sunshine here,</l>

                            <l>A whisper never meant to reach my ear.</l>
                            <l>I heard yours yesterday. You âthink it strange</l>
                            <l>That I should choose to haunt the burial ground</l>
                            <l>Alive: âtwere time enough when I am dead.â</l>
                            <l>A careless speech, dear child: if you had thought,</l>

                            <l>But I will answer it. So many years</l>
                            <l>I have been old that it is out of mind</l>
                            <l>How long I have been face to face with death:</l>
                            <l>And by Godâs mercy I have long lost fear.</l>

                            <l>When I lie down I think âIt may be sleep</l>
                            <l>Or may be death,â and close my eyes in calm;</l>
                            <l>And when the sun falls warmest in the day</l>
                            <l>I have myself brought here, and often think</l>
                            <l>How soon I shall be here asleep in Christ,</l>
                            <l>And do not find it an unhappy thought.</l>
                            <l>And there are more companions here for me</l>
                            <l>Than in the convent. For I am so old</l>

                            <l>And she bedridden. Yes, no doubt, my child,</l>
                            <l>I have outlived my life and seem to youth</l>
                            <l>A sort of ghost alreadyâjust a ghost</l>
                            <l>From old old days, and so I haunt the place</l>
                            <l>Where many like me rise to be with me:</l>
                            <l>I feel them near me here. Poor child, you shrink.</l>
                            <l>Nay, if the blessed spirits really came</l>
                            <l>In presence near us, it were cause for joy:</l>
                            <l>Iâd have you long for such revealings given</l>
                            <l>From the higher world. But I meant not so much;</l>
                            <l>Only the thoughts of them and memories</l>
                            <pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7051-099"/>
                            <l>That seem to reach me from these quiet graves.</l>
                            <l>There are graves there from which, had I more strength,</l>
                            <l>I could read you many histories which, perhaps,</l>
                            <l>Might move you more to what I fain would teach</l>
                            <l>Than I can do.</l>
                            <l>See, there is one. Look left,</l>
                            <l>The corner grave beneath the sycamore,</l>
                            <l>That with the cross a little fallen slant.</l>
                            <l>There sleeps the saintliest creature! had she lived</l>
                            <l>The Church would surely have enrolled her name</l>
                            <l>Upon its calendar. She was to be</l>
                            <l>Abbess here after me, so was it planned,</l>
                            <l>And often I felt shamed to think how far</l>
                            <l>My ferventâsouled successor would surpass</l>
                            <l>My poor endeavours for the conventâs good,</l>
                            <l>And how more far surpass them in the life</l>
                            <l>Set for a pattern to the younger nuns.</l>
                            <l>But she was more than holyâlived; on her</l>
                            <l>Came wondrous power from heaven, we knew not what,</l>
                            <l>If inspiration or mere eloquence</l>
                            <l>Moved by a fervour strange to common souls.</l>
                            <pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7051-100"/>
                            <l>Myself and many others have at times,</l>
                            <l>Feeling strange influence working in our hearts</l>
                            <l>While she, the rapture on her, spoke and spoke</l>
                            <l>And took authority on her, believed</l>
                            <l>She was a chosen messenger of God,</l>
                            <l>And almost looked to see some miracle</l>
                            <l>Declare her to us. She had visions too,</l>
                            <l>But these came later: she was near her end</l>
                            <l>When they began; but that we did not know.</l>
                            <l>She died one summerâwell, well, I forget</l>
                            <l>How many years agoâbefore your birth.</l>
                            <l>Yes, on a summer evening I know,</l>
                            <l>For the sunset light came full into her room,</l>
                            <l>And âtwas the one next mine. She died one summer;</l>
                            <l>And some months earlier, at this time of year</l>
                            <l>But on a day most different from this,</l>
                            <l>All rain and chill and dreariness, they came</l>
                            <l>And woke me in the morning, telling me</l>
                            <l>Sister Annunciata had been found</l>
                            <l>Stretched in a swoon, and now so long remained</l>
                            <l>Rigid and speechless that death must be near.</l>
                            <l>She had had a vision then, the first she had;</l>
                            <pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7051-101"/>
                            <l>She told me of it with her first faint words</l>
                            <l>As she recovered. Some one came, she said,</l>
                            <l>Who had been dear to her, and, whispering close</l>
                            <l>Beside her bed where she lay taking sleep</l>
                            <l>After a halfânightâs vigil, tempted her</l>
                            <l>To pray to heaven that heaven might be for her</l>
                            <l>Eternal life with one she once had lovedâ</l>
                            <l>Whether the same who spoke I gathered not;</l>
                            <l>She said âAh! make me not remember now</l>
                            <l>Whom the saintsâ selves have bidden me forget,â</l>
                            <l>When I asked her of that matter. Well, she said,</l>
                            <l>While she was struggling in a sort of maze</l>
                            <l>Between a wish to shriek the prayer aloud</l>
                            <l>And a halfâsense of something more than her</l>
                            <l>That checked it, and the voice was making moan</l>
                            <l>âOh Eva do not lose us our last hope,â</l>
                            <l>She heard a cry that clanged out like the burst</l>
                            <l>Of treble organ pipes when the high strains</l>
                            <l>Take up the Gloria in our Easter mass,</l>
                            <l>âAnnunciata wake, wake.â Starting up,</l>
                            <l>Still sobbing, as she said, she knew a dream</l>
                            <l>Had troubled her: but there stood, where the light</l>
                            <l>That trembled dimly from the cloudâbarred moon</l>
                            <pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7051-102"/>
                            <l>In a gap of sky just fell upon the folds</l>
                            <l>Of their white raiment, two pale shimmering forms</l>
                            <l>Whose faces at the first she did not see.</l>
                            <l>And, when assured they were not also dreams</l>
                            <l>Or fancies of her fevered eyes and brain</l>
                            <l>In the sudden waking, she believed them Angels.</l>
                            <l>But when one spoke she knewâthough by what sign</l>
                            <l>She could not tell me that first timeâthey were</l>
                            <l>St Catherine of Alexandria</l>
                            <l>And our St Catherine of Sienna, each</l>
                            <l>Holding the otherâs hand. Which spoke the words</l>
                            <l>She knew notâAfterwards she grew to mark</l>
                            <l>Her visions more distinctly; that first time</l>
                            <l>She was amazed and troubled. These the words:</l>
                            <l>âWe have rescued thee, but henceforth take thou heed</l>
                            <l>Lest thou be left to struggle by thyself</l>
                            <l>And fall. Thy heart unfaithful to thy Lord</l>
                            <l>Remembers, and God says to thee âForget.ââ</l>
                            <l>And then they made as if they would have gone,</l>
                            <l>Yet turned to her again and said âApproach</l>
                            <l>And feel our presence, that thou mayest be sure</l>
                            <l>We have been with thee.â But, as she advanced,</l>
                            <l>A terror came upon her, and she fell,</l>
                            <pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7051-103"/>
                            <l>And knew no more.</l>
                            <l>Thenceforward oftentimes</l>
                            <l>She had most wondrous visions: holy saints</l>
                            <l>Appeared to her, oftenest of all those two</l>
                            <l>Whom she saw first, and heavenly harmonies</l>
                            <l>Waked her of nights, and voices spake to her.</l>
                            <l>And every day we saw her saintlier,</l>
                            <l>And felt her growing more apart from us,</l>
                            <l>As one marked out for deeper purposes</l>
                            <l>Than we could fathom. Yet she still remained</l>
                            <l>Humble among us; always she preferred</l>
                            <l>The lowest offices, and eagerly</l>
                            <l>Abased herself, âI have been proud,â she said,</l>
                            <l>âAnd even proud of pride; my penitence</l>
                            <l>Is to be meaner than the meanest here.â</l>
                            <l rend="ti-1">Ah well! you may believe that none of us</l>
                            <l>Would so account her. Though I kept her down</l>
                            <l>To the rule of strict obedience like the rest,</l>
                            <l>Believe me that, but for the honour due</l>
                            <l>Unto my office, I perceived myself</l>
                            <l>So poor beside her, so unworthy even</l>
                            <l>To kiss her garmentâs hem, I could have knelt</l>
                            <l>And cried âOh saint, take rule upon us all</l>
                            <pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7051-104"/>
                            <l>And let me be thy servant;â but I knew</l>
                            <l>What duty my high office laid on me.</l>
                            <l rend="ti-1">But think of her, proud as she well might beâ</l>
                            <l>She came of the Albizziâyoung as you,</l>
                            <l>Renowned already for the liveliest wit</l>
                            <l>And wisest, after womanâs sort, then found</l>
                            <l>Among the brightest ladyhood of Rome,</l>
                            <l>Talked of for beauty too. She, with so much</l>
                            <l>Already tasted of earthâs sweetest cup,</l>
                            <l>And so much more yet brimming to her lips</l>
                            <l>At the moment âtwas withdrawn, gave up her life</l>
                            <l>So wholly unto Heaven that, still on earth,</l>
                            <l>She seemed to see the brightness of Godâs face,</l>
                            <l>And was as if bedazzled by the light</l>
                            <l>Blind to all lower things; and so to her,</l>
                            <l>It was as if in earth was only heaven.</l>
                            <l rend="ti-1">How plain I see her dying! You may know</l>
                            <l>She died in happiness. Through several months</l>
                            <l>She saw the visions, they came oftener</l>
                            <l>And oftener, until, towards the last,</l>
                            <l>She saw them nightly. Sometimes too they came</l>
                            <l>In the broad daylight, when she would be lost,</l>
                            <l>As she was often, in her prayers alone</l>
                            <pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7051-105"/>
                            <l>In the silent chapel. When the summer grew</l>
                            <l>Towards its fall they left her utterly,</l>
                            <l>And she, already paler than you see</l>
                            <l>St Barbara in the picture in the choir</l>
                            <l>And looking nearer death, she drooped at this,</l>
                            <l>Stricken with anguish; for she read in it</l>
                            <l>A sign of wrath divine against some fault</l>
                            <l>Her holy soul discerned in the perfectness</l>
                            <l>Of a most singularly holy life.</l>
                            <l>So the blow fell on her, and she soon knewâ</l>
                            <l>The first of us she knew, and silentlyâ</l>
                            <l>That she was dying. Thenâshe knew not why,</l>
                            <l>For the voices never came againâshe felt</l>
                            <l>That she was once more in the grace of God,</l>
                            <l>And a great peace fell on her. This she told</l>
                            <l>When she sent for me on the day when first</l>
                            <l>She did not rise at dawn but quietly</l>
                            <l>Lay on her bed and said âDeath is at hand.â</l>
                            <l>Three days we watched her weakening. All the while</l>
                            <l>We seldom heard her speak; she lay asleep,</l>
                            <l>Or wept or smiled halfâsleeping. On the fourth</l>
                            <l>She roused and thanked meâthanked us all for care</l>
                            <l>And watchings in her illnessâme besides</l>
                            <pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7051-106"/>
                            <l>For some old kindness, something said or done,</l>
                            <l>I could not rightly gather what she meant,</l>
                            <l>At the time of her first coming. This I know,</l>
                            <l>Her thankfulness, so long kept in her heart,</l>
                            <l>Uttered at such a moment, dwells in me</l>
                            <l>A lesson for my guiding, and I hope</l>
                            <l>That I have seldomer failed in gentleness</l>
                            <l>And a motherâs sympathy for the young souls</l>
                            <l>New to our holy bondage who, may be,</l>
                            <l>Are sad and restless for a little while.</l>
                            <l rend="ti-1">I said to her âMy daughter, I was blessed,</l>
                            <l>Beyond my knowing, when a word of mine</l>
                            <l>Was sown to such ripe fruit in you.â Her eyes</l>
                            <l>Looked earnest at me âMothers smile like youâ;</l>
                            <l>And that was all. She spoke not much again,</l>
                            <l>Nor aught to be remembered, but, till day</l>
                            <l>Was passing into sunset she was with us,</l>
                            <l>Lying so still we scarcely could discern</l>
                            <l>Whether she waked or slept. The sunlight fell</l>
                            <l>Right on her bed at evening, and I thought</l>
                            <l>The yellow beams too strong upon her eyes;</l>
                            <l>I moved to shade them, then she took my hand,</l>
                            <l>Just touched it faintly, for her strength was gone,</l>
                            <pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7051-107"/>
                            <l>âSuch happy restâ she said, âGodâs restâ and smiled,</l>
                            <l>Then fell asleep. And presently one said</l>
                            <l>âShe is dead,â and then another âShe is dead,â</l>
                            <l>And we perceived she was no more with us,</l>
                            <l>Although the smile was strengthening on her face.</l>
                            <l rend="ti-1">Some thought it was a wonder nothing strange</l>
                            <l>Was noticed at her deathâbed; none of us</l>
                            <l>Would have thought it any wonder had there been</l>
                            <l>Tokens from Heaven plainly granted her</l>
                            <l>Before us all, and she had been shewn forth,</l>
                            <l>As one whose name was henceforth to be famed</l>
                            <l>With more than human honour. But Godâs will</l>
                            <l>Was not to crown our humble convent here</l>
                            <l>With such a glory.</l>
                            <l>When she was laid out,</l>
                            <l>I took my nieceâs baby secretly</l>
                            <l>To touch the body, thinking that, perchance,</l>
                            <l>There might be virtue in it, by Godâs grace</l>
                            <l>And with our many prayers for the poor child,</l>
                            <l>To give its poor blind eyes their sight. Poor child,</l>
                            <l>It was not so to be.</l>
                            <l>Now will you learn</l>
                            <l>A hope from that most holy life? Well, she</l>

                            <l>Who was as I have told you, had at first</l>
                            <l>A restless heart and angry at restraint,</l>
                            <l>And looked, as you may do, with wistful eyes,</l>
                            <l>Back to the world behind. I know not whyâ</l>
                            <l>She came of her freeâwill, even like myself</l>
                            <l>Who loved the quiet of the convent best</l>
                            <l>Quite from the firstâand like you too, you say,</l>
                            <l>Who do not love it yet, I think. She might,</l>
                            <l>Had she so chosen, have become the wife</l>
                            <l>Of one whose wealth and greatness were the theme</l>
                            <l>Of all the gossipries of Rome: but she</l>
                            <l>Came here and brought her proud and wayward heart,</l>
                            <l>To fret and chafe at her imprisonment,</l>
                            <l>For many days. I have told you of the end:</l>
                            <l>Do you not think it worth your envying?</l>
                            <l>And who can say âtis not within your reach?</l>
                            <l>But be persuaded, at the least, of this,</l>
                            <l>That you may learn her joy in heavenly things,</l>
                            <l>And know at last even such a peace in death.</l>

                            <l><hi>I SAW</hi> one sitting mid a waste of snow</l>
                            <l>Where never sun looked down nor silvering moon</l>
                            <l>But far around the silent skies were grey,</l>
                            <l>With chill far stars bespeckled here and there,</l>
                            <l>And a great stillness brooded over all.</l>
                            <l>And nought was there that broke the level plain,</l>
                            <l>And nothing living was there but himself.</l>
                            <l>Yet was he not alone, there stood by him</l>
                            <l>One right, one left, two forms that seemed of flesh</l>
                            <l>But blue with the first clutchings of their deaths,</l>
                            <l>Fixed rigid in the deathâpang, glassyâeyed,</l>
                            <l>Turning towards him each a vacant gaze.</l>
                            <l>And he looked on them blankly, turn by turn,</l>
                            <l>With gaze as void as theirs. He uttered speech</l>
                            <pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7051-111"/>
                            <l>That was as though his voice spoke of itself</l>
                            <l>And swayed by no part of the life in him,</l>
                            <l>In an uncadenced chant on one slow chord</l>
                            <l>Dull undulating surely to and fro.</l>

                            <l>As though they were himself. So they passed on</l>
                            <l>And far away along the dreadful waste</l>
                            <l>I heard the droning murmur of his words</l>
                            <l>But knew not what they bore. And when they died</l>
                            <l>In distance all things slept in one great hush,</l>
                            <l>The plain of snow and the unchanging sky.</l>

                                        guide.</p>
                                    <p>âSurely, signor: one, no longer ago than my fatherâs time,â
                                        said the guide; and he added, with the air of a man who
                                        believed what he was telling, âbut the first that went
                                        astray here was a pagan of old Rome, who hid himself in
                                        order to spy out and betray the blessed saints, who then
                                        dwelt and worshipped in these dismal places. You have heard
                                        the story, signor? A miracle was wrought upon the accursed
                                        one; and, ever since (for fifteen centuries at least), he
                                        has been groping in the darkness, seeking his way out of the

                        <l>Call it his deed not mine. Yea, but for him</l>
                        <l>It had not been. Yea, but for him, thy love,</l>

                        <l>Thyself half hateful that thou couldst love him.</l>
                        <l>My heart burned in me like a poisoned wound</l>

                        <l>Thy name upon my lips was as a curse,</l>
                        <l>A thousand deepest curses, hurled on him;</l>
                        <l>My burning lids at night were scorched with sight,</l>
                        <l>I saw thy smile on him. And in my ears</l>
                        <l>Was ever sound of thy low voice that spoke</l>
                        <l>That sweet sweet word of love I heard it speak,</l>
                        <l>Once while I listened to thine every breath,</l>

                        <l>Was mad with dreams of passion and despair,</l>
                        <l>Yea mad, far worse than all, with dreams of hope</l>
                        <l>That made the waking sudden misery;</l>

                        <l>And <emph rend="i">he</emph> had brought me this. Was not love hate?</l>
                        <l>Could I love thee and not hate him, thy love?</l>
