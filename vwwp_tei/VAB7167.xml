                        <p><hi rend="b">THE</hi> full African moon poured down its light from the
                            blue sky into the wide, lonely plain. The dry, sandy earth, with its
                            coating of stunted âkarrooâ bushes a few inches high, the low hills that
                            skirted the plain, the milk-bushes with their long finger-like leaves,
                            all were touched by a weird and an almost oppressive beauty as they lay
                            in the white light.</p>
                        <p>In one spot only was the solemn monotony of the plain broken. Near the
                            centre a small<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7167-007"/> solitary âkopjeâ rose.
                            Alone it lay there, a heap of round ironstones piled one upon another,
                            as over some giant's grave. Here and there a few tufts of grass or small
                            succulent plants had sprung up among its stones, and on the very summit
                            a clump of prickly-pears lifted their thorny arms, and reflected, as
                            from mirrors, the moonlight on their broad fleshy leaves. At the foot of
                            the âkopjeâ lay the homestead. First, the stone-walled âsheep kraalsâ
                            and Kaffir huts; beyond them the dwelling-houseâa square, red-brick
                            building with thatched roof. Even on its bare red walls, and the wooden
                            ladder that led up to the loft, the moonlight cast a kind of dreamy
                            beauty, and quite etherealized the low brick wall that ran before the
                            house, and which enclosed a bare patch of sand and two straggling
                            sun-flowers. On the zinc roof of the great open waggon-house, on the
                            roofs of the outbuildings that jutted from its side, the moonlight
                            glinted with a quite peculiar brightness, till it seemed<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7167-008"/> that every rib in the metal was of burnished
                            silver.</p>
                        <p>Sleep ruled everywhere, and the homestead was not less quiet than the
                            solitary plain.</p>
                        <p>In the farm-house, on her great wooden bedstead, Tant' Sannie, the
                            Boer-woman, rolled heavily in her sleep.</p>
                        <p>She had gone to bed, as she always did, in her clothes, and the night was
                            warm and the room close, and she dreamed bad dreams. Not of the ghosts
                            and devils that so haunted her waking thoughts; not of her second
                            husband, the consumptive Englishman, whose grave lay away beyond the
                            ostrich-camps, nor of her first, the young Boer; but only of the sheep's
                            trotters she had eaten for supper that night. She dreamed that one stuck
                            fast in her throat, and she rolled her huge form from side to side, and
                            snorted horribly.</p>
                        <p>In the next room, where the maid had forgotten to close the shutter, the
                            white moonlight fell in in a flood, and made it light as day.<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7167-009"/> There were two small beds against the wall.
                            In one lay a yellow-haired child, with a low forehead and a face of
                            freckles; but the loving moonlight hid defects here as elsewhere, and
                            showed only the innocent face of a child in its first sweet sleep.</p>
                        <p>The figure in the companion bed belonged of right to the moonlight, for
                            it was of quite elfin-like beauty. The child had dropped her cover on
                            the floor, and the moonlight looked in at the naked little limbs.
                            Presently she opened her eyes and looked at the moonlight that was
                            bathing her.</p>
                        <p>âEm!â she called to the sleeper in the other bed; but received no answer.
                            Then she drew the cover from the floor, turned her pillow, and pulling
                            the sheet over her head, went to sleep again.</p>
                        <p>Only in one of the outbuildings that jutted from the waggon-house there
                            was some one who was not asleep. The room was dark; door and<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7167-010"/> shutter were closed; not a ray of light
                            entered anywhere. The German overseer, to whom the room belonged, lay
                            sleeping soundly on his bed in the corner, his great arms folded, and
                            his bushy grey and black beard rising and falling on his breast. But one
                            in the room was not asleep. Two large eyes looked about in the darkness,
                            and two small hands were smoothing the patchwork quilt. The boy, who
                            slept on a box under the window, had just awakened from his first sleep.
                            He drew the quilt up to his chin, so that little peered above it but a
                            great head of silky black curls and the two black eyes. He stared about
                            in the darkness. Nothing was visible, not even the outline of one
                            worm-eaten rafter, nor of the deal table, on which lay the Bible from
                            which his father had read before they went to bed. No one could tell
                            where the tool-box was, and where the fire-place. There was something
                            very impressive to the child in the complete darkness.</p>
                        <p>At the head of his father's bed hung a great<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7167-011"/> silver hunting watch. It ticked loudly. The
                            boy listened to it, and began mechanically to count. Tickâtickâtick!
                            one, two, three, four! He lost count presently, and only listened.
                            Tickâtickâtickâtick!</p>
                        <p>It never waited; it went on inexorably; and every time it ticked <emph>a
                                man died</emph>! He raised himself a little on his elbow and
                            listened. He wished it would leave off.</p>
                        <p>How many times had it ticked since he came to lie down? A thousand times,
                            a million times, perhaps.</p>
                        <p>He tried to count again, and sat up to listen better.</p>
                        <p>âDying, dying, dying!â said the watch; âdying, dying, dying!â</p>
                        <p>He heard it distinctly. Where were they going to, all those people?</p>
                        <p>He lay down quickly, and pulled the cover up over his head: but presently
                            the silky curls reappeared.</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7167-012"/>
                        <p>âDying, dying, dying!â said the watch; âdying, dying, dying!â</p>
                        <p>He thought of the words his father had read that eveningââ<hi>For wide is
                                the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction and many
                                there be which go in thereat.</hi>â</p>
                        <p>âMany, many, many!â said the watch.</p>
                        <p>â<hi>Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, that leadeth unto
                                life, and few there be that find it.</hi>â</p>
                        <p>âFew, few, few!â said the watch.</p>
                        <p>The boy lay with his eyes wide open. He saw before him a long stream of
                            people, a great dark multitude, that moved in one direction; then they
                            came to the dark edge of the world and went over. He saw them passing on
                            before him, and there was nothing that could stop them. He thought of
                            how that stream had rolled on through all the long ages of the pastâhow
                            the old Greeks and Romans had gone over; the countless millions of China
                            and India, they were<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7167-013"/> going over now.
                            Since he had come to bed, how many had gone!</p>
                        <p>And the watch said, âEternity, eternity, eternity!â</p>
                        <p>âStop them! stop them!â cried the child.</p>
                        <p>And all the while the watch kept ticking on; just like God's will, that
                            never changes or alters, you may do what you please.</p>
                        <p>Great beads of perspiration stood on the boy's forehead. He climbed out
                            of bed and lay with his face turned to the mud floor.</p>
                        <p>âOh, God, God! save them!â he cried in agony. âOnly some, only a few!
                            Only for each moment I am praying here one!â He folded his little hands
                            upon his head. âGod! God! save them!â</p>
                        <p>He grovelled on the floor.</p>
                        <p>Oh, the long, long ages of the past, in which they had gone over! Oh, the
                            long, long future, in which they would pass away! Oh,<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7167-014"/> God! the long, long, long eternity, which has
                            no end!</p>
                        <p>The child wept; and crept closer to the ground.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="b">THE</hi> farm by daylight was not as the farm by moonlight.
                            The plain was a weary flat of loose red sand, sparsely covered by dry
                            karroo-bushes, that cracked beneath the tread like tinder, and showed
                            the red earth everywhere. Here and there a milk-bush lifted its
                            pale-coloured rods, and in every direction the ants and beetles ran
                            about in the blazing sand. The red walls of the farm-house, the zinc
                            roofs of the out-buildings, the stone walls of the âkraals,â all
                            reflected the fierce sunlight, till the eye ached and blenched. No tree
                            or shrub was to be seen far or near. The two sunflowers that stood<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7167-015"/> before the door, out-stared by the
                            sun, drooped their brazen faces to the sand; and the little cicada-like
                            insects cried aloud among the stones of the âkopje.â</p>
                        <p>The Boer-woman, seen by daylight, was even less lovely than, when, in
                            bed, she rolled and dreamed. She sat on a chair in the great front room,
                            with her feet on a wooden stove, and wiped her flat face with the corner
                            of her apron, and drank coffee, and in Cape Dutch swore that the beloved
                            weather was damned. Less lovely, too, by daylight was the dead
                            Englishman's child, her little step-daughter, upon whose freckles and
                            low, wrinkled forehead the sunlight had no mercy.</p>
                        <p>âLyndall,â the child said to her little orphan cousin, who sat with her
                            on the floor threading beads, âhow is it your beads never fall off your
                            needle?â</p>
                        <p>âI try,â said the little one gravely, moistening her tiny finger. âThat
                            is why.â</p>
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7167-016"/>
                        <p>The overseer, seen by daylight, was a huge German, wearing a shabby suit,
                            and with a childish habit of rubbing his hands and nodding his head
                            prodigiously when pleased at anything. He stood out at the kraals in the
                            blazing sun, explaining to two Kaffer boys the approaching end of the
                            world. The boys, as they cut the cakes of dung, winked at each other,
                            and worked as slowly as they possibly could; but the German never saw
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Away, beyond the âkopje,â Waldo his son herded the ewes and lambsâa small
                            and dusty herdâpowdered all over from head to foot with red sand,
                            wearing a ragged coat and shoes of undressed leather, through whose
                            holes the toes looked out. His hat was too large, and had sunk down to
                            his eyes, concealing completely the silky black curls. It was a curious
                            small figure. His flock gave him little trouble. It was too hot for them
                            to move far; they gathered round every little milk-bush, as though
                                they<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7167-017"/> hoped to find shade, and stood
                            there motionless in clumps. He himself crept under a shelving rock that
                            lay at the foot of the âkopje,â stretched himself on his stomach, and
                            waved his dilapidated little shoes in the air.</p>
                        <p>Soon, from the blue bag where he kept his dinner, he produced a fragment
                            of slate, an arithmetic, and a pencil. Proceeding to put down a sum with
                            solemn and earnest demeanour, he began to add it up aloud: âSix and two
                            is eightâand four is twelveâand two is fourteenâand four is eighteen.â
                            Here he paused. âAnd four is eighteenâandâfourâisâeighteen.â The last
                            was very much drawled. Slowly the pencil slipped from his fingers, and
                            the slate followed it into the sand. For a while he lay motionless, then
                            began muttering to himself, folded his little arms, laid his head down
                            upon them, and might have been asleep, but for the muttering sound that
                            from time to time proceeded from him. A curious old ewe came to sniff at
                            him; but it was<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7167-018"/> long before he raised
                            his head. When he did, he looked at the far-off hills with his heavy
                            eyes.</p>
                        <p>âYe shall receiveâye shall receiveâ<hi>shall, shall, shall,</hi>â he
                            muttered.</p>
                        <p>He sat up then. Slowly the dulness and heaviness melted from his face; it
                            became radiant. Mid-day had come now, and the sun's rays were poured
                            down vertically; the earth throbbed before the eye.</p>
                        <p>The boy stood up quickly, and cleared a small space from the bushes which
                            covered it. Looking carefully, he found twelve small stones of somewhat
                            the same size; kneeling down, he arranged them carefully on the cleared
                            space in a square pile, in shape like an altar. Then he walked to the
                            bag where his dinner was kept; in it was a mutton chop and a large slice
                            of brown bread. The boy took them out and turned the bread over in his
                            hand, deeply considering it. Finally he threw it away and walked to the
                            altar with the meat, and laid it down on<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7167-019"/> the stones. Close by in the red sand he knelt down. Sure, never since
                            the beginning of the world was there so ragged and so small a priest. He
                            took off his great hat and placed it solemnly on the ground, then closed
                            his eyes and folded his hands. He prayed aloud.</p>
                        <p>âOh, God, my Father, I have made Thee a sacrifice. I have only twopence,
                            so I cannot buy a lamb. If the lambs were mine, I would give Thee one;
                            but now I have only this meat; it is my dinner-meat. Please, my Father,
                            send fire down from heaven to burn it. Thou hast said, Whosoever shall
                            say unto this mountain, Be thou cast into the sea, nothing doubting, it
                            shall be done. I ask for the sake of Jesus Christ. Amen.â</p>
                        <p>He knelt down with his face upon the ground, and he folded his hands upon
                            his curls. The fierce sun poured down its heat upon his head and upon
                            his altar. When he looked up he knew what he should seeâthe glory of
                            God! For fear his very heart stood still, his breath<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7167-020"/> came heavily; he was half suffocated. He
                            dared not look up. Then at last he raised himself. Above him was the
                            quiet blue sky, about him the red earth; there were the clumps of silent
                            ewes and his altarâthat was all.</p>
                        <p>He looked upânothing broke the intense stillness of the blue overhead. He
                            looked round in astonishment, then he bowed again, and this time longer
                            than before.</p>
                        <p>When he raised himself the second time all was unaltered. Only the sun
                            had melted the fat of the little mutton chop, and it ran down upon the
                            stones.</p>
                        <p>Then, the third time he bowed himself. When at last he looked up, some
                            ants had come to the meat on the altar. He stood up and drove them away.
                            Then he put his hat on his hot curls, and sat in the shade. He clasped
                            his hands about his knees. He sat to watch what would come to pass. The
                            glory of the Lord God Almighty! He knew he should see it.</p>
                        <pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7167-021"/>
                        <p>âMy dear God is trying me,â he said; and he sat there through the fierce
                            heat of the afternoon. Still he watched and waited when the sun began to
                            slope, and when it neared the horizon and the sheep began to cast long
                            shadows across the <choice>
                                <sic>karro</sic>
                                <corr>karroo</corr>
                            </choice>, he still sat there. He hoped when the first rays touched the
                            hills till the sun dipped behind them and was gone. Then he called his
                            ewes together, and broke down the altar, and threw the meat far, far
                            away into the field.</p>
                        <p>He walked home behind his flock. His heart was heavy. He reasoned so:
                            âGod cannot lie. I had faith. No fire came. I am like CainâI am not His.
                            He will not hear my prayer. God hates me.â</p>
                        <p>The boy's heart was heavy. When he reached the âkraalâ gate the two girls
                            met him.</p>
                        <p>âCome,â said the yellow-haired Em, âlet us play âcoop.â There is still
                            time before it gets quite dark. You, Waldo, go and hide on the<pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7167-022"/> âkopjeâ; Lyndall and I will shut eyes here,
                            and we will not look.â</p>
                        <p>The girls hid their faces in the stone wall of the sheep-kraal, and the
                            boy clambered half way up the âkopje.â He crouched down between two
                            stones and gave the call. Just then the milk-herd came walking out of
                            the cow-kraal with two pails. He was an ill-looking Kaffir.</p>
                        <p>âAh!â thought the boy, âperhaps he will die to-night, and go to hell! I
                            must pray for him, I must pray!â</p>
                        <p>Then he thoughtââWhere am <emph>I</emph> going to?â and he prayed
                            desperately.</p>
                        <p>âAh! this is not right at all,â little Em said, peeping between the
                            stones, and finding him in a very curious posture. âWhat
                                <emph>are</emph> you doing Waldo? It is not the play, you know. You
                            should run out when we come to the white stone. Ah, you do not play
                            nicely.â</p>
                        <p>âIâI will play nicely now,â said the boy,<pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7167-023"/> coming out and standing sheepishly before them; âIâI only forgot; I
                            will play now.â</p>
                        <p>âHe has been to sleep,â said freckled Em.</p>
                        <p>âNo,â said beautiful little Lyndall, looking curiously at him; âhe has

                        <p><hi rend="b">ONE</hi> night, two years after, the boy sat alone on the
                            âkopje.â He had crept softly from his father's room and come there. He
                            often did, because, when he prayed or cried aloud, his father might
                            awake and hear him; and none knew his great sorrow, and none knew his
                            grief, but he himself, and he buried them deep in his heart.</p>
                        <p>He turned up the brim of his great hat and looked at the moon, but most
                            at the leaves of the prickly pear that grew just before him. They
                            glinted, and glinted, and glinted, just<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7167-024"/>
                            like his own heartâcold, so hard, and very wicked. His physical heart
                            had pain also; it seemed full of little bits of glass, that hurt. He had
                            sat there for half an hour, and he dared not go back to the close
                            house.</p>
                        <p>He felt horribly lonely. There was not one thing so wicked as he in all
                            the world, and he knew it. He folded his arms and began to cryânot
                            aloud; he sobbed without making any sound, and his tears left scorched
                            marks where they fell. He could not pray; he had prayed night and day
                            for so many months; and to-night he could not pray. When he left off
                            crying, he held his aching head with his brown hands. If one might have
                            gone up to him and touched him kindly, poor, ugly little thing! I think
                            his heart was well nigh broken.</p>
                        <p>With his swollen eyes he sat there on a flat stone at the very top of the
                            âkopjeâ; and the tree, with every one of its wicked leaves, blinked, and
                            blinked, and blinked at him.<pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7167-025"/> Presently
                            he began to cry again, and then stopped his crying to look at it. He was
                            quiet for a long while, then he knelt up slowly and bent forward. There
                            was a secret he had carried in his heart for a year. He had not dared to
                            look at it; he had not whispered it to himself, but for a year he had
                            carried it. âI hate God!â he said. The wind took the words and ran away
                            with them, among the stones, and through the leaves of the prickly pear.
                            He thought it died away half down the âkopje.â He had told it now!</p>
                        <p>âI love Jesus Christ, but I hate God.â</p>
                        <p>The wind carried away that sound as it had done the first. Then he got up
                            and buttoned his old coat about him. He knew he was certainly lost now;
                            he did not care. If half the world were to be lost, why not he too? He
                            would not pray for mercy any more. Better soâbetter to know certainly.
                            It was ended now. Better so.</p>
                        <pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7167-026"/>
                        <p>He began scrambling down the sides of the âkopjeâ to go home.</p>
                        <p>Better so!âBut oh, the loneliness, the agonized pain! for that night, and
                            for nights on nights to come! The anguish that sleeps all day on the
                            heart like a heavy worm, and wakes up at night to feed!</p>
                        <p>There are some of us who in after years say to Fate, âNow deal us your
                            hardest blow, give us what you will; but let us never again suffer as we
                            suffered when we were children.â</p>
                        <p>The barb in the arrow of childhood's suffering is thisâits intense
                            loneliness, its intense agony.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">AT</hi> last came the year of the great drought, the year of
                        eighteen-sixty-two, I think. From end to end of the land the earth cried for
                        water. Man and beast turned their eyes to the pitiless sky, that like the
                        roof of some brazen oven arched overhead. On the farm, day after day, month
                        after month, the water in the dams fell lower and lower; the sheep died in
                        the fields; the cattle, scarcely able to crawl, tottered as they moved from
                        spot to spot in search of food. Week after week, month after month, the sun
                        looked down from the cloudless sky, till the karroo-bushes were leafless
                        sticks, broken into the earth, and the earth itself was naked and bare;<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7167-028"/> and only the milk-bushes, like old hags,
                        pointed their shrivelled fingers heavenward, praying for the rain that never
                        came.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="*   *   *   *   *"/>
                    <p>It was on an afternoon of a long day in that thirsty summer, that on the side
                        of the âkopjeâ furthest from the homestead the two girls sat. They were
                        somewhat grown since the days when they played hide-and-seek there, but they
                        were mere children still.</p>
                    <p>Their dress was of dark coarse stuff; their common blue pinafores reached to
                        their ankles, and on their feet they wore home-made âvel-schoen.â</p>
                    <p>They sat under a shelving rock, on the surface of which were still visible
                        some old Bushman paintings, their red and black pigments having been
                        preserved through long years from wind and rain by the overhanging ledge;
                        grotesque oxen, elephants, rhinoceroses, and a one-horned beast, such as no
                        man ever has seen or ever shall.</p>
                    <pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7167-029"/>
                    <p>The girls sat with their backs to the paintings. In their laps were a few
                        fern and ice-plant leaves, which by dint of much searching they had gathered
                        under the rocks.</p>
                    <p>Em took off her big brown kappje and began vigorously to fan her red face
                        with it; but her companion bent low over the leaves in her lap, and at last
                        took up an ice-plant leaf and fastened it on to the front of her blue
                        pinafore with a pin.</p>
                    <p>âDiamonds must look as these drops do,â she said, carefully bending over the
                        leaf, and crushing one crystal drop with her delicate little finger. âWhen
                        I,â she said, âam grown up, I shall wear real diamonds, exactly like these
                        in my hair.â</p>
                    <p>Her companion opened her eyes and wrinkled her low forehead.</p>
                    <p>âWhere will you find them, Lyndall? The stones are only crystals that we
                        picked up yesterday. Old Otto says so.â</p>
                    <pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7167-030"/>
                    <p>âAnd you think that I am going to stay <emph>here</emph> always?â</p>
                    <p>The lip trembled scornfully.</p>
                    <p>âAh, no,â said her companion. âI suppose some day we shall go somewhere; but
                        now we are only twelve, and we cannot marry till we are seventeen. Four
                        years, fiveâthat is a long time to wait. And we might not have diamonds if
                        we did marry.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd you think that I am going to stay here till then?â</p>
                    <p>âWell, where <emph>are</emph> you going?â asked her companion.</p>
                    <p>The girl crushed an ice-plant leaf between her fingers.</p>
                    <p>âTant' Sannie is a miserable old woman,â she said. âYour father married her
                        when he was dying, because he thought she would take better care of the
                        farm, and of us, than an Englishwoman. He said we should be taught and sent
                        to school. Now she saves every<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7167-031"/> farthing for
                        herself, buys us not even one old book. She does not ill-use usâwhy? Because
                        she is afraid of your father's ghost. Only this morning she told her
                        Hottentot that she would have beaten you for breaking the plate, but that
                        three nights ago she heard a rustling and a grunting behind the pantry door,
                        and knew it was your father coming to âspookâ her. She is a miserable old
                        woman,â said the girl, throwing the leaf from her; âbut I intend to go to
                        school.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd if she won't let you?â</p>
                    <p>âI shall make her.â</p>
                    <p>âHow?â</p>
                    <p>The child took not the slightest notice of the last question, and folded her
                        small arms across her knees.</p>
                    <p>âWhy do you want to go, Lyndall?â</p>
                    <p>âThere is nothing helps in this world,â said the child slowly, âbut to be
                        very wise, and to know everythingâto be clever.â</p>
                    <pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7167-032"/>
                    <p>âBut I should not like to go to school!â persisted the small freckled
                        face.</p>
                    <p>âAnd you do not need to. When you are seventeen this Boer-woman will go; you
                        will have this farm and everything that is upon it for your own; but I,â
                        said Lyndall, âwill have nothing. I must learn.â</p>
                    <p>âOh, Lyndall! <emph>I</emph> will give you some of my sheep,â said Em, with a
                        sudden burst of pitying generosity.</p>
                    <p>âI do not want your sheep,â said the girl slowly; âI want things of my own.
                        When I am grown up,â she added, the flush on her delicate features deepening
                        at every word, âthere will be nothing that I do not know. I shall be rich,
                        very rich; and I shall wear, not only for best, but every day, a pure white
                        silk, and little rose-buds, like the lady in Tant' Sannie's bedroom, and my
                        petticoats will be embroidered, not only at the bottom, but all
                        through.â</p>
                    <pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7167-033"/>
                    <p>The lady in Tant' Sannie's bedroom was a gorgeous creature from a
                        fashion-sheet, which the Boer-woman, somewhere obtaining, had pasted up at
                        the foot of her bed, to be profoundly admired by the children.</p>
                    <p>âIt would be very nice,â said Em; but it seemed a dream of quite too
                        transcendent a glory ever to be realized.</p>
                    <p>At this instant there appeared at the foot of the âkopjeâ two figuresâthe
                        one, a dog, white and sleek, one yellow ear hanging down over his left eye;
                        the other, his master, a lad of fourteen, and no other than the boy Waldo,
                        grown into a heavy, slouching youth of fourteen. The dog mounted the âkopjeâ
                        quickly, his master followed slowly. He wore an aged jacket much too large
                        for him, and rolled up at the wrists, and, as of old, a pair of dilapidated
                        âvel-schoensâ and a felt hat. He stood before the two girls at last.</p>
                    <p>âWhat have you been doing to-day?â asked<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7167-034"/>
                        Lyndall, lifting her eyes to his face.</p>
                    <p>âLooking after ewes and lambs below the dam. Here!â he said, holding out his
                        hand awkwardly, âI brought them for you.â</p>
                    <p>There were a few green blades of tender grass.</p>
                    <p>âWhere did you find them?â</p>
                    <p>âOn the dam wall.â</p>
                    <p>She fastened them beside the leaf on her blue pinafore.</p>
                    <p>âThey look nice there,â said the boy, awkwardly rubbing his great hands and
                        watching her.</p>
                    <p>âYes; but the pinafore spoils it all; it is not pretty.â</p>
                    <p>He looked at it closely.</p>
                    <p>âYes, the squares are ugly; but it looks nice upon youâbeautiful.â</p>
                    <p>He now stood silent before them, his great hands hanging loosely at either
                        side.</p>
                    <pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7167-035"/>
                    <p>âSome one has come to-day,â he mumbled out suddenly, when the idea struck
                        him.</p>
                    <p>âWho?â asked both girls.</p>
                    <p>âAn Englishman on foot.â</p>
                    <p>âWhat does he look like?â asked Em.</p>
                    <p>âI did not notice; but he has a very large nose,â said the boy slowly. âHe
                        asked the way to the house.â</p>
                    <p>âDidn't he tell you his name?â</p>
                    <p>âYesâBonaparte Blenkins.â</p>
                    <p>âBonaparte!â said Em, âwhy that is like the reel Hottentot Hans plays on the
                        violinâ <q>

                    <p>âThere was a living man called Bonaparte once,â said she of the great

                    <p>âAh yes, I know,â said Emââthe poor prophet whom the lions ate. I am always

                    <p>âHe was the greatest man who ever lived,â she saidââthe man I like best.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd what did he do?â asked Em, conscious that she had made a mistake, and
                        that her prophet was not the man.</p>
                    <p>âHe was one man, only one,â said her little companion slowly, âyet all the
                        people in the world feared him. He was not born great, he was common as we
                        are; yet he was master of the world at last. Once he was only a little
                        child, then he was a lieutenant, then he was a general, then he was an
                        emperor. When he said a thing to himself he never forgot it. He waited, and
                        waited, and waited, and it came at last.â</p>
                    <p>âHe must have been very happy,â said Em.</p>
                    <p>âI do not know,â said Lyndall; âbut he had what he said he would have, and
                        that is better than being happy. He was their master, and all the people
                        were white with fear of him. They joined together to fight him. He was<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7167-037"/> one and they were many, and they got him
                        down at last. They were like the wild cats when their teeth are fast in a
                        great dog, like cowardly wild cats,â said the child, âthey would not let him
                        go. There were many; he was only <emph>one</emph>. They sent him to an
                        island on the sea, a lonely island, and kept him there fast. He was one man,
                        and they were many, and they were terrified at him. It was glorious!â said
                        the child.</p>
                    <p>âAnd what then?â said Em.</p>
                    <p>âThen he was alone there in that island with men to watch him always,â said
                        her companion, slowly and quietly, âand in the long lonely nights he used to
                        lie awake and think of the things he had done in the old days, and the
                        things he would do if they let him go again. In the day when he walked near
                        the shore it seemed to him that the sea all around him was a cold chain
                        about his body pressing him to death.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd then?â said Em, much interested.</p>
                    <pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7167-038"/>
                    <p>âHe died there in that island; he never got away.â</p>
                    <p>âIt is rather a nice story,â said Em; âbut the end is sad.â</p>
                    <p>âIt is a terrible, hateful ending,â said the little teller of the story,
                        leaning forward on her folded arms; âand the worst is, it is true. I have
                        noticed,â added the child very deliberately, âthat it is only the made-up
                        stories that end nicely; the true ones all end so.â</p>
                    <p>As she spoke the boy's dark, heavy eyes rested on her face.</p>
                    <p>âYou have read it, have you not?â</p>
                    <p>He nodded. âYes; but the brown history tells only what he did, not what he
                        thought.â</p>
                    <p>âIt was in the brown history that I read of him,â said the girl; âbut I
                            <emph>know</emph> what he thought. Books do not tell everything.â</p>
                    <p>âNo,â said the boy, slowly drawing nearer to her and sitting down at her
                        feet. âWhat you want to know they never tell.â</p>
                    <pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7167-039"/>
                    <p>Then the children fell into silence, till Doss, the dog, growing uneasy at
                        its long continuance, sniffed at one and the other, and his master broke
                        forth suddenly,â</p>
                    <p>âIf <emph>they</emph> could talk, if <emph>they</emph> could tell us now!â he
                        said, moving his hand out over the surrounding objectsââthen we would know
                        something. This âkopje,â if it could tell us how it came here! The âPhysical
                        Geographyâ says,â he went on most rapidly and confusedly, âthat what were
                        dry lands now were once lakes; and what I think is thisâthese low hills were
                        once the shores of a lake; this âkopjeâ is some of the stones that were at
                        the bottom, rolled together by the water. But there is thisâhow did the
                        water come to make one heap here alone, in the centre of the plain?â It was
                        a ponderous question; no one volunteered an answer. âWhen I was small,â said
                        the boy, âI always looked at it and wondered, and I thought a great giant
                        was buried under it.<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7167-040"/> Now I know the water
                        must have done it; but how? It is very wonderful. Did one little stone come
                        first, and stop the others as they rolled?â said the boy with earnestness,
                        in a low voice, more as speaking to himself than to them.</p>
                    <p>âOh, Waldo, God put the little âkopjeâ here,â said Em with solemnity.</p>
                    <p>âBut how did He put it here?â</p>
                    <p>âBy wanting.â</p>
                    <p>âBut how did the wanting bring it here?â</p>
                    <p>âBecause it did.â</p>
                    <p>The last words were uttered with the air of one who produces a clinching
                        argument. What effect it had on the questioner was not evident, for he made
                        no reply, and turned away from her.</p>
                    <p>Drawing closer to Lyndall's feet, he said after a while, in a low voice,â</p>
                    <p>âLyndall, has it never seemed to you that the stones <emph>were</emph>
                        talking with you? Sometimes,â he added in a yet lower tone, âI lie under
                            there<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7167-041"/> with my sheep, and it seems that
                        the stones are really speakingâspeaking of the old things, of the time when
                        the strange fishes and animals lived that are turned into stone now, and the
                        lakes were here; and then of the time when the little Bushmen lived here, so
                        small and so ugly, and used to sleep in the wild dog holes, and in the
                        âsloots,â and eat snakes, and shoot the bucks with their poisoned arrows. It
                        was one of them, one of these old wild Bushmen, that painted those,â said
                        the boy, nodding toward the picturesââone who was different from the rest.
                        He did not know why, but he wanted to make something beautifulâhe wanted to
                        make something, so he made these. He worked hard, very hard, to find the
                        juice to make the paint; and then he found this place where the rocks hang
                        over, and he painted them. To us they are only strange things, that make us
                        laugh; but to him they were very beautiful.â</p>
                    <pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7167-042"/>
                    <p>The children had turned round and looked at the pictures.</p>
                    <p>âHe used to kneel here naked, painting, painting, painting; and he wondered
                        at the things he made himself,â said the boy, rising and moving his hand in
                        deep excitement. âNow the Boers have shot them all, so that we never see a
                        little yellow face peeping out among the stones; and the wild bucks have
                        gone, and those days, and we are here. But we will be gone soon, and only
                        the stones will be on here, looking at everything like they look now. Of
                        course I know,â the fellow added slowly, âthat it is I who am thinking, not
                        they who are talking; but it seems as though it were them. Has it never
                        seemed to you that things that do not live are talkig to you, Lyndall?â</p>
                    <p>âNo, it never seems so to me,â she answered.</p>
                    <p>The sun had dipped now below the hills, and the boy, suddenly remembering the
                        ewes and lambs, started to his feet.</p>
                    <pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7167-043"/>
                    <p>âLet us also go to the house and see who has come,â said Em, as the boy
                        shuffled away to rejoin his flock, while Doss ran at his heels, snapping at
                        the ends of the torn trousers as they fluttered in the wind.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                    <head type="sub">I WAS A STRANGER, AND YE TOOK ME IN.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="b">AS</hi> the two girls rounded the side of the âkopje,â an
                        unusual scene presented itself. A large group was gathered at the back door
                        of the homestead.</p>
                    <p>On the door-step stood the Boer-woman, a hand on each hip, her face red and
                        fiery, her head nodding fiercely. At her feet sat the yellow Hottentot maid,
                        her satellite, and around stood the black Kaffir maids, with blankets
                        twisted round their half-naked figures. Two, who stamped mealies in a wooden
                        block, held the great stampers in their hands, and stared stupidly at the
                        object of attraction. It certainly was not to look at the old German
                            overseer,<pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7167-045"/> who stood in the centre of
                        the group, that they had all gathered together. His salt-and-pepper suit,
                        grizzly black beard, and grey eyes were as familiar to every one on the farm
                        as the red gables of the homestead itself; but beside him stood the
                        stranger, and on him all eyes were fixed. Ever and anon the new-comer cast a
                        glance over his pendulous red nose to the spot where the Boer-woman stood,
                        and smiled faintly.</p>
                    <p>âI'm not a child,â cried the Boer-woman, in low Cape Dutch, âand I wasn't
                        born yesterday. No, by the Lord, no! You can't take <emph>me</emph> in! My
                        mother didn't wean me on Monday. One wink of my eye, and I see the whole
                        thing. I'll have no tramps sleeping on my farm,â cried Tant' Sannie blowing.
                        âNo, by the Devil, no! not though he had sixty-times-six red noses.â</p>
                    <p>There the German overseer mildly interposed that the man was not a tramp, but
                        a highly<pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7167-046"/> respectable individual, whose
                        horse had died by an accident three days before.</p>
                    <p>âDon't tell me,â cried the Boer-woman; âthe man isn't born that can take
                            <emph>me</emph> in. If he'd had money wouldn't he have bought a horse?
                        Men who walk are thieves, liars, murderers, Rome's priests, seducers! I see
                        the Devil in his nose!â cried Tant' Sannie shaking her fist at him; âand to
                        come walking into the house of this Boer's child, and shaking hands as
                        though he came on horseback! Oh, no, no!â</p>
                    <p>The stranger took off his hat, a tall, battered chimney-pot, and disclosed a
                        bald head, at the back of which was a little fringe of curled white hair;
                        and he bowed to Tant' Sannie.</p>
                    <p>âWhat does she remark, my friend?â he inquired, turning his cross-wise
                        looking eyes on the old German.</p>
                    <p>The German rubbed his old hands and hesitated.</p>
                    <p>âAhâwellâahâtheâDutchâyou knowâ<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7167-047"/> do not like
                        people who walkâin this countryâah!â</p>
                    <p>âMy dear friend,â said the stranger, laying his hand on the German's arm, âI
                        should have bought myself another horse, but crossing, five days ago, a full
                        river, I lost my purseâa purse with five hundred pounds in it. I spent five
                        days on the bank of the river trying to find itâcouldn't. Paid a Kaffir nine
                        pounds to go in and look for it at the risk of his lifeâcouldn't find
                        it.â</p>
                    <p>The German would have translated this information, but the Boer-woman gave no
                        ear.</p>
                    <p>âNo, no; he goes to-night. See how he looks at meâa poor unprotected female!
                        If he wrongs me, who is to do me right?â cried Tant' Sannie.</p>
                    <p>âI think,â said the German in an undertone, âif you didn't look at her quite
                        so much it might be advisable. Sheâahâsheâmightâimagine that you liked her
                        too well,âin factâahââ</p>
                    <pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7167-048"/>
                    <p>âCertainly, my dear friend, certainly,â said the stranger. âI shall not look
                        at her.â</p>
                    <p>Saying this, he turned his nose full upon a small Kaffir of two years old.
                        That small naked Kaffir became instantly so terrified that he fled to his
                        mother's blanket for protection, howling horribly.</p>
                    <p>Upon this the new-comer fixed his eyes pensively on the stamp-block, folding
                        his hands on the head of his cane. His boots were broken, but he still had
                        the cane of a gentleman.</p>
                    <p>âYo vaggabonds se Engelschman!â said Tant' Sannie, looking straight at
                        him.</p>
                    <p>This was a near approach to plain English; but the man contemplated the block
                        abstractedly, wholly unconscious that any antagonism was being displayed
                        toward him.</p>
                    <p>âYou might not be a Scotchman, or anything of that kind, might you?â
                        suggested the German. âIt is the English that she hates.â</p>
                    <p>âMy dear friend,â said the stranger, âI am<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7167-049"/>
                        Irish every inch of meâfather Irish, mother Irish. I've not a drop of
                        English blood in my veins.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd you might not be married, might you?â persisted the German. âIf you had
                        a wife and children, now? Dutch people do not like those who are not
                        married.â</p>
                    <p>âAh,â said the stranger, looking tenderly at the block, âI have a dear wife
                        and three sweet little childrenâtwo lovely girls and a noble boy.â</p>
                    <p>This information having been conveyed to the Boer-woman, she, after some
                        further conversation, appeared slightly mollified; but remained firm to her
                        conviction that the man's designs were evil.</p>
                    <p>âFor, dear Lord!â she cried; âall Englishmen are ugly; but was there ever
                        such a red-rag-nosed thing with broken boots and crooked eyes before. Take
                        him to your room,â she cried to the German; âbut all the sin he does I lay
                        at your door.â</p>
                    <pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7167-050"/>
                    <p>The German having told him how matters were arranged, the stranger made a
                        profound bow to Tant' Sannie and followed his host, who led the way to his
                        own little room.</p>
                    <p>âI thought she would come to her better self soon,â the German said joyously.
                        âTant' Sannie is not wholly bad, far from it, far.â Then seeing his
                        companion cast a furtive glance at him, which he mistook for one of
                        surprise, he added quickly, âAh, yes, yes; we are all a primitive people
                        hereânot very lofty. We deal not in titles. Every one is Tanta and Oomâaunt
                        and uncle. This may be my room,â he said, opening the door. âIt is rough,
                        the room is rough; not a palaceânot quite. But it may be better than the
                        fields, a little better,â he said, glancing round at his companion. âCome
                        in, come in. There is something to eatâa mouthful: not the fare of emperors
                        and kings; but we do not starve, not yet,â he said, rubbing his hands
                        together and looking<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7167-051"/> round with a pleased,
                        half-nervous smile on his old face.</p>
                    <p>âMy friend, my dear friend,â said the stranger, seizing him by the hand, âmay
                        the Lord bless you, the Lord bless and reward youâthe God of the fatherless
                        and the stranger. But for you I would this night have slept in the fields,
                        with the dews of heaven upon my head.â</p>
                    <p>Late that evening Lyndall came down to the cabin with the German's rations.
                        Through the tiny square window the light streamed forth, and without
                        knocking she raised the latch and entered. There was a fire burning on the
                        hearth, and it cast its ruddy glow over the little dingy room, with its
                        worm-eaten rafters and mud floor, and broken white-washed walls. A curious
                        little place, filled with all manner of articles. Next to the fire was a
                        great tool-box; beyond that the little bookshelf with its well-worn books;
                        beyond that, in the corner, a heap<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7167-052"/> of
                        filled and empty grain-bags. From the rafters hung down straps, âreims,â old
                        boots, bits of harness, and a string of onions. The bed was in another
                        corner, covered by a patchwork quilt of faded red lions, and divided from
                        the rest of the room by a blue curtain, now drawn back. On the mantelshelf
                        was an endless assortment of little bags and stones; and on the wall hung a
                        map of South Germany, with a red line drawn through it to show where the
                        German had wandered. This place was the one home the girls had known for
                        many a year. The house where Tant' Sannie lived and ruled was a place to
                        sleep in, to eat in, not to be happy in. It was in vain she told them they
                        were grown too old to go there; every morning and evening found them there.
                        Were there not too many golden memories hanging about the old place for them
                        to leave it?</p>
                    <p>Long winter nights, when they had sat round the fire and roasted potatoes,
                        and asked riddles,<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7167-053"/> and the old man had told
                        of the little German village, where, fifty years before, a little German boy
                        had played at snowballs, and had carried home the knitted stockings of a
                        little girl who afterward became Waldo's mother; did they not seem to see
                        the German peasant girls walking about with their wooden shoes and yellow,
                        braided hair, and the little children eating their suppers out of little
                        wooden bowls when the good mothers called them in to have their milk and
                        potatoes?</p>
                    <p>And were there not yet better times than these? Moonlight nights, when they
                        romped about the door, with the old man, yet more a child than any of them,
                        and laughed, till the old roof of the waggon-house rang.</p>
                    <p>Or, best of all, were there not warm, dark, starlight nights, when they sat
                        together on the door-step, holding each other's hands, singing German hymns,
                        their voices rising clear in the still night airâtill the German would
                            draw<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7167-054"/> away his hand suddenly to wipe
                        quickly a tear the children must not see? Would they not sit looking up at
                        the stars and talking of themâof the dear Southern Cross, red, fiery Mars,
                        Orion, with his belt, and the Seven Mysterious Sistersâand fall to
                        speculating over them? How old were they? Who dwelt in them? And the old
                        German would say that perhaps the souls we loved lived in them;
                            <emph>there</emph>, in that little twinkling point was perhaps the
                        little girl whose stockings he had carried home; and the children would look
                        up at it lovingly, and call it âOld Otto's star.â Then they would fall to
                        deeper speculationsâof the times and seasons wherein the heavens shall be
                        rolled together as a scroll, and the stars shall fall as a fig-tree casteth
                        her untimely figs, and there shall be time no longer; âwhen the Son of man
                        shall come in His glory, and all His holy angels with Him.â In lower and
                        lower tones they would talk, till at last they fell into whispers; then they
                            would<pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7167-055"/> wish good night softly, and walk
                        home hushed and quiet.</p>
                    <p>To-night, when Lyndall looked in, Waldo sat before the fire watching a pot
                        which simmered there, with his slate and pencil in his hand; his father sat
                        at the table buried in the columns of a three-weeks-old newspaper; and the
                        stranger lay stretched on the bed in the corner, fast asleep, his mouth
                        open, his great limbs stretched out loosely, betokening much weariness. The
                        girl put the rations down upon the table, snuffed the candle, and stood
                        looking at the figure on the bed.</p>
                    <p>âOld Otto,â she said presently, laying her hand down on the newspaper, and
                        causing the old German to look up over his glasses, âhow long did that man
                        say he had been walking?â</p>
                    <p>âSince this morning, poor fellow! A gentlemanânot accustomed to walkingâhorse
                        diedâpoor fellow!â said the German, pushing out his lip and glancing
                        commiseratingly over his<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7167-056"/> spectacles in the
                        direction of the bed where the stranger lay, with his flabby double chin,
                        and broken boots through which the flesh shone.</p>
                    <p>âAnd do you believe him, Uncle Otto?â</p>
                    <p>âBelieve him? why of course I do. He himself told me the story three times
                            <emph>distinctly</emph>.â</p>
                    <p>âIf,â said the girl slowly, âhe had walked for only one day his boots would
                        not have looked so; and ifââ</p>
                    <p>â<emph>If!</emph>â said the German starting up in his chair, irritated that
                        any one should doubt such irrefragable evidenceââ<emph>if!</emph> Why, he
                        told me himself! Look how he lies there,â added the German pathetically,
                        âworn outâpoor fellow! We have something for him though,â pointing with his
                        forefinger over his shoulder to the saucepan that stood on the fire. âWe are
                        not cooksânot French cooks, not quite; but it's drinkable, drinkable, I
                        think; better than nothing, I think,â he added, nodding his head<pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7167-057"/> in a jocund manner that evinced his high
                        estimation of the contents of the saucepan and his profound satisfaction
                        therein. âBish! bish! my chicken,â he said, as Lyndall tapped her little
                        foot up and down upon the floor. âBish! bish! my chicken; you will wake
                        him.â</p>
                    <p>He moved the candle so that his own head might intervene between it and the
                        sleeper's face; and, smoothing his newspaper, he adjusted his spectacles to
                        read.</p>
                    <p>The child's grey-black eyes rested on the figure on the bed, then turned to
                        the German, then rested on the figure again.</p>
                    <p>â<emph>I</emph> think he is a liar. Good night, Uncle Otto,â she said slowly,
                        turning to the door.</p>
                    <p>Long after she had gone the German folded his paper up methodically, and put
                        it in his pocket.</p>
                    <p>The stranger had not awakened to partake of the soup, and his son had fallen
                        asleep on the ground. Taking two white sheep-skins from<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7167-058"/> the heap of sacks in the corner, the old man
                        doubled them up, and lifting the boy's head gently from the slate on which
                        it rested, placed the skins beneath it.</p>
                    <p>âPoor lambie, poor lambie!â he said, tenderly patting the great rough head;
                        âtired is he!â</p>
                    <p>He threw an overcoat across the boy's feet, and lifted the saucepan from the
                        fire. There was no place where the old man could comfortably lie down
                        himself, so he resumed his seat. Opening a much-worn Bible, he began to
                        read, and as he read pleasant thoughts and visions thronged on him.</p>
                    <p>âI was a stranger, and ye took me in,â he read.</p>
                    <p>He turned again to the bed where the sleeper lay.</p>
                    <p>âI was a stranger.â</p>
                    <p>Very tenderly the old man looked at him. He saw not the bloated body nor the
                        evil face of the man; but, as it were, under deep disguise<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7167-059"/> and fleshly concealment, the form that long years
                        of dreaming had made very real to him. âJesus, lover, and is it given to us,
                        weak and sinful, frail and erring, to serve <emph>Thee</emph>, to take
                            <emph>Thee</emph> in!â he said softly, as he rose from his seat. Full of
                        joy, he began to pace the little room. Now and again as he walked he sang
                        the lines of a German hymn, or muttered broken words of prayer. The little
                        room was full of light. It appeared to the German that Christ was very near
                        him, and that at almost any moment the thin mist of earthly darkness that
                        clouded his human eyes might be withdrawn, and that made manifest of which
                        the friends at Emmaus, beholding it, said, âIt is the Lord!â</p>
                    <p>Again, and yet again, through the long hours of that night, as the old man
                        walked he looked up to the roof of his little room, with its blackened
                        rafters, and yet saw them not. His rough, bearded face was illuminated with
                        a radiant gladness; and the night was not shorter<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7167-060"/> to the dreaming sleepers than to him whose waking
                        dreams brought heaven near.</p>
                    <p>So quickly the night fled, that he looked up with surprise when at four
                        o'clock the first grey streaks of summer dawn showed themselves through the
                        little window. Then the old man turned to rake together the few coals that
                        lay under the ashes, and his son, turning on the sheep-skins, muttered
                        sleepily to know if it were time to rise.</p>
                    <p>âLie still, lie still! I would only make a fire,â said the old man.</p>
                    <p>âHave you been up all night?â asked the boy.</p>
                    <p>âYes; but it has been short, very short. Sleep again, my chicken; it is yet
                        early.â</p>
                    <p>And he went out to fetch more fuel.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">BONAPARTE BLENKINS</hi> sat on the side of the bed. He had
                        wonderfully revived since the day before, held his head high, talked in a
                        full sonorous voice, and ate greedily of all the viands offered him. At his
                        side was a basin of soup, from which he took a deep draught now and again as
                        he watched the fingers of the German, who sat on the mud floor mending the
                        bottom of a chair.</p>
                    <p>Presently he looked out, where, in the afternoon sunshine, a few half-grown
                        ostriches might be seen wandering listlessly about, and then he looked in
                        again at the little white-washed room, and at Lyndall, who sat looking at a
                        book near<pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7167-062"/> the door. Then he raised his chin
                        and tried to adjust an imaginary shirt-collar. Finding none, he smoothed the
                        little grey fringe at the back of his head, and began,â</p>
                    <p>âYou are a student of history, I perceive, my friend, from the study of these
                        volumes that lie scattered about this apartment; this fact has been made
                        evident to me.â</p>
                    <p>âWellâa littleâperhapsâit may be,â said the German meekly.</p>
                    <p>âBeing a student of history then,â said Bonaparte, raising himself loftily,
                        âyou will doubtless have heard of my great, of my celebrated kinsman,
                        Napoleon Bonaparte?â</p>
                    <p>âYes, yes,â said the German, looking up.</p>
                    <p>âI, sir,â said Bonaparte, âwas born at this hour, on an April afternoon,
                        three-and-fifty years ago. The nurse, sirâshe was the same who attended when
                        the Duke of Sutherland was born,âbrought me to my mother. âThere is only one
                        name for this child,â she said: âhe has<pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7167-063"/> the
                        nose of his great kinsman;â and so Bonaparte Blenkins became my
                        nameâBonaparte Blenkins. Yes, sir,â said Bonaparte, âthere is a stream on
                            <emph>my</emph> maternal side that connects me with a stream on
                            <emph>his</emph> maternal side.â</p>
                    <p>The German made a sound of astonishment.</p>
                    <p>âThe connection,â said Bonaparte, âis one which could not be easily
                        comprehended by one unaccustomed to the study of aristocratic pedigrees; but
                        the connection is close.â</p>
                    <p>âIs it possible!â said the German, pausing in his work with much interest and
                        astonishment. âNapoleon an Irishman!â</p>
                    <p>âYes,â said Bonaparte, âon the mother's side, and that is how we are related.
                        There wasn't a man to beat him,â said Bonaparte, stretching himselfâânot a
                        man except the Duke of Wellington. And it's a strange coincidence,â added
                        Bonaparte, bending forward, âbut <emph>he</emph> was a connection of mine.
                        His nephew, the Duke of Wellington's nephew, married a cousin of<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7167-064"/> mine. <emph>She</emph> was a woman! See her at
                        one of the court ballsâamber-satinâdaisies in her hair. Worth going a
                        hundred miles to look at her! Often seen her there myself, sir!â</p>
                    <p>The German moved the leather thongs in and out, and thought of the strange
                        vicissitudes of human life, which might bring the kinsman of dukes and
                        emperors to his humble room.</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte appeared lost among old memories.</p>
                    <p>âAh, that Duke of Wellington's nephew!â he broke forth suddenly; âmany's the
                        joke I've had with him. Often came to visit me at Bonaparte Hall. Grand
                        place I had thenâpark, conservatory, servants. He had only one fault, that
                        Duke of Wellington's nephew,â said Bonaparte, observing that the German was
                        deeply interested in every word: âhe was a cowardâwhat you might call a
                        coward. You've never been in Russia, I suppose?â said Bonaparte, fixing his
                        crosswise-looking eyes on the German's face.</p>
                    <pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7167-065"/>
                    <p>âNo, no,â said the old man humbly. âFrance, England, Germany, a little in
                        this country; it is all I have travelled.â</p>
                    <p>â<emph>I</emph>, my friend,â said Bonaparte, âI have been in every country in
                        the world, and speak every civilized language, excepting only Dutch and
                        German. I wrote a book of my travelsânoteworthy incidents. Publisher got
                        itâcheated me out of it. Great rascals those publishers! Upon one occasion
                        the Duke of Wellington's nephew and I were travelling in Russia. All of a
                        sudden one of the horses dropped down dead as a doornail. There we wereâcold
                        nightâsnow four feet thickâgreat forestâone horse not being able to move the
                        sledgeânight coming onâwolves.</p>
                    <p>ââSpree!â says the Duke of Wellington's nephew.</p>
                    <p>ââSpree, do you call it?â says I. âLook out.â</p>
                    <p>âThere, sticking out under a bush, was nothing less than the nose of a bear.
                        The Duke<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7167-066"/> of Wellington's nephew was up a
                        tree like a shot; I stood quietly on the ground, as cool as I am at this
                        moment, loaded my gun, and climbed up the tree. There was only one
                        bough.</p>
                    <p>ââBon,â said the Duke of Wellington's nephew, âyou'd better sit in
                        front.â</p>
                    <p>ââAll right,â said I; âbut keep your gun ready. There are more coming.â He'd
                        got his face buried in my back.</p>
                    <p>ââHow many are there?â said he.</p>
                    <p>ââFour,â said I.</p>
                    <p>ââHow many are there now?â said he.</p>
                    <p>ââEight,â said I.</p>
                    <p>ââHow many are there now?â said he.</p>
                    <p>ââTen,â said I.</p>
                    <p>ââTen! ten!â said he; and down goes his gun.</p>
                    <p>ââWallie,â I said, âwhat have you done? We're dead men now!â</p>
                    <p>ââBon, my old fellow,â said he, âI couldn't help it; my hands trembled
                        so!â</p>
                    <pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7167-067"/>
                    <p>ââWall,â I said, turning round and seizing his hand, âWallie, my dear lad,
                        good-bye. I'm not afraid to die. My legs are longâthey hang downâthe first
                        bear that comes and I don't hit him, off goes my foot. When he takes it I
                        shall give you my gun and go. You may yet be saved; but tell, oh, tell
                        Mary-Ann that I thought of her, that I prayed for her.â</p>
                    <p>ââGood-bye, old fellow!â said he.</p>
                    <p>ââGod bless you!â said I.</p>
                    <p>âBy this time the bears were sitting in a circle all around the tree. Yes,â
                        said Bonaparte impressively, fixing his eyes on the German, âa regular,
                        exact, circle. The marks of their tails were left in the snow, and I
                        measured it afterward; a drawing-master couldn't have done it better. It was
                        that saved me. If they'd rushed on me at once, poor old Bon would never have
                        been here to tell this story. But they came on, sir, systematically, one by
                        one. All the rest sat on their tails and waited. The first fellow came<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7167-068"/> up, and I shot him; the second fellowâI
                        shot him; the thirdâI shot him. At last the tenth came; he was the biggest
                        of allâthe leader, you may say.</p>
                    <p>ââWal,â I said, âgive me your hand. My fingers are stiff with the cold; there
                        is only one bullet left. I shall miss him. While he is eating me you get
                        down and take your gun; and live, dear friend, live to remember the man who
                        gave his life for you!â By that time the bear was at me. I felt his paw on
                        my trousers.</p>
                    <p>ââOh, Bonnie! Bonnie!â said the Duke of Wellington's nephew. But I just took
                        my gun and put the muzzle to the bear's earâover he fellâdead!â</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte Blenkins waited to observe what effect his story had made. Then he
                        took out a dirty white handkerchief and stroked his forehead, and more
                        especially his eyes.</p>
                    <p>âIt always affects me to relate that adventure,â he remarked, returning the
                        handkerchief to his<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7167-069"/> pocket.
                        âIngratitudeâbase, vile ingratitudeâis recalled by it! That man, that man,
                        who but for me would have perished in the pathless wilds of Russia, that man
                        in the hour of my adversity forsook me. Yes,â said Bonaparte, âI had money,
                        I had lands; I said to my wife, âThere is Africa, a struggling country; they
                        want capital; they want men of talent; they want men of ability to open up
                        that land. Let us go.â</p>
                    <p>âI bought eight thousand pounds' worth of machineryâwinnowing, plowing,
                        reaping-machines; I loaded a ship with them. Next steamer I came outâwife,
                        children, all. Got to the Cape. Where is the ship with the things? Lostâgone
                        to the bottom! And the box with the money? Lostânothing saved!</p>
                    <p>âMy wife wrote to the Duke of Wellington's nephew; I didn't wish her to; she
                        did it without my knowledge.</p>
                    <pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7167-070"/>
                    <p>âWhat did the man whose life I saved do? Did he send me thirty thousand
                        pounds? say, âBonaparte, my brother, here is a crumb?â No; he sent me
                        nothing.</p>
                    <p>âMy wife said, âWrite.â I said, âMary Ann, NO. While these hands have power
                        to work, NO. While this frame has power to endure, NO. Never shall it be
                        said that Bonaparte Blenkins asked of any man.ââ</p>
                    <p>The man's noble independence touched the German.</p>
                    <p>âYour case is hard; yes, that <emph>is</emph> hard,â said the German, shaking
                        his head.</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte took another draught of the soup, leaned back against the pillows,
                        and sighed deeply.</p>
                    <p>âI think,â he said after a while, rousing himself, âI shall now wander in the
                        benign air, and taste the gentle cool of evening. The stiffness hovers over
                        me yet; exercise is beneficial.â</p>
                    <p>So saying, he adjusted his hat carefully on<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7167-071"/>
                        the bald crown of his head, and moved to the door. After he had gone the
                        German sighed again over his workâ</p>
                    <p>âAh, Lord! So it is! Ah!â</p>
                    <p>He thought of the ingratitude of the world.</p>
                    <p>âUncle Otto,â said the child in the doorway, âdid you ever hear of ten bears
                        sitting on their tails in a circle?â</p>
                    <p>âWell, not of ten exactly: but bears do attack travellers every day. It is
                        nothing unheard-of,â said the German. âA man of such courage too! Terrible
                        experience that!â</p>
                    <p>âAnd how do we know that the story is true, Uncle Otto?â</p>
                    <p>The German's ire was roused.</p>
                    <p>âThat is what I do hate!â he cried. âKnow that is true! How do you know that
                        anything is true? Because you are told so. If we begin to question
                        everything, wanting proof, proof, proof, what will we have to believe left?
                        How do you know the angel opened the prison-<pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7167-072"/> door for Peter, except that Peter said so? How do you know that God
                        talked to Moses, except that Moses wrote it? That is what I hate!â</p>
                    <p>The girl knit her brows. Perhaps her thoughts made a longer journey than the
                        German dreamed of; for, mark you, the old dream little how their words and
                        lives are texts and studies to the generation that shall succeed them. Not
                        what we are taught, but what we see, makes us, and the child gathers the
                        food on which the adult feeds to the end.</p>
                    <p>When the German looked up next there was a look of supreme satisfaction in
                        the little mouth and the beautiful eyes.</p>
                    <p>âWhat dost see, chicken?â he asked.</p>
                    <p>The child said nothing, and an agonizing shriek was borne on the afternoon
                        breeze.</p>
                    <p>âOh, God! my God! I am killed!â cried the voice of Bonaparte, as he, with
                        wide open mouth and shaking flesh, fell into the room, followed by<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7167-073"/> a half-grown ostrich, who put its head in at the
                        door, opened its beak at him, and went away.</p>
                    <p>âShut the door! shut the door! As you value my life, shut the door!â cried
                        Bonaparte, sinking into a chair, his face blue and white, with a
                        greenishness about the mouth. âAh, my friend,â he said tremulously,
                        âeternity has looked me in the face! My life's thread hung upon a cord! The
                        valley of the shadow of death!â said Bonaparte, seizing the German's
                        arm.</p>
                    <p>âDear, dear, dear!â said the German, who had closed the lower half of the
                        door, and stood much concerned beside the stranger, âyou have had a fright.
                        I never knew so young a bird to chase before; but they will take dislikes to
                        certain people. I sent a boy away once because a bird would chase him. Ah,
                        dear, dear!â</p>
                    <p>âWhen I looked round,â said Bonaparte, âthe red and yawning throat was above
                        me, and the reprehensible paw raised to strike me.<pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7167-074"/> My nerves,â said Bonaparte, suddenly growing
                        faint, âalways delicateâhighly strungâare brokenâbroken! You could not give
                        a little wine, a little brandy my friend?â</p>
                    <p>The old German hurried away to the bookshelf, and took from behind the books
                        a small bottle, half of whose contents he poured into a cup. Bonaparte
                        drained it eagerly.</p>
                    <p>âHow do you feel now?â asked the German, looking at him with much
                        sympathy.</p>
                    <p>âA little, <emph>slightly</emph>, better.â</p>
                    <p>The German went out to pick up the battered chimney-pot which had fallen
                        before the door.</p>
                    <p>âI am sorry you got the fright. The birds are bad things till you know them,â
                        he said kindly, as he put the hat down.</p>
                    <p>âMy friend,â said Bonaparte, holding out his hand, âI forgive you; do not be
                        disturbed. Whatever the consequences, I forgive you. I know, I believe, it
                        was with no ill-intent that<pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7167-075"/> you allowed me
                        to go out. Give me your hand. I have no ill-feeling.â</p>
                    <p>âYou are very kind,â said the German, taking the extended hand, and feeling
                        suddenly convinced that he was receiving magnanimous forgiveness for some
                        great injury, âyou are very kind.â</p>
                    <p>âDon't mention it,â said Bonaparte.</p>
                    <p>He knocked out the crown of his caved-in old hat, placed it on the table
                        before him, leaned his elbows on the table and his face in his hands, and
                        contemplated it.</p>
                    <p>âAh, my old friend,â he thus apostrophized the hat, âyou have served me long,
                        you have served me faithfully, but the last day has come. Never more shall
                        you be borne upon the head of your master. Never more shall you protect his
                        brow from the burning rays of summer or the cutting winds of winter.
                        Henceforth bare-headed must your master go. Good-bye, good-bye, old
                        hat!â</p>
                    <pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7167-076"/>
                    <p>At the end of this affecting appeal the German rose. He went to the box at
                        the foot of his bed; out of it he took a black hat, which had evidently been
                        seldom worn and carefully preserved.</p>
                    <p>âIt's not exactly what you may have been accustomed to,â he said nervously,
                        putting it down beside the battered chimney-pot, âbut it might be of some
                        useâa protection to the head, you know.â</p>
                    <p>âMy friend,â said Bonaparte, âyou are not following my advice; you are
                        allowing yourself to be reproached on my account. Do not make yourself
                        unhappy. No; I shall go bare-headed.â</p>
                    <p>âNo, no, no!â cried the German energetically. âI have no use for the hat,
                        none at all. It is shut up in the box.â</p>
                    <p>âThen I will take it, my friend. It is a comfort to one's own mind when you
                        have unintentionally injured any one to make reparation. I know the feeling.
                        The hat may not<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7167-077"/> be of that refined cut of
                        which the old one was, but it will serve, yes, it will serve. Thank you,â
                        said Bonaparte, adjusting it on his head, and then replacing it on the
                        table. âI shall lie down now and take a little repose,â he added; âI much
                        fear my appetite for supper will be lost.â</p>
                    <p>âI hope not, I hope not,â said the German, reseating himself at his work, and
                        looking much concerned as Bonaparte stretched himself on the bed and turned
                        the end of the patchwork quilt over his feet.</p>
                    <p>âYou must not think to make your departure not for many days,â said the
                        German presently. âTant' Sannie gives her consent, andââ</p>
                    <p>âMy friend,â said Bonaparte, closing his eyes sadly, âyou are kind; but were
                        it not that to-morrow is the Sabbath, weak and trembling as I lie here, I
                        would proceed on my way. I must seek work; idleness but for a day is<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7167-078"/> painful. <emph>Work, labour</emph>âthat is
                        the secret of all true happiness!â</p>
                    <p>He doubled the pillow under his head, and watched how the German drew the
                        leather thongs in and out.</p>
                    <p>After a while Lyndall silently put her book on the shelf and went home, and
                        the German stood up and began to mix some water and meal for roaster-cakes.
                        As he stirred them with his hands he said,â</p>
                    <p>âI make always a double supply on Saturday night; the hands are then free as
                        the thoughts for Sunday.â</p>
                    <p>âThe blessed Sabbath,â said Bonaparte.</p>
                    <p>There was a pause. Bonaparte twisted his eyes without moving his head, to see
                        if supper were already on the fire.</p>
                    <p>âYou must sorely miss the administration of the Lord's word in this desolate
                        spot,â added Bonaparte. âOh, how love I Thine house, and the place where
                        Thine honour dwelleth!â</p>
                    <pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7167-079"/>
                    <p>âWell, we do; yes,â said the German; âbut we do our best. We meet together,
                        and Iâwell, I say a few words, and perhaps they are not wholly lost, not
                        quite.â</p>
                    <p>âStrange coincidence,â said Bonaparte; âmy plan always was the same. Was in
                        the Free State onceâsolitary farmâone neighbour. Every Sunday I called
                        together friend and neighbour, child and servant, and said, âRejoice with
                        me, that we may serve the Lord,â and then I addressed them. Ah, those were
                        blessed times,â said Bonaparte; âwould they might return.â</p>
                    <p>The German stirred at the cakes, and stirred, and stirred, and stirred. He
                        could give the stranger his bed, and he could give the stranger his hat, and
                        he could give the stranger his brandy; but his Sunday service!</p>
                    <p>After a good while he said,</p>
                    <p>âI might speak to Tant' Sannie; I might<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7167-080"/>
                        arrange; you might take the service in my place, if itââ</p>
                    <p>âMy friend,â said Bonaparte, âit would give me the profoundest felicity, the
                        most unbounded satisfaction; but in these worn-out habiliments, in these
                        deteriorated garments, it would not be possible, it would not be fitting
                        that I should officiate in service of One whom, for respect, we shall not
                        name. No, my friend, I will remain here; and, while you are assembling
                        yourselves together in the presence of the Lord, I, in my solitude, will
                        think of and pray for you. No; I will remain here!â</p>
                    <p>It was a touching pictureâthe solitary man there praying for them. The German
                        cleared his hands from the meal, and went to the chest from which he had
                        taken the black hat. After a little careful feeling about, he produced a
                        black cloth coat, trowsers, and waistcoat, which he laid on the table,
                        smiling knowingly. They<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7167-081"/> were of new shining
                        cloth, worn twice a year, when he went to the town to ânachtmaal.â He looked
                        with great pride at the coat as he unfolded it and held it up.</p>
                    <p>âIt's not the latest fashion, perhaps, not a West End cut, not exactly; but
                        it might do; it might serve at a push. Try it on, try it on!â he said, his
                        old grey eyes twinkling with pride.</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte stood up and tried on the coat. It fitted admirably; the waistcoat
                        could be made to button by ripping up the back, and the trowsers were
                        perfect; but below were the ragged boots. The German was not disconcerted.
                        Going to the beam where a pair of top-boots hung, he took them off, dusted
                        them carefully, and put them down before Bonaparte. The old eyes now fairly
                        brimmed over with sparkling enjoyment.</p>
                    <p>âI have only worn them once. They might serve; they might be endured.â</p>
                    <pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7167-082"/>
                    <p>Bonaparte drew them on and stood upright, his head almost touching the beams.
                        The German looked at him with profound admiration. It was wonderful what a
                        difference feathers made in the bird.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="b">THE</hi> boy Waldo kissed the pages of his book and looked
                            up. Far over the flat lay the âkopje,â a mere speck; the sheep wandered
                            quietly from bush to bush; the stillness of the early Sunday rested
                            everywhere, and the air was fresh.</p>
                        <p>He looked down at his book. On its page a black insect crept. He lifted
                            it off with his finger. Then he leaned on his elbow, watching its
                            quivering antennÃ¦ and strange movements, smiling.</p>
                        <p>âEven you,â he whispered, âshall not die. Even you He loves. Even you He
                            will enfold<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7167-084"/> in His arms when He takes
                            everything and makes it perfect and happy.â</p>
                        <p>When the thing had gone he smoothed the leaves of his Bible somewhat
                            caressingly. The leaves of that book had dropped blood for him once;
                            they had taken the brightness out of his childhood; from between them
                            had sprung the visions that had clung about him and made night horrible.
                            Adder-like thoughts had lifted their heads, had shot out forked tongues
                            at him, asking mockingly strange, trivial questions that he could not
                            answer, miserable child:â</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi>Why did the women in Mark see only <emph>one</emph> angel and the
                                women in Luke <emph>two</emph>? Could a story be told in opposite
                                ways and both ways be true? Could it? could it? <emph>Then
                                    again:</emph> Is there nothing always right, and nothing always
                                wrong? Could Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite âput her hand to the
                                nail, and her right hand to the workman's hammer?â and could the
                                Spirit of the Lord chant pÃ¦ans over her, loud pÃ¦ans, high pÃ¦ans, set
                                in the</hi>
                            <pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7167-085"/>
                            <hi>book of the Lord, and no voice cry out it was a mean and dastardly
                                sin to lie, and kill the trusting in their sleep? Could the friend
                                of God marry his own sister, and be beloved, and the man who does it
                                to-day goes to hell, to hell? Was there nothing always right or
                                always wrong?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Those leaves had dropped blood for him once: they had made his heart
                            heavy and cold; they had robbed his childhood of its gladness; now his
                            fingers moved over them caressingly.</p>
                        <p>âMy father God knows, my father knows,â he said; âwe cannot understand;
                            He knows.â After a while he whisperedââI heard your voice this morning
                            when my eyes were not yet open, I felt you near me, my Father. Why do
                            you love me so? How is it in the last four months all those old
                            questions have gone from me? I know you are good; I know you love
                            everything; I know it is all right; I <emph>feel</emph> it. I could not
                            have borne it any more, not any more. I was almost mad. And all the
                                while<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7167-086"/> I was so miserable you were
                            looking at me and loving me, and I never knew it. But I know it now. I
                                <emph>feel</emph> it,â said the boy, and he laughed low; âI
                                <emph>feel</emph> it!â he laughed.</p>
                        <p>After a while he began partly to sing, partly to chant the disconnected
                            verses of hymns, those which spoke his gladness, many times over, and
                            loudly and always louder. The sheep with their senseless eyes turned to
                            look at him as he sang.</p>
                        <p>At last he lapsed into quiet. Then as the boy lay there, staring at bush
                            and sand, he saw a vision.</p>
                        <p>He had crossed the river of Death, and walked on the other bank in the
                            Lord's land of Beulah. His feet sank into the dark grass, and he walked
                            alone. Then, far over the fields, he saw a figure coming across the dark
                            green grass. At first he thought it must be one of the angels; but as it
                            came nearer he began to feel what it was. And it came closer, closer<pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7167-087"/> to him, and then the voice said,
                            âCome,â and he knew surely Who it was. He ran to the dear feet and
                            touched them with his hands; yes, he held them fast! He lay down beside
                            them. When he looked up the face was over him, and the glorious eyes
                            were loving him; and they two were there alone together.</p>
                        <p>He laughed a deep laugh; then started up like one suddenly awakened from
                            sleep.</p>
                        <p>âOh, God!â he cried, âI cannot wait; I cannot wait! I want to die; I want
                            to see Him; I want to touch him. Let me die!â He folded his hands,
                            trembling. âHow can I wait so longâfor long, long years perhaps? I want
                            to dieâto see Him. I will die any death. Oh, let me come!â</p>
                        <p>Weeping he bowed himself, and quivered from head to foot. After a long
                            while he lifted his head.</p>
                        <p>âYes; I will wait; I will wait. But not long; do not let it be very long,
                            Jesus. I want you;<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7167-088"/> oh, I want youâsoon,
                            soon!â He sat still, staring across the plain with his tearful eyes.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="b">IN</hi> the front room of the farmhouse sat Tant' Sannie in
                            her elbow-chair. In her hand was her great brass-clasped hymn-book,
                            round her neck was a clean white handkerchief, under her feet was a
                            wooden stove. There too sat Em and Lyndall, in clean pinafores and new
                            shoes. There too was the spruce Hottentot in a starched white âcappje,â
                            and her husband on the other side of the door, with his wool oiled and
                            very much combed out, and staring at his new leather boots. The Kaffir
                            servants were not there because Tant' Sannie held they were descended
                            from apes, and needed no salvation. But the rest were gathered for the
                            Sunday service, and waited the officiator.</p>

                        <p>Meanwhile Bonaparte and the German approached arm in armâBonaparte
                            resplendent in the black cloth clothes, a spotless shirt, and a spotless
                            collar; the German in the old salt-and-pepper, casting shy glances of
                            admiration at his companion.</p>
                        <p>At the front door Bonaparte removed his hat with much dignity, raised his
                            shirt collar, and entered. To the centre table he walked, put his hat
                            solemnly down by the big Bible, and bowed his head over it in silent
                            prayer.</p>
                        <p>The Boer-woman looked at the Hottentot, and the Hottentot looked at the
                            Boer-woman.</p>
                        <p>There was one thing on earth for which Tant' Sannie had a profound
                            reverence, which exercised a subduing influence over her, which made her
                            for the time a better womanâthat thing was new, shining black cloth. It
                            made her think of the âpredikant;â it made her think of the elders who
                            sat in the top pew of the church on Sundays, with the hair so nicely
                            oiled, so holy<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7167-090"/> and respectable, with
                            their little swallow-tailed coats; it made her think of heaven, where
                            everything was so holy and respectable, and nobody wore tan-cord, and
                            the littlest angel had a black tail-coat. She wished she hadn't called
                            him a thief and a Roman Catholic. She hoped the German hadn't told him.
                            She wondered where those clothes were when he came in rags to her door.
                            There was no doubt, he was a very respectable man, a gentleman.</p>
                        <p>The German began to read a hymn. At the end of each line Bonaparte
                            groaned, and twice at the end of every verse.</p>
                        <p>The Boer-woman had often heard of persons groaning during prayers, to add
                            a certain poignancy and finish to them; she would have looked upon it as
                            no especial sign of grace in any one; but to groan at hymn-time! She was
                            startled. She wondered if he remembered that she shook her fist in his
                            face. This was a man of God. They knelt down to pray. The Boer-woman<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7167-091"/> weighed two hundred and fifty pounds,
                            and could not kneel. She sat in her chair, and peeped between her
                            crossed fingers at the stranger's back. She could not understand what he
                            said; but he was in earnest. He shook the chair by the back rail till it
                            made quite a little dust on the mud floor.</p>
                        <p>When they rose from their knees Bonaparte solemnly seated himself in the
                            chair and opened the Bible. He blew his nose, pulled up his shirt
                            collar, smoothed the leaves, stroked down his capacious waistcoat, blew
                            his nose again, looked solemnly round the room, then began,â</p>
                        <p>âAll liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and
                            brimstone, which is the second death.â</p>
                        <p>Having read this portion of Scripture, Bonaparte paused impressively, and
                            looked all round the room.</p>
                        <p>âI shall not, my dear friends,â he said, âlong detain you. Much of our
                            precious time has<pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7167-092"/> already fled
                            blissfully from us in the voice of thanksgiving and the tongue of
                            praise. A few, a very few words are all I shall address to you, and may
                            they be as a rod of iron dividing the bones from the marrow, and the
                            marrow from the bones.</p>
                        <p>âIn the first place: What is a liar?â</p>
                        <p>The question was put so pointedly, and followed by a pause so profound,
                            that even the Hottentot man left off looking at his boots and opened his
                            eyes, though he understood not a word.</p>
                        <p>âI repeat,â said Bonaparte, âwhat is a liar?â</p>
                        <p>The sensation was intense; the attention of the audience was riveted.</p>
                        <p>âHave you any of you ever seen a liar, my dear friends?â There was a
                            still longer pause. âI hope not; I truly hope not. But I will tell you
                            what a liar is. I knew a liar onceâa little boy who lived in Cape Town,
                            in Short Market<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7167-093"/> Street. His mother and
                            I sat together one day, discoursing about our souls.</p>
                        <p>ââHere, Sampson,â said his mother, âgo and buy sixpence of âmeibossâ from
                            the Malay round the corner.â</p>
                        <p>âWhen he came back she said: âHow much have you got?â</p>
                        <p>ââFive,â he said.</p>
                        <p>âHe was afraid if he said six and a half she'd ask for some. And, my
                            friends, that was a lie. The half of a âmeibossâ stuck in his throat and
                            he died and was buried. And where did the soul of that little liar go
                            to, my friends? It went to the lake of fire and brimstone. This brings
                            me to the second point of my discourse.</p>
                        <p>âWhat is a lake of fire and brimstone? I will tell you, my friends,â said
                            Bonaparte condescendingly. âThe imagination unaided cannot conceive it:
                            but by the help of the Lord I will put it before your mind's eye.</p>
                        <p>âI was travelling in Italy once on a time;<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7167-094"/> I came to a city called Rome, a vast city, and near it is a mountain
                            which spits forth fire. Its name is Etna. Now, there was a man in that
                            city of Rome who had not the fear of God before his eyes, and he loved a
                            woman. The woman died, and he walked up that mountain spitting fire, and
                            when he got to the top, he threw himself in at the hole that is there.
                            The next day I went up. I was not afraid; the Lord preserves His
                            servants. And in their hands shall they bear thee up, lest at any time
                            thou fall into a volcano. It was dark night when I got there, but in the
                            fear of the Lord I walked to the edge of the yawning abyss, and looked
                            in. That sightâthat sight, my friends, is impressed upon my most
                            indelible memory. I looked down into the lurid depths upon an
                            incandescent lake, a melted fire, a seething sea; the billows rolled
                            from side to side, and on their fiery crests tossed the white skeleton
                            of the suicide. The heat had burnt the flesh from off<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7167-095"/> the bones; they lay as a light cork upon the
                            melted, fiery waves. One skeleton hand was raised upward, the finger
                            pointing to heaven; the other, with outstretched finger, pointing
                            downward, as though it would say, âI go below, but you, Bonaparte, may
                            soar above.â I gazed; I stood entranced. At that instant there was a
                            crack in the lurid lake; it swelled, expanded, and the skeleton of the
                            suicide disappeared, to be seen no more by mortal eye.â</p>
                        <p>Here again Bonaparte rested, and then continuedâ</p>
                        <p>âThe lake of melted stone rose in the crater, it swelled higher and
                            higher at the side, it streamed forth at the top. I had presence of
                            mind; near me was a rock; I stood upon it. The fiery torrent was vomited
                            out and streamed on either side of me. And through that long and
                            terrible night I stood there alone upon that rock, the glowing, fiery
                            lava on every handâa monument of the long-suffering and tender
                            providence of<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7167-096"/> the Lord, who spared me
                            that I might this day testify in your ears of Him.</p>
                        <p>âNow, my dear friends, let us deduce the lessons that are to be learnt
                            from this narrative.</p>
                        <p>âFirstly: let us never commit suicide. The man is a fool, my friends,
                            that man is insane, my friends, who would leave this earth, my friends.
                            Here are joys innumerable, such as it hath not entered into the heart of
                            man to understand, my friends. Here are clothes, my friends; here are
                            beds, my friends; here is delicious food, my friends. Our precious
                            bodies were given us to love, to cherish. Oh, let us do so! Oh, let us
                            never hurt them; but care for and love them, my friends!â</p>
                        <p>Every one was impressed, and Bonaparte proceeded.</p>
                        <p>âThirdly; let us not love too much. If that young man had not loved that
                            young woman, he would not have jumped into Mount Etna. The good men of
                            old never did so. Was Jeremiah<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7167-097"/> ever in
                            love, or Ezekiel, or Hosea, or even any of the minor prophets? No. Then
                            why should we be? Thousands are rolling in that lake at this moment who
                            would say, âIt was love that brought us here.â Oh, let us think always
                            of our own souls first.</p>
                        <q>
                            <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                                <l>ââA charge to keep I have,</l>

                                <l>A never-dying soul to save,</l>

                        </q>
                        <p>âOh, beloved friends, remember the little boy and the âmeibossâ; remember
                            the young girl and the young man; remember the lake, the fire, and the
                            brimstone; remember the suicide's skeleton on the pitchy billows of
                            Mount Etna; remember the voice of warning that has this day sounded in
                            your ears; and what I say to you I say to allâwatch! May the Lord add
                            his blessings!â</p>
                        <p>Here the Bible closed with a tremendous thud. Tant' Sannie loosened the
                            white handkerchief<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7167-098"/> about her neck and
                            wiped her eyes, and the coloured girl, seeing her do so, sniffled. The
                            did not understand the discourse, which made it the more affecting.
                            There hung over it that inscrutable charm which hovers forever for the
                            human intellect, over the incomprehensible and shadowy. When the last
                            hymn was sung the German conducted the officiator to Tant' Sannie, who
                            graciously extended her hand, and offered coffee and a seat on the sofa.
                            Leaving him there, the German hurried away to see how the little
                            plum-pudding he had left at home was advancing; and Tant' Sannie
                            remarked that it was a hot day. Bonaparte gathered her meaning as she
                            fanned herself with the end of her apron. He bowed low in acquiescence.
                            A long silence followed. Tant' Sannie spoke again. Bonaparte gave her no
                            ear; his eye was fixed on a small miniature on the opposite wall, which
                            represented Tant' Sannie as she had appeared on the day before her
                                confirmation,<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7167-099"/> fifteen years before,
                            attired in green muslin. Suddenly he started to his feet, walked up to
                            the picture, and took his stand before it. Long and wistfully he gazed
                            into its features; it was easy to see that he was deeply moved. With a
                            sudden movement, as though no longer able to restrain himself, he seized
                            the picture, loosened it from its nail, and held it close to his eyes.
                            At length, turning to the Boer-woman, he said, in a voice of deep
                            emotion,â</p>
                        <p>âYou will, I trust, dear madam, excuse this exhibition of my feelings;
                            but thisâthis little picture recalls to me my first and best beloved, my
                            dear departed wife, who is now a saint in heaven.â</p>
                        <p>Tant' Sannie could not understand; but the Hottentot maid, who had taken
                            her seat on the floor beside her mistress, translated the English into
                            Dutch as far as she was able.</p>
                        <p>âAh, my first, my beloved!â he added, looking tenderly down at the
                            picture. âOh,<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7167-100"/> the beloved, the
                            beautiful lineaments! My angel wife! This is surely a sister of yours,
                            madame?â he added, fixing his eyes on Tant' Sannie.</p>
                        <p>The Dutchwoman blushed, shook her head, and pointed to herself.</p>
                        <p>Carefully, intently, Bonaparte looked from the picture in his hand to
                            Tant' Sannie's features, and from the features back to the picture. Then
                            slowly a light broke over his countenance, he looked up, it became a
                            smile; he looked back at the miniature, his whole countenance was
                            effulgent.</p>
                        <p>âAh, yes; I see it now,â he cried, turning his delighted gaze on the
                            Boer-woman; âeyes, mouth, nose, chin, the very expression!â he cried.
                            âHow is it possible I did not notice it before?â</p>
                        <p>âTake another cup of coffee,â said Tant' Sannie. âPut some sugar in.â</p>
                        <p>Bonaparte hung the picture tenderly up, and<pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7167-101"/> was turning to take the cup from her hand,
                            when the German appeared, to say that the pudding was ready and the meat
                            on the table.</p>
                        <p>âHe's a God-fearing man, and one who knows how to behave himself,â said
                            the Boer-woman as he went out at the door. âIf he's ugly, did not the
                            Lord make him? And are we to laugh at the Lord's handiwork? It is better
                            to be ugly and good than pretty and bad; though of course it's nice when
                            one is both,â said Tant' Sannie, looking complacently at the picture on
                            the wall.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon the German and Bonaparte sat before the door of the
                            cabin. Both smoked in complete silenceâBonaparte with a book in his
                            hands and his eyes half closed; the German puffing vigorously, and
                            glancing up now and again at the serene blue sky overhead.</p>
                        <p>âSupposingâyouâyou, in fact, made the<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7167-102"/>
                            remark to me,â burst forth the German suddenly, âthat you were looking
                            for a situation.â</p>
                        <p>Bonaparte opened his mouth wide, and sent a stream of smoke through his
                            lips.</p>
                        <p>âNow supposing,â said the Germanââmerely supposing, of courseâthat some
                            one, some one, in fact, should make an offer to you, say, to become
                            schoolmaster on their farm and teach two children, two little girls,
                            perhaps, and would give you forty pounds a-year, would you accept
                            it?âJust supposing, of course.â</p>
                        <p>âWell, my dear friend,â said Bonaparte, âthat would depend on
                            circumstances. Money is no consideration with me. For my wife I have
                            made provision for the next year. My health is broken. Could I meet a
                            place where a gentleman would be treated as a gentleman I would accept
                            it, however small the remuneration. With me,â said Bonaparte, âmoney is
                            no consideration.â</p>
                        <p>âWell,â said the German, when he had taken<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7167-103"/> a whiff or two more from his pipe, âI think I
                            shall go up and see Tant' Sannie a little. I go up often on Sunday
                            afternoon to have a general conversation, to see her, you know.
                            Nothingânothing particular, you know.â</p>
                        <p>The old man put his book into his pocket, and walked up to the farmhouse
                            with a peculiarly knowing and delighted expression of countenance.</p>
                        <p>âHe doesn't suspect what I'm going to do,â soliloquized the German;
                            âhasn't the least idea. A nice surprise for him.â</p>
                        <p>The man whom he had left at his doorway winked at the retreating figure
                            with a wink that was quite indescribable.</p>

                    <head type="sub">BONAPARTE BLENKINS MAKES HIS NEST.</head>
                    <p>â<hi rend="b">AH</hi>, what is the matter?â asked Waldo, stopping at the foot
                        of the ladder with a load of skins on his back that he was carrying up to
                        the loft. Through the open door in the gable little Em was visible, her feet
                        dangling from the high bench on which she sat. The room, once a store-room,
                        had been divided by a row of âmealieâ bags into two partsâthe back being
                        Bonaparte's bedroom, the front his school-room.</p>
                    <p>âLyndall made him angry,â said the girl tearfully; âand he has given me the
                        fourteenth of John to learn. He says he will teach me to behave myself when
                        Lyndall troubles him.â</p>
                    <p>âWhat did she do?â asked the boy.</p>
                    <pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7167-105"/>
                    <p>âYou see,â said Em, hopelessly turning the leaves, âwhenever he talks she
                        looks out at the door, as though she did not hear him. To-day she asked him
                        what the signs of the Zodiac were, and he said he was surprised that she
                        should ask him; it was not a fit and proper thing for little girls to talk
                        about. Then she asked him who Copernicus was; and he said he was one of the
                        Emperors of Rome, who burned the Christians in a golden pig, and the worms
                        ate him up while he was still alive. I don't know why,â said Em plaintively,
                        âbut she just put her books under her arm, and walked out; and she will
                        never come to his school again, she says, and she <emph>always</emph> does
                        what she says. And now I must sit here every day alone,â said Em, the great
                        tears dropping softly.</p>
                    <p>âPerhaps Tant' Sannie will send him away,â said the boy, in his mumbling way,
                        trying to comfort her.</p>
                    <p>âNo,â said Em, shaking her head; âno.<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7167-106"/> Last
                        night, when the little Hottentot maid was washing her feet, he told her he
                        liked such feet, and that fat women were so nice to him; and she said, I
                        must always put him pure cream in his coffee now. No; he'll never go away,â
                        said Em dolorously.</p>
                    <p>The boy put down his skins and fumbled in his pocket, and produced a small
                        piece of paper containing something. He stuck it out toward her.</p>
                    <p>âThere, take it for you,â he said. This was by way of comfort.</p>
                    <p>Em opened it and found a small bit of gum; but the great tears dropped down
                        slowly on to it.</p>
                    <p>Waldo was distressed. He had cried so much in his morsel of life that tears
                        in another seemed to burn him.</p>
                    <p>âIf,â he said, stepping in awkwardly and standing by the table, âif you will
                        not cry I will tell you somethingâa secret.â</p>
                    <pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7167-107"/>
                    <p>âWhat is that?â asked Em, instantly becoming decidedly better.</p>
                    <p>âYou will tell it to no human being?â</p>
                    <p>âNo.â</p>
                    <p>He bent nearer to her, and with deep solemnity said,â</p>
                    <p>â<emph>I have made a machine!</emph>â</p>
                    <p>The girl opened her eyes.</p>
                    <p>âYes; a machine for shearing sheep. It is almost done,â said the boy. âThere
                        is only one thing that is not right yet; but it will be soon. When you
                        think, and think, and think, all night and all day, it comes at last,â he
                        added mysteriously.</p>
                    <p>âWhere is it?â</p>
                    <p>âHere! I always carry it here,â said the boy, putting his hand to his breast,
                        where a bulging-out was visible. âThis is a model. When it is done they will
                        have to make a large one.â</p>
                    <p>âShow it me.â</p>
                    <pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7167-108"/>
                    <p>The boy shook his head.</p>
                    <p>âNo, not till it is done. I cannot let any human being see it till then.â</p>
                    <p>âIt is a beautiful secret,â said Em; and the boy shuffled out to pick up his
                        skins.</p>
                    <p>That evening father and son sat in the cabin eating their supper. The father
                        sighed deeply sometimes. Perhaps he thought how long a time it was since
                        Bonaparte had visited the cabin; but his son was in that land in which sighs
                        have no part. It is a question whether it were not better to be the
                        shabbiest of fools, and know the way up the little stair of imagination to
                        the land of dreams, than the wisest of men, who see nothing that the eyes do
                        not show, and feel nothing that the hands do not touch. The boy chewed his
                        brown bread and drank his coffee; but in truth he saw only his machine
                        finishedâthat last something found out and added. He saw it as it worked
                        with beautiful smoothness; and over and above, as he chewed<pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7167-109"/> his bread and drank his coffee, there was that
                        delightful consciousness of something bending over him and loving him. It
                        would not have been better in one of the courts of heaven, where the walls
                        are set with rows of the King of Glory's amethysts and milk-white pearls,
                        than there, eating his supper in that little room.</p>
                    <p>As they sat in silence there was a knock at the door. When it was opened the
                        small woolly head of a little nigger showed itself. She was a messenger from
                        Tant' Sannie: the German was wanted at once at the homestead. Putting on his
                        hat with both hands, he hurried off. The kitchen was in darkness, but in the
                        pantry beyond, Tant' Sannie and her maids were assembled.</p>
                    <p>A Kaffir girl, who had been grinding pepper between two stones, knelt on the
                        floor, the lean Hottentot stood with a brass candlestick in her hand, and
                        Tant' Sannie, near the shelf, with a<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7167-110"/> hand
                        on each hip, was evidently listening intently, as were her companions.</p>
                    <p>âWhat may it be?â cried the old German in astonishment.</p>
                    <p>The room beyond the pantry was the store-room. Through the thin wooden
                        partition there arose at that instant, evidently from some creature
                        ensconced there, a prolonged and prodigious howl, followed by a succession
                        of violent blows against the partition wall.</p>
                    <p>The German seized the churn-stick, and was about to rush round the house,
                        when the Boer-woman impressively laid her hand upon his arm.</p>
                    <p>âThat is his head,â said Tant' Sannie, âthat is his head.â</p>
                    <p>âBut what might it be?â asked the German, looking from one to the other,
                        churn-stick in hand.</p>
                    <p>A low hollow bellow prevented reply, and the voice of Bonaparte lifted itself
                        on high.</p>
                    <p>âMary-Ann! my angel! my wife!â</p>
                    <pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7167-111"/>
                    <p>âIsn't it dreadful?â said Tant' Sannie, as the blows were repeated fiercely.
                        âHe has got a letter: his wife is dead. You must go and comfort him,â said
                        Tant' Sannie at last, âand I will go with you. It would not be the thing for
                        me to go aloneâme, who am only thirty-three, and he an unmarried man now,â
                        said Tant' Sannie, blushing and smoothing out her apron.</p>
                    <p>Upon this they all trudged round the house in companyâthe Hottentot maid
                        carrying the light, Tant' Sannie and the German following, and the Kaffir
                        girl bringing up the rear.</p>
                    <p>âOh,â said Tant' Sannie, âI see now it wasn't wickedness made him do without
                        his wife so longâonly necessity.â</p>
                    <p>At the door she motioned to the German to enter, and followed him closely. On
                        the stretcher behind the sacks Bonaparte lay on his face, his head pressed
                        into a pillow, his legs kicking gently. The Boer-woman sat down on a box
                            at<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7167-112"/> the foot of the bed. The German
                        stood with folded hands looking on.</p>
                    <p>âWe must all die,â said Tant' Sannie at last; âit is the dear Lord's
                        will.â</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte, hearing her voice, turned himself on to his back.</p>
                    <p>âIt's very hard,â said Tant' Sannie, âI know, for I've lost two
                        husbands.â</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte looked up into the German's face.</p>
                    <p>âOh, what does she say? Speak to me words of comfort!â</p>
                    <p>The German repeated Tant' Sannie's remark.</p>
                    <p>âAh, IâI also! Two dear, dear wives, whom I shall never see any more!â cried
                        Bonaparte, flinging himself back upon the bed.</p>
                    <p>He howled till the tarantulas, who lived between the rafters and the zinc
                        roof, felt the unusual vibration, and looked out with their wicked bright
                        eyes, to see what was going on.</p>
                    <p>Tant' Sannie sighed, the Hottentot maid sighed, the Kaffir girl who looked in
                        at the<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7167-113"/> door put her hand over her mouth
                        and said âMowâwah!â</p>
                    <p>âYou must trust in the Lord,â said Tant' Sannie. âHe can give you more than
                        you have lost.â</p>
                    <p>âI do, I do!â he cried; âbut oh, I have no wife! I have no wife!â</p>
                    <p>Tant' Sannie was much affected, and came and stood near the bed.</p>
                    <p>âAsk him if he won't have a little papânice, fine, flour pap. There is some
                        boiling on the kitchen fire.â</p>
                    <p>The German made the proposal; but the widower waved his hand.</p>
                    <p>âNo, nothing shall pass my lips. I should be suffocated. No, no! Speak not of
                        food to me!â</p>
                    <p>âPap, and a little brandy in,â said Tant' Sannie coaxingly.</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte caught the word.</p>
                    <p>âPerhaps, perhapsâif I struggled with myself<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7167-114"/> âfor the sake of my duties I might imbibe a few drops,â he said, looking
                        with quivering lip up into the German's face. âI must do my duty, must I
                        not?â</p>
                    <p>Tant' Sannie gave the order, and the girl went for the pap.</p>
                    <p>âI know how it was when my first husband died. They could do nothing with
                        me,â the Boer-woman said, âtill I had eaten a sheep's trotter and honey, and
                        a little roaster-cake. <emph>I</emph> know.â</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte sat up on the bed with his legs stretched out in front of him, and
                        a hand on each knee, blubbering softly.</p>
                    <p>âOh, she was a woman! You are very kind to try and comfort me, but she was my
                        wife. For a woman that is my wife I could live; for the woman that is my
                        wife I could die! For a woman that is my wife I couldâ Ah! that sweet word
                            <hi>wife</hi>; when will it rest upon my lips again?â</p>
                    <pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7167-115"/>
                    <p>When his feelings had subsided a little he raised the corners of his
                        turned-down mouth, and spoke to the German with flabby lips.</p>
                    <p>âDo you think she understands me? Oh, tell her every word, that she may know
                        I thank her.â</p>
                    <p>At that instant the girl reappeared with a basin of steaming gruel and a
                        black bottle.</p>
                    <p>Tant' Sannie poured some of its contents into the basin, stirred it well, and
                        came to the bed.</p>
                    <p>âOh, I can't, I can't! I shall die! I shall die!â said Bonaparte, putting his
                        hands to his side.</p>
                    <p>âCome, just a little,â said Tant' Sannie coaxingly; âjust a drop.â</p>
                    <p>âIt's too thick, it's too thick. I should choke.â</p>
                    <p>Tant' Sannie added something from the bottle and held out a spoonful;
                        Bonaparte opened his mouth like a little bird waiting for a worm, and<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7167-116"/> held it open, as she dipped again and
                        again into the pap.</p>
                    <p>âAh, this will do your heart good,â said Tant' Sannie, in whose mind the
                        relative functions of heart and stomach were exceedingly ill-defined.</p>
                    <p>When the basin was emptied the violence of his grief was much assuaged; he
                        looked at Tant' Sannie with gentle tears.</p>
                    <p>âTell him,â said the Boer-woman, âthat I hope he will sleep well, and that
                        the Lord will comfort him, as the Lord only can.â</p>
                    <p>âBless you, dear friend, God bless you,â said Bonaparte.</p>
                    <p>When the door was safely shut he got off the bed and washed away the soap he
                        had rubbed on his eyelids.</p>
                    <p>âBon,â he said, slapping his leg, âyou're the 'cutest lad I ever came across.
                        If you don't turn out the old Hymns-and-prayers, and pummel the Ragged-coat,
                        and get your arms round the<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7167-117"/> fat one's
                        waist and a wedding-ring on her finger, then you are not Bonaparte. But you
                            <emph>are</emph> Bonaparte. Bon, you're a fine boy!â</p>
                    <p>Making which pleasing reflection, he pulled off his trousers and got into bed
                        cheerfully.</p>

                    <head type="sub">HE SETS HIS TRAP.</head>
                    <p>â<hi rend="b">MAY</hi> I come in? I hope I do not disturb you, my dear
                        friend,â said Bonaparte, late one evening, putting his nose in at the cabin
                        door, where the German and his son sat finishing their supper.</p>
                    <p>It was now two months since he had been installed as schoolmaster in Tant'
                        Sannie's household, and he had grown mighty and more mighty day by day. He
                        visited the cabin no more, sat close to Tant' Sannie drinking coffee all the
                        evening, and walked about loftily with his hands under the coat tails of the
                        German's black cloth and failed to see even a nigger who wished him the time
                        of day. It was<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7167-119"/> therefore with no small
                        surprise that the German perceived Bonaparte's red nose at the door.</p>
                    <p>âWalk in, walk in,â he said joyfully. âBoy, boy, see if there is any coffee
                        left. Well, none. Make a fire. We have done supper, butââ</p>
                    <p>âMy dear friend,â said Bonaparte, taking off his hat, âI came not to sup, not
                        for mere creature comforts, but for an hour of brotherly intercourse with a
                        kindred spirit. The press of business and the weight of thought, but they
                        alone, may sometimes prevent me from sharing the secrets of my bosom with
                        him for whom I have so great a sympathy. You perhaps wonder when I shall
                        return the two poundsââ</p>
                    <p>âOh, no, no! Make a fire, make a fire, boy. We will have a pot of hot coffee
                        presently,â said the German, rubbing his hands and looking about, not
                        knowing how best to show his pleasure at the unexpected visit.</p>
                    <p>For three weeks the German's diffident<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7167-120"/>
                        âGood eveningâ had met with a stately bow; the chin of Bonaparte lifting
                        itself higher daily; and his shadow had not darkened the cabin doorway since
                        he came to borrow the two pounds. The German walked to the head of the bed
                        and took down a blue bag that hung there. Blue bags were a speciality of the
                        German's. He kept above fifty stowed away in different corners of his
                        roomâsome filled with curious stones, some with seeds that had been in his
                        possession fifteen years, some with rusty nails, buckles, and bits of old
                        harnessâin all, a wonderful assortment, but highly prized.</p>
                    <p>âWe have something here not so bad,â said the German, smiling knowingly, as
                        he dived his hand into the bag and took out a handful of almonds and
                        raisins; âI buy these for my chickens. They increase in size, but they still
                        think the old man must have something nice for them. And the old manâwell, a
                        big boy<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7167-121"/> may have a sweet tooth sometimes,
                        may he not? Ha, ha!â said the German, chuckling at his own joke, as he
                        heaped the plate with almonds. âHere is a stoneâtwo stones to crack themâno
                        late patent improvementâwell, Adam's nut-cracker; ha, ha! But I think we
                        shall do. We will not leave them uncracked. We will consume a few without
                        fashionable improvements.â</p>
                    <p>Here the German sat down on one side of the table, Bonaparte on the other;
                        each one with a couple of flat stones before him, and the plate between
                        them.</p>
                    <p>âDo not be afraid,â said the German, âdo not be afraid. I do not forget the
                        boy at the fire; I crack for him. The bag is full. Why, this is strange,â he
                        said suddenly, cracking upon a large nut; âthree kernels! I have not
                        observed that before. This must be retained. This is valuable.â He wrapped
                        the nut gravely in paper, and put it carefully in his waistcoat-pocket.<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7167-122"/> âValuable, very valuable!â he said,
                        shaking his head.</p>
                    <p>âAh, my friend,â said Bonaparte, âwhat joy it is to be once more in your
                        society.â</p>
                    <p>The German's eyes glistened, and Bonaparte seized his hand and squeezed it
                        warmly. They then proceeded to crack and eat. After a while Bonaparte said,
                        stuffing a handful of raisins into his mouth,â</p>
                    <p>âI was so deeply grieved, my dear friend, that you and Tant' Sannie had some
                        slight unpleasantness this evening.â</p>
                    <p>âOh, no, no,â said the German; âit is all right now. A few sheep missing; but
                        I make it good myself. I give my twelve sheep, and work in the other
                        eight.â</p>
                    <p>âIt is rather hard that you should have to make good the lost sheep,â said
                        Bonaparte; âit is no fault of yours.â</p>
                    <p>âWell,â said the German, âthis is the case. Last evening I count the sheep at
                        the kraalâ<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7167-123"/> twenty are missing. I ask the
                        herd; he tells me they are with the other flock; he tells me so
                            <emph>distinctly</emph>; how can I think he lies? This afternoon I count
                        the other flock. The sheep are not there. I come back here: the herd is
                        gone; the sheep are gone. But I cannotâno, I will notâbelieve he stole
                        them,â said the German, growing suddenly excited. âSome one else, but not
                        he. I know that boy. I knew him three years. He is a good boy. I have seen
                        him deeply affected on account of his soul. And she would send the police
                        after him! I say I would rather make the loss good myself. I will not have
                        it; he has fled in fear. I know his heart. It was,â said the German, with a
                        little gentle hesitation, âunder my words that he first felt his need of a
                        Saviour.â</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte cracked some more almonds, then said, yawning, and more as though
                        he asked for the sake of having something to converse<pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7167-124"/> about than from any interest he felt in the
                        subjectâ</p>
                    <p>âAnd what has become of the herd's wife?â</p>
                    <p>The German was alight again in a moment.</p>
                    <p>âYes; his wife. She has a child six days old, and Tant' Sannie would turn her
                        out into the fields this night. That,â said the German rising, âthat is what
                        I call crueltyâdiabolical cruelty. My soul abhors that deed. The man that
                        could do such a thing I could run him through with a knife!â said the
                        German, his grey eyes flashing, and his bushy black beard adding to the
                        murderous fury of his aspect. Then suddenly subsiding, he said,ââBut all is
                        now well; Tant' Sannie gives her word that the maid shall remain for some
                        days. I go to Oom Muller's to-morrow to learn if the sheep may not be there.
                        If they are not, then I return. They are gone, that is all. I make it
                        good.â</p>
                    <pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7167-125"/>
                    <p>âTant' Sannie is a singular woman,â said Bonaparte, taking the tobacco bag
                        the German passed to him.</p>
                    <p>âSingular! Yes,â said the German; âbut her heart is on her right side. I have
                        lived long years with her, and I may say, I have for her an affection, which
                        she returns. I may say,â added the German with warmth, âI may say, that
                        there is not one soul on this farm for whom I have <emph>not</emph> an
                        affection.â</p>
                    <p>âAh, my friend,â said Bonaparte, âwhen the grace of God is in our hearts, is
                        it not so with us all? Do we not love the very worm we tread upon, and as we
                        tread upon it? Do we know distinctions of race, or of sex, or of colour?
                            <emph>No!</emph>

                            </lg>
                        </q></p>
                    <p>After a time he sank into a less fervent mood, and remarked,â</p>
                    <p>âThe coloured female who waits upon Tant'<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7167-126"/>
                        Sannie appears to be of a virtuous disposition, an individual whoââ</p>
                    <p>âVirtuous!â said the German; âI have confidence in her. There is that in her
                        which is pure, that which is noble. The rich and high that walk this earth
                        with lofty eyelids might exchange with her.â</p>
                    <p>The German here got up to bring a coal for Bonaparte's pipe, and they sat
                        together talking for a while. At length Bonaparte knocked the ashes out of
                        his pipe.</p>
                    <p>âIt is time that I took my departure, dear friend,â he said; âbut, before I
                        do so, shall we not close this evening of sweet communion and brotherly
                        intercourse by a few words of prayer? Oh, how good and how pleasant a thing
                        it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the dew upon the
                        mountains of Hermon; for there the Lord bestowed a blessing, even life for
                        evermore.â</p>
                    <p>âStay and drink some coffee,â said the German.</p>
                    <pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7167-127"/>
                    <p>âNo, thank you, my friend; I have business that must be done to-night,â said
                        Bonaparte. âYour dear son appears to have gone to sleep. He is going to take
                        the waggon to the mill to-morrow! What a little <emph>man</emph> he is.â</p>
                    <p>âA fine boy.â</p>
                    <p>But though the boy nodded before the fire he was not asleep; and they all
                        knelt down to pray.</p>
                    <p>When they rose from their knees Bonaparte extended his hand to Waldo, and
                        patted him on the head.</p>
                    <p>âGood night, my boy,â said he. âAs you go to the mill to-morrow, we shall not
                        see you for some days. Good night! Good-bye! The Lord bless and guide you;
                        and may He bring you back to us in safety, to find us all <emph>as you have
                            left us</emph>! And you, my dear friend,â he added, turning with
                        redoubled warmth to the German, âlong, long shall I look back to this
                        evening as a time of refreshing from the presence of<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7167-128"/> the Lord, as an hour of blessed intercourse with
                        a brother in Jesus. May such often return. The Lord bless you!â he added,
                        with yet deeper fervour, ârichly, richly.â</p>
                    <p>Then he opened the door and vanished out into the darkness.</p>
                    <p>âHe, he, he!â laughed Bonaparte, as he stumbled over the stones. âIf there
                        isn't the rarest lot of fools on this farm that ever God Almighty stuck legs
                        to. He, he, he! When the worms come out then the blackbirds feed. Ha, ha,
                        ha!â</p>
                    <p>He looked in at the kitchen door. The Hottentot maid who acted as interpreter
                        between Tant' Sannie and himself was gone, and Tant' Sannie herself was in
                        bed.</p>
                    <p>âNever mind, Bon, my boy,â he said, as he walked round to his own room,
                        âto-morrow will do. He, he, he!â</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                    <head type="sub">HE CATCHES THE OLD BIRD.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="b">AT</hi> four o'clock the next afternoon the German rode across
                        the plain, returning from his search for the lost sheep. He rode slowly, for
                        he had been in the saddle since sunrise and was somewhat weary, and the heat
                        of the afternoon made his horse sleepy as it picked its way slowly along the
                        sandy road. Every now and then a great red spider would start out of the
                        karroo on one side of the path and run across to the other, but nothing else
                        broke the still monotony. Presently, behind one of the highest of the
                        milk-bushes that dotted the roadside, the German caught sight of a Kaffir
                        woman, seated there evidently for such shadow as the milk-bush<pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7167-130"/> might afford from the sloping rays of the sun.
                        The German turned the horse's head out of the road. It was not his way to
                        pass a living creature without a word of greeting. Coming nearer, he found
                        it was no other than the wife of the absconding Kaffir herd. She had a baby
                        tied on her back by a dirty strip of red blanket; another strip hardly
                        larger was twisted round her waist, for the rest her black body was naked.
                        She was a sullen, ill-looking woman, with lips hideously protruding.</p>
                    <p>The German questioned her as to how she came there. She muttered in broken
                        Dutch that she had been turned away. Had she done evil? She shook her head
                        sullenly. Had she had food given her? She grunted a negative, and fanned the
                        flies from her baby. Telling the woman to remain where she was, he turned
                        his horse's head to the road and rode off at a furious pace.</p>
                    <p>âHard-hearted! cruel! Oh, my God! Is this the way? Is this charity?â</p>
                    <pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7167-131"/>
                    <p>âYes, yes, yes,â ejaculated the old man as he rode on; but, presently, his
                        anger began to evaporate, his horse's pace slackened, and by the time he had
                        reached his own door he was nodding and smiling.</p>
                    <p>Dismounting quickly, he went to the great chest where his provisions were
                        kept. Here he got out a little meal, a little mealies, a few roaster-cakes.
                        These he tied up in three blue handkerchiefs, and putting them into a
                        sail-cloth bag, he strung them over his shoulders. Then he looked
                        circumspectly out at the door. It was very bad to be discovered in the act
                        of giving; it made him red up to the roots of his old grizzled hair. No one
                        was about, however, so he rode off again. Beside the milk-bush sat the
                        Kaffir woman stillâlike Hagar, he thought, thrust out by her mistress in the
                        wilderness to die. Telling her to loosen the handkerchief from her head, he
                        poured into it the contents of his bag. The woman tied it up in sullen
                        silence.</p>
                    <pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7167-132"/>
                    <p>âYou must try and get to the next farm,â said the German.</p>
                    <p>The woman shook her head; she would sleep in the field.</p>
                    <p>The German reflected. Kaffir women were accustomed to sleep in the open air;
                        but then, the child was small, and after so hot a day the night might be
                        chilly. That she would creep back to the huts at the homestead when the
                        darkness favoured her, the German's sagacity did not make evident to him. He
                        took off the old brown salt-and-pepper coat, and held it out to her. The
                        woman received it in silence, and laid it across her knee. âWith that they
                        will sleep warmly; not so bad. Ha, ha!â said the German. And he rode home,
                        nodding his head in a manner that would have made any other man dizzy.</p>
                    <p>âI wish he would not come back to-night,â said Em, her face wet with
                        tears.</p>
                    <p>âIt will be just the same if he comes back to-morrow,â said Lyndall.</p>
                    <pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7167-133"/>
                    <p>The two girls sat on the step of the cabin weeping for the German's return.
                        Lyndall shaded her eyes with her hand from the sunset light.</p>
                    <p>âThere he comes,â she said, âwhistling âAch JerÃºsalem du schÃ¶neâ so loud I
                        can hear him from here.â</p>
                    <p>âPerhaps he has found the sheep.â</p>
                    <p>âFound them!â said Lyndall. âHe would whistle just so if he knew he had to
                        die to-night.â</p>
                    <p>âYou look at the sunset, eh, chickens?â the German said, as he came up at a
                        smart canter. âAh, yes, that <emph>is</emph> beautiful!â he added, as he
                        dismounted, pausing for a moment with his hand on the saddle to look at the
                        evening sky, where the sun shot up long flaming streaks, between which and
                        the eye thin yellow clouds floated. âEi! you weep?â said the German, as the
                        girls ran up to him.</p>
                    <p>Before they had time to reply the voice of Tant' Sannie was heard.</p>
                    <pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7167-134"/>
                    <p>âYou child, of the child, of the child of a Kaffir's dog, come here!â</p>
                    <p>The German looked up. He thought the Dutch-woman, come out to cool herself in
                        the yard, called to some misbehaving Kaffir. The old man looked round to see
                        who it might be.</p>
                    <p>âYou old vagabond of a praying German, are you deaf?â</p>
                    <p>Tant' Sannie stood before the steps of the kitchen; upon them sat the lean
                        Hottentot, upon the highest stood Bonaparte Blenkins, both hands folded
                        under the tails of his coat, and his eyes fixed on the sunset sky.</p>
                    <p>The German dropped the saddle on the ground.</p>
                    <p>âBish, bish, bish! what may <emph>this</emph> be?â he said, and walked toward
                        the house. âVery strange!â</p>
                    <p>The girls followed him: Em still weeping; Lyndall with her face rather white
                        and her eyes wide open.</p>
                    <p>âAnd I have the heart of a devil, did you<pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7167-135"/>
                        say? You could run me through with a knife, could you?â cried the
                        Dutch-woman. âI could not drive the Kaffir girl away because I was afraid of
                            <emph>you</emph>, was I? Oh, you miserable rag! I loved you, did I? I
                        would have liked to marry you, <emph>would</emph> I? would I? WOULD I?â
                        cried the Boer-woman; âyou cat's tail, you dog's paw! Be near my house
                        to-morrow morning when the sun rises,â she gasped, âmy Kaffirs will drag you
                        through the sand. They would do it gladly, any of them, for a bit of
                        tobacco, for all your prayings with them.â</p>
                    <p>âI am bewildered, I am bewildered, said the German, standing before her and
                        raising his hand to his forehead; âIâI do not understand.â</p>
                    <p>âAsk him, ask him!â cried Tant' Sannie, pointing to Bonaparte; âhe knows. You
                        thought he could not make me understand, but he did, he did, you old fool! I
                        know enough English for that. You be here,â shouted the Dutch-woman,<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7167-136"/> âwhen the morning star rises, and I will
                        let my Kaffirs take you out and drag you, till there is not one bone left in
                        your old body that is not broken as fine as bobotie-meat, you old beggar!
                        All your rags are not worth that they should be thrown out onto the
                        ash-heap,â cried the Boer-woman; âbut I will have them for my sheep. Not one
                        rotten hoof of your old mare do you take with you; I will have herâall, all
                        for my sheep that you have lost, you godless thing!â</p>
                    <p>The Boer-woman wiped the moisture from her mouth with the palm of her
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>The German turned to Bonaparte, who still stood on the step absorbed in the
                        beauty of the sunset.</p>
                    <p>âDo not address me; do not approach me, lost man,â said Bonaparte, not moving
                        his eye nor lowering his chin. âThere is a crime from which all nature
                        revolts; there is a crime whose name is loathsome to the human earâ that
                        crime is yours; that crime is ingratitude. This<pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7167-137"/> woman has been your benefactress; on her farm you
                        have lived; after her sheep you have looked; into her house you have been
                        allowed to enter and hold Divine serviceâan honour of which you were never
                        worthy; and how have you rewarded her?âBasely, basely, basely!â</p>
                    <p>âBut it is all false, lies and falsehoods. I must, I will speak,â said the
                        German, suddenly looking round bewildered. âDo I dream? Are you mad? What
                        may it be?â</p>
                    <p>âGo, dog,â cried the Dutchwoman; âI would have been a rich woman this day if
                        it had not been for your laziness. Praying with the Kaffirs behind the kraal
                        walls. Go, you Kaffir's dog!â</p>
                    <p>âBut what then is the matter? What may have happened since I left?â said the
                        German, turning to the Hottentot woman who sat upon the step.</p>
                    <p><emph>She</emph> was his friend; she would tell him kindly the truth. The
                        woman answered by a loud, ringing laugh.</p>
                    <pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7167-138"/>
                    <p>âGive it him, old missis! Give it him!â</p>
                    <p>It was so nice to see the white man who had been master hunted down. The
                        coloured woman laughed, and threw a dozen mealie grains into her mouth to
                        chew.</p>
                    <p>All anger and excitement faded from the old man's face. He turned slowly away
                        and walked down the little path to his cabin, with his shoulders bent; it
                        was all dark before him. He stumbled over the threshold of his own
                        well-known door.</p>
                    <p>Em, sobbing bitterly, would have followed him; but the Boer-woman prevented
                        her by a flood of speech which convulsed the Hottentot, so low were its
                        images.</p>
                    <p>âCome, Em,â said Lyndall, lifting her small proud head, âlet us go in. We
                        will not stay to hear such language.â</p>
                    <p>She looked into the Boer-woman's eyes. Tant' Sannie understood the meaning of
                        the look if not the words. She waddled after them, and<pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7167-139"/> caught Em by the arm. She had struck Lyndall once
                        years before, and had never done it again, so she took Em.</p>
                    <p>âSo you will defy me, too, will you, you Englishman's ugliness!â she cried,
                        and with one hand she forced the child down, and held her head tightly
                        against her knee; with the other she beat her face, first upon one cheek and
                        then upon the other.</p>
                    <p>For one instant Lyndall looked on, then she laid her small fingers on the
                        Boer-woman's arm. With the exertion of half its strength Tant' Sannie might
                        have flung the girl back upon the stones. It was not the power of the slight
                        fingers, tightly though they clinched her broad wristâso tightly that at
                        bedtime the marks were still there; but the Boer-woman looked into the clear
                        eyes and at the quivering white lips, and with a half-surprised curse
                        relaxed her hold. The girl drew Em's arm through her own.</p>
                    <p>âMove!â she said to Bonaparte, who stood in<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7167-140"/>
                        the door; and he, Bonaparte the invincible, in the hour of his triumph,
                        moved to give her place.</p>
                    <p>The Hottentot ceased to laugh, and an uncomfortable silence fell on all the
                        three in the doorway.</p>
                    <p>Once in their room, Em sat down on the floor and wailed bitterly. Lyndall lay
                        on the bed with her arm drawn across her eyes, very white and still.</p>
                    <p>âHoo, hoo!â cried Em; âand they won't let him take the grey mare; and Waldo
                        has gone to the mill. Hoo, hoo, and perhaps they won't let us go and say
                        good-bye to him. Hoo, hoo, hoo!â</p>
                    <p>âI wish you would be quiet,â said Lyndall without moving. âDoes it give you
                        such felicity to let Bonaparte know he is hurting you? We will ask no one.
                        It will be supper-time soon. Listen,âand when you hear the clink of the
                        knives and forks we will go out and see him.</p>
                    <pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7167-141"/>
                    <p>Em suppressed her sobs and listened intently, kneeling at the door. Suddenly
                        some one came to the window and put the shutter up.</p>
                    <p>âWho was that?â said Lyndall, starting.</p>
                    <p>âThe girl, I suppose,â said Em. âHow early she is this evening!â</p>
                    <p>But Lyndall sprang from the bed and seized the handle of the door, shaking it
                        fiercely. The door was locked on the outside. She ground her teeth.</p>
                    <p>âWhat is the matter?â asked Em.</p>
                    <p>The room was in perfect darkness now.</p>
                    <p>âNothing,â said Lyndall quietly; âonly they have locked us in.â</p>
                    <p>She turned, and went back to bed again. But ere long Em heard a sound of
                        movement. Lyndall had climbed up into the window, and with her fingers felt
                        the wood-work that surrounded the panes. Slipping down, the girl loosened
                        the iron knob from the foot of the bedstead, and climbing up again, she
                        broke with it every pane of glass<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7167-142"/> in the
                        window, beginning at the top and ending at the bottom.</p>
                    <p>âWhat are you doing?â asked Em, who heard the falling fragments.</p>
                    <p>Her companion made her no reply; but with all her weight leaned on every
                        little cross-bar, which cracked and gave way beneath her. Then she pressed
                        with all her strength against the shutter. She had thought the wooden
                        buttons would give way, but by the clinking sound she knew that the iron bar
                        had been put across. She was quite quiet for a time. Clambering down, she
                        took from the table a small one-bladed penknife, with which she began to
                        peck at the hard wood of the shutter.</p>
                    <p>âWhat are you doing now?â asked Em, who had ceased crying in her wonder, and
                        had drawn near.</p>
                    <p>âTrying to make a hole?â was the short reply.</p>
                    <p>âDo you think you will be able to?â</p>
                    <pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7167-143"/>
                    <p>âNo; but I am trying.â</p>
                    <p>In an agony of suspense Em waited. For ten minutes Lyndall pecked. The hole
                        was three-eighths of an inch deepâthen the blade sprang into ten pieces.</p>
                    <p>âWhat has happened now?â Em asked, blubbering afresh.</p>
                    <p>âNothing,â said Lyndall. âBring me my night-gown, a piece of paper, and the
                        matches.â</p>
                    <p>Wondering, Em fumbled about till she found them.</p>
                    <p>âWhat are you going to do with them,â she whispered.</p>
                    <p>âBurn it down.â</p>
                    <p>âBut won't the whole house take fire and burn down too?â</p>
                    <p>âYes.â</p>
                    <p>âBut will it not be very wicked?â</p>
                    <p>âYes, very. And I don't care.â</p>
                    <p>She arranged the night-gown carefully in the corner of the window, with the
                        chips of the<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7167-144"/> frame about it. There was
                        only one match in the box. She drew it carefully along the wall. For a
                        moment it burnt up blue, and showed the tiny face with its glistening eyes.
                        She held it carefully to the paper. For an instant it burnt up brightly,
                        then flickered and went out. She blew the spark, but it died also. Then she
                        threw the paper on to the ground, trod on it, and went to her bed, and began
                        to undress.</p>
                    <p>Em rushed to the door, knocking against it wildly.</p>
                    <p>âTant' Sannie! Tant' Sannie! Oh, let us out!â she cried. âOh, Lyndall, what
                        are we to do?â</p>
                    <p>Lyndall wiped a drop of blood off the lip she had bitten.</p>
                    <p>âI am going to sleep,â she said. âIf you like to sit there and howl till the
                        morning, do. Perhaps you will find that it helps; I never heard that howling
                        helped any one.â</p>
                    <pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7167-145"/>
                    <p>Long after, when Em herself had gone to bed and was almost asleep, Lyndall
                        came and stood at her bedside.</p>
                    <p>âHere,â she said, slipping a little pot of powder into her hand; ârub some on
                        to your face. Does it not burn where she struck you?â</p>
                    <p>Then she crept back to her own bed. Long, long after, when Em was really
                        asleep, she lay still awake, and folded her hands on her little breast, and
                        muttered,â</p>
                    <p>âWhen that day comes, and I am strong, I will hate everything that has power,
                        and help everything that is weak.â And she bit her lip again.</p>
                    <p>The German looked out at the cabin door for the last time that night. Then he
                        paced the room slowly and sighed. Then he drew out pen and paper, and sat
                        down to write, rubbing his old grey eyes with his knuckles before he
                        began.</p>

                                    <p>âI sit here alone, and I think of you. Will you forget the
                                        old man? When you wake to-morrow he will be far away. The
                                        old horse is lazy, but he has his stick to help him; that is
                                        three legs. He comes back one day with gold and diamonds.
                                        Will you welcome him? Well, we shall see. I go to meet
                                        Waldo. He comes back with the waggon; then he follows me.
                                        Poor boy! God knows. There is a land where all things are
                                        made right, but that land is not here.</p>
                                    <p>âMy little children, serve the Saviour; give your hearts to
                                        Him while you are yet young. Life is short.</p>
                                    <p>âNothing is mine, otherwise I would say, Lyndall, take my
                                        books, Em my stones. Now I say nothing. The things are mine;
                                        it is not righteous, God knows! But I am silent. Let it be.
                                        But I feel it, I must say I feel it.</p>

                                    <p>âI love my children. Do they think of me? I am Old Otto, who

                    <p>Having concluded this quaint production, he put it where the children would
                        find it the next morning, and proceeded to prepare his bundle. He never
                        thought of entering a protest against the loss of his goods; like a child,
                        he submitted, and wept. He had been there eleven years, and it was hard to
                        go away. He spread open on the bed a blue handkerchief, and on it put one by
                        one the things he thought most necessary and importantâa little bag of
                        curious seeds, which he meant to plant some day, an old German hymn-book,
                        three misshapen stones that he greatly valued, a Bible, a shirt and two
                        handkerchiefs; then there was room for nothing more. He tied up the bundle
                        tightly and put it on a chair by his bed-side.</p>
                    <pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7167-148"/>
                    <p>âThat is not much; they cannot say I take much,â he said, looking at it.</p>
                    <p>He put his knotted stick beside it, his blue tobacco bag and his short pipe,
                        and then inspected his coats. He had two leftâa moth-eaten over-coat and a
                        black alpaca out at the elbows. He decided for the over-coat; it was warm,
                        certainly, but then he could carry it over his arm and only put it on when
                        he met some one along the road. It was more respectable than the black
                        alpaca. He hung the great-coat over the back of the chair, and stuffed a
                        hard bit of roaster-cake under the knot of the bundle, and then his
                        preparations were completed. The German stood contemplating them with much
                        satisfaction. He had almost forgotten his sorrow at leaving in his pleasure
                        at preparing. Suddenly he started; an expression of intense pain passed over
                        his face. He drew back his left arm quickly, and then pressed his right hand
                        upon his breast.</p>
                    <p>âAh, the sudden pang again,â he said.</p>
                    <pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7167-149"/>
                    <p>His face was white, but it quickly regained its colour. Then the old man
                        busied himself in putting everything right.</p>
                    <p>âI will leave it neat. They shall not say I did not leave it neat,â he said.
                        Even the little bags of seeds on the mantel-piece he put in rows and dusted.
                        Then he undressed and got into bed. Under his pillow was a little
                        story-book. He drew it forth. To the old German a story was no story. Its
                        events were as real and as important to himself as the matters of his own
                        life. He could not go away without knowing whether that wicked Earl relented
                        and whether the Baron married Emilina. So he adjusted his spectacles and
                        began to read. Occasionally, as his feelings became too strongly moved, he
                        ejaculated, âAh, I thought so!âThat was a rogue!âI saw it before!âI knew it
                        from the beginning!â More than half-an-hour had passed when he looked up to
                        the silver watch at the top of his bed.</p>
                    <pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7167-150"/>
                    <p>âThe march is long to-morrow; this will not do,â he said, taking off his
                        spectacles and putting them carefully into the book to mark the place. âThis
                        will be good reading as I walk along to-morrow,â he added, as he stuffed the
                        book into the pocket of the great-coat; âvery good reading.â He nodded his
                        head and lay down. He thought a little of his own troubles, a good deal of
                        the two little girls he was leaving, of the Earl, of Emilina, of the Baron;
                        but he was soon asleepâsleeping as peacefully as a little child upon whose
                        innocent soul sorrow and care cannot rest.</p>
                    <p>It was very quiet in the room. The coals in the fire-place threw a dull red
                        light across the floor upon the red lions on the quilt. Eleven o'clock came,
                        and the room was very still. One o'clock came. The glimmer had died out,
                        though the ashes were still warm, and the room was very dark. The grey
                        mouse, who had its hole under the tool-box, came out and sat on the sacks
                            in<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7167-151"/> the corner; then, growing bolder,
                        the room was so dark, it climbed the chair at the bedside, nibbled at the
                        roaster-cake, took one bite quickly at the candle, and then sat on his
                        haunches listening. It heard the even breathing of the old man, and the
                        steps of the hungry Kaffir dog going his last round in search of a bone or a
                        skin that had been forgotten; and it heard the white hen call out as the
                        wild cat ran away with one of her brood, and it heard the chicken cry. Then
                        the grey mouse went back to its hole under the tool-box, and the room was
                        quiet. And two o'clock came. By that time the night was grown dull and
                        cloudy. The wild cat had gone to its home on the kopje; the Kaffir's dog had
                        found a bone, and lay gnawing it.</p>
                    <p>An intense quiet reigned everywhere. Only in her room the Boer-woman tossed
                        her great arms in her sleep; for she dreamed that a dark shadow with
                        outstretched wings fled slowly over<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7167-152"/> her
                        house, and she moaned and shivered. And the night was very still.</p>
                    <p>But quiet as all places were, there was a quite peculiar quiet in the
                        German's room. Though you strained your ear most carefully you caught no
                        sound of breathing.</p>
                    <p>He was not gone, for the old coat still hung on the chairâthe coat that was
                        to be put on when he met any one; and the bundle and stick were ready for
                        to-morrow's long march. The old German himself lay there, his wavy black
                        hair just touched with grey thrown back upon the pillow. The old face was
                        lying there alone in the dark, smiling like a little child'sâoh, so
                        peacefully. There is a stranger whose coming, they say, is worse than all
                        the ills of life, from whose presence we flee away trembling; but he comes
                        very tenderly sometimes. And it seemed almost as though Death had known and
                        loved the old man, so gently it touched him. And how could it deal hardly<pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7167-153"/> with himâthe loving, simple, childlike
                        old man?</p>
                    <p>So it smoothed out the wrinkles that were in the old forehead, and fixed the
                        passing smile, and sealed the eyes that they might not weep again; and then
                        the short sleep of time was melted into the long, long sleep of
                        eternity.</p>
                    <p>âHow has he grown so young in this one night?â they said when they found him
                        in the morning.</p>
                    <p>Yes, dear old man; to such as you time brings no age. You die with the purity
                        and innocence of your childhood upon you, though you die in your grey
                        hairs.</p>

                        a moving speck, and he chucked his coat-tails up and down in expectancy of a
                        dainty morsel.</p>
                    <p>The waggon came on slowly. Waldo lay curled among the sacks at the back of
                        the waggon, his hand in his breast resting on the sheep-shearing machine. It
                        was finished now. The right thought had struck him the day before as he sat,
                        half asleep, watching the water go over the mill-wheel. He muttered to
                        himself with half-closed eyes,â</p>
                    <p>âTo-morrow smooth the cogsâtighten the screws a littleâshow it to them.â Then
                        after a<pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7167-155"/> pauseââOver the whole worldâthe
                        whole worldâmine, that I have made!â He pressed the little wheels and
                        pulleys in his pocket till they cracked. Presently his muttering became
                        louderââAnd fifty poundsâa black hat for my dadâfor Lyndall a blue silk,
                        very light, and one purple like the earth-bells, and white shoes.â He
                        muttered onââA box full, full of books. They shall tell me all, all, all,â
                        he added, moving his fingers desiringly: âwhy the crystals grow in such
                        beautiful shapes; why lightning runs to the iron; why black people are
                        black; why the sunlight makes things warm. I shall read, read, read,â he
                        muttered slowly. Then came over him suddenly what he called âThe presence of
                        God;â a sense of a good, strong something folding him round. He smiled
                        through his half-shut eyes. âAh, Father, my own Father, it is so sweet to
                        feel you, like the warm sunshine. The Bibles and books cannot tell of you
                        and all I feel you. They are mixed with men's words; but youââ</p>
                    <pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7167-156"/>
                    <p>His muttering sank into inaudible confusion, till, opening his eyes wide, it
                        struck him that the brown plain he looked at was the old home farm. For half
                        an hour they had been riding in it, and he had not known it. He roused the
                        leader, who sat nodding on the front of the waggon in the early morning
                        sunlight. They were within half a mile of the homestead. It seemed to him
                        that he had been gone from them all a year. He fancied he could see Lyndall
                        standing on the brick wall to watch for him; his father, passing from one
                        house to the other, stopping to look.</p>
                    <p>He called aloud to the oxen. For each one at home he had brought something.
                        For his father a piece of tobacco, bought at the shop by the mill; for Em a
                        thimble; for Lyndall a beautiful flower dug out by the roots, at a place
                        where they had âout-spannedâ; for Tant' Sannie a handkerchief. When they
                        drew near the house he threw the whip to the Kaffir leader, and sprang<pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7167-157"/> from the side of the waggon to rush on.
                        Bonaparte stopped him as he ran past the ash-heap.</p>
                    <p>âGood morning, my dear boy. Where are you running to so fast with your rosy
                        cheeks?â</p>
                    <p>The boy looked up at him, glad even to see Bonaparte.</p>
                    <p>âI am going to the cabin,â he said, out of breath.</p>
                    <p>âYou won't find them in just nowânot your good old father,â said
                        Bonaparte.</p>
                    <p>âWhere is he?â asked the lad.</p>
                    <p>âThere, beyond the camps,â said Bonaparte, waving his hand oratorically
                        toward the stone-walled ostrich-camps.</p>
                    <p>âWhat is he doing there?â asked the boy.</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte patted him on the cheek kindly.</p>
                    <p>âHe smelt so, we could not keep him any more. We've buried him, my boy,â said
                        Bonaparte, sticking his finger into the boy's cheek. âHe was quite bad
                        already. He, he, he!â laughed Bonaparte, as the boy fled away<pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7167-158"/> along the low stone wall, almost furtively, as
                        one in fear. There was a gurgling of enjoyment in the man's stomach.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="*   *   *   *   *"/>
                    <p>At five o'clock Bonaparte knelt before a box in the German's room. He was
                        busily unpacking it.</p>
                    <p>It had been agreed upon between Tant' Sannie and himself, that now the German
                        was gone he, Bonaparte, was to be no longer schoolmaster, but overseer of
                        the farm. In return for his past scholastic labours he had expressed himself
                        willing to take possession of the dead man's goods and room. Tant' Sannie
                        hardly liked the arrangement. She had a great deal more respect for the
                        German dead than the German living, and would rather his goods had been
                        allowed to descend peacefully to his son. For she was a firm believer in the
                        chinks in the world above, where not only ears, but eyes might be applied to
                        see how things went on in this world below.<pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7167-159"/> She never felt sure how far the spirit-world might overlap this world of
                        sense, and, as a rule, prudently abstained from doing anything which might
                        offend unseen auditors. For this reason she abstained from ill-using the
                        dead Englishman's daughter and niece, and for this reason she would rather
                        the boy had had his father's goods. But it was hard to refuse Bonaparte
                        anything when she and he sat so happily together in the evening drinking
                        coffee, Bonaparte telling her in the broken Dutch he was fast learning how
                        he adored fat women, and what a splendid farmer he was.</p>
                    <p>So at five o'clock on this afternoon Bonaparte knelt in the German's
                        room.</p>
                    <p>âSomewhere, here it is,â he said, as he packed the old clothes carefully out
                        of the box, and, finding nothing, packed them in again. âSomewhere in this
                        room it is; and if it's here Bonaparte finds it,â he repeated. âYou didn't
                        stay here all these years without making a little pile<pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7167-160"/> somewhere, my lamb. You weren't such a fool as
                        you looked. Oh, no!â said Bonaparte.</p>
                    <p>He now walked about the room, diving his fingers in everywhere: sticking them
                        into the great crevices in the wall and frightening out the spiders; rapping
                        them against the old plaster till it cracked and fell in pieces; peering up
                        the chimney, till the soot dropped on his bald head and blackened it. He
                        felt in little bags; he tried to raise the hearth stone; he shook each book,
                        till the old leaves fell down in showers on the floor.</p>
                    <p>It was getting dark, and Bonaparte stood with his finger on his nose
                        reflecting. Finally he walked to the door, behind which hung the trousers
                        and waistcoat the dead man had last worn. He had felt in them but hurriedly
                        just after the funeral the day before; he would examine them again. Sticking
                        his fingers into the waistcoat pockets, he found in one corner a hole.
                        Pressing his hand through it, between the<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7167-161"/>
                        lining and the cloth, he presently came into contact with something.
                        Bonaparte drew it forthâa small, square parcel, sewed up in sail-cloth. He
                        gazed at it, squeezed it; it cracked, as though full of bank notes. He put
                        it quickly into his own waistcoat pocket, and peeped over the half-door to
                        see if there was no one coming. Then he sat down on the nearest chair, and
                        taking out his pen-knife, ripped it open. The first thing that fell was a
                        shower of yellow, faded papers. Bonaparte opened them carefully one by one,
                        and smoothed them out on his knee. They were certainly something very
                        valuable to be hidden so carefully, though the German characters he could
                        not decipher. When he came to the last one, he felt there was something hard
                        in it.</p>
                    <p>âYou've got it, Bon, my boy! you've got it!â he cried, slapping his leg hard.
                        Edging nearer to the door, for the light was fading, he opened it carefully.
                        There was nothing inside but a plain gold wedding-ring.</p>
                    <pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7167-162"/>
                    <p>âBetter than nothing!â said Bonaparte, trying to put it on his little finger,
                        which, however, proved too fat.</p>
                    <p>He took it off and set it down on the table before him, and looked at it with
                        his crosswise eyes.</p>
                    <p>âWhen that auspicious hour, Sannie,â he said, âshall have arrived, when,
                        panting, I shall lead thee, lighted by Hymen's torch, to the connubial
                        altar, then upon thy fair amaranthine finger, my joyous bride, shall this
                        ring repose. <q>
                            <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                                <l>âThy fair body, oh, my girl,</l>
                                <l>Shall Bonaparte possess;</l>
                                <l>His fingers in thy money-bags,</l>
                                <l>He therein, too, shall mess.â</l>
                            </lg>
                        </q></p>
                    <p>Having given utterance to this flood of poesy, he sat lost in joyous
                        reflection.</p>
                    <p>âHe therein, too, <emph>shall</emph> mess,â he repeated meditatively.</p>
                    <p>At this instant, as Bonaparte swore, and swore truly, to the end of his life,
                        a slow and distinct rap was given on the crown of his bald head.</p>
                    <pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7167-163"/>
                    <p>Bonaparte started and looked up. No âreim,â or strap hung down from the
                        rafters above, and not a human creature was near the door. It was growing
                        dark; he did not like it. He began to fold up the papers expeditiously. He
                        stretched out his hand for the ring. The ring was gone! Gone, although no
                        human creature had entered the room; gone, although no form had crossed the
                        doorway. Gone!</p>
                    <p>He would not sleep there, that was certain.</p>
                    <p>He stuffed the papers into his pocket. As he did so, three slow and distinct
                        taps were given on the crown of his head. Bonaparte's jaw fell: each
                        separate joint lost its power: he could not move; he dared not rise; his
                        tongue lay loose in his mouth.</p>
                    <p>âTake all, take all!â he gurgled in his throat. âIâI do not want them.
                        Takeââ</p>
                    <p>Here a resolute tug at the grey curls at the back of his head caused him to
                        leap up, yelling wildly. Was he to sit still paralyzed, to be<pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7167-164"/> dragged away <emph>bodily</emph> to the devil?
                        With terrific shrieks he fled, casting no glance behind.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="*   *   *   *   *"/>
                    <p>When the dew was falling, and the evening was dark, a small figure moved
                        toward the gate of the furthest ostrich camp, driving a bird before it. When
                        the gate was opened and the bird driven in turned away, but then suddenly
                        paused.</p>
                    <p>âIs that you, Waldo?â said Lyndall.</p>
                    <p>The boy was sitting on the damp ground with his back to the wall. He gave her
                        no answer.</p>
                    <p>âCome,â she said, bending over him, âI have been looking for you all
                        day.â</p>
                    <p>He mumbled something.</p>
                    <p>âYou have had nothing to eat. I have put some supper in your room. You must
                        come home with me, Waldo.â</p>
                    <p>She took his hand, and the boy rose slowly.</p>
                    <p>She made him take her arm, and twisted her small fingers among his.</p>
                    <pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7167-165"/>
                    <p>âYou must forget,â she whispered. âSince it happened I walk, I talk, I never
                        sit still. If we remember, we cannot bring back the dead.â She knit her
                        little fingers closer among his. âForgetting is the best thing. He did not
                        watch it coming,â she whispered presently. âThat is the dreadful thing, to
                        see it coming!â She shuddered. âI want it to come suddenly to me too. Why do
                        you think I was driving that bird?â she added quickly. âThat was Hans, the
                        bird that hates Bonaparte. I let him out this afternoon; I thought he would
                        chase him and perhaps kill him.â</p>
                    <p>The boy showed no sign of interest.</p>
                    <p>âHe didn't; but he put his head over the half door of your cabin and
                        frightened him horribly. He was there busy stealing your things. Perhaps he
                        will leave them alone now; but I wish the bird had trodden on him.â</p>
                    <p>They said no more till they reached the door of the cabin.</p>
                    <p>âThere is a candle and supper on the table.<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7167-166"/>
                        You must eat,â she said authoritatively. âI cannot stay with you now, lest
                        they find out about the bird.â</p>
                    <p>He grasped her arm and brought his mouth close to her ear.</p>
                    <p>âThere is no God!â he almost hissed; âno God, not anywhere!â</p>
                    <p>She started.</p>
                    <p>âNot anywhere!â</p>
                    <p>He ground it out between his teeth, and she felt his hot breath on her
                        cheek.</p>
                    <p>âWaldo, you are mad,â she said, drawing herself from him.</p>
                    <p>He loosened his grasp and turned away from her also.</p>
                    <p>In truth, it is life's way. We fight our little battles alone; you yours, I
                        mine. We are not to help or find help. When your life is most real, you seem
                        to me mad; when your agony is greatest I look at you and wonder. Friendship
                        is good, but it is a delusion.</p>
                    <pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7167-167"/>
                    <p>Lyndall stood by him in the dark, pityingly, wonderingly. As he walked to the
                        door she ran after him.</p>
                    <p>âEat your supper; it will do you good,â she said.</p>
                    <p>She pressed his hand and then ran away.</p>
                    <p>In the front room the little woolly Kaffir girl was washing Tant' Sannie's
                        feet in a small tub, and Bonaparte, who sat on the wooden sofa, was pulling
                        off his shoes and stockings that his own feet might be washed also. There
                        were three candles burning in the room, and he and Tant' Sannie sat close
                        together, with the lean Hottentot not far off; for when ghosts are about
                        there is great strength in numbers. Bonaparte had completely recovered from
                        the effects of his fright in the afternoon, and the numerous doses of brandy
                        that it had been necessary to administer to him to effect his restoration
                        had put him into a singularly pleasant and amiable mood.</p>
                    <p>âThat boy Waldo,â said Bonaparte, rubbing<pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7167-168"/>
                        his toes, âtook himself off coolly this morning as soon as the waggon came,
                        and has not done a stiver of work all day. <emph>I'll</emph> not have that
                        kind of thing now I'm master of this farm.â</p>
                    <p>The Hottentot maid translated.</p>
                    <p>âAh, I expect he's sorry that his father's dead,â said Tant' Sannie. âIt's
                        nature, you know. I cried the whole morning when my father died. One can
                        always get another husband, but one can't get another father,â said Tant'
                        Sannie, casting a sidelong glance at Bonaparte.</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte expressed a wish to give Waldo his orders for the next day's work,
                        and the little woolly-headed Kaffir was sent to call him. After some time he
                        appeared, and stood in the doorway.</p>
                    <p>If they had dressed him in one of the swallow-tailed coats, and oiled his
                        hair till the drops fell from it, and it lay as smooth as an elder's on
                        sacrament Sunday, there would still have been something unanointed in the
                        aspect of the<pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7167-169"/> fellow. As it was, standing
                        there in his strange old costume, his head presenting much the appearance of
                        having been deeply rolled in sand, his eyelids swollen, the hair hanging
                        over his forehead, and a dogged sullenness on his features, he presented
                        most the appearance of an ill-conditioned young buffalo.</p>
                    <p>âBeloved Lord,â cried Tant' Sannie, âhow he looks! Come in, boy. Couldn't you
                        come and say good-day to me? Don't you want some supper?â</p>
                    <p>He said he wanted nothing, and turned his heavy eyes away from her.</p>
                    <p>âThere's a ghost been seen in your father's room,â said Tant' Sannie. âIf
                        you're afraid you can sleep in the kitchen.â</p>
                    <p>âI will sleep in our room,â said the boy slowly.</p>
                    <p>âWell, you can go now,â she said; âbut be up early to take the sheep. The
                        herdââ</p>
                    <p>âYes, be up early, my boy,â interrupted<pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7167-170"/>
                        Bonaparte, smiling. âI am to be master of this farm now; and we shall be
                        good friends, I trust, very good friends, if you try to do your duty, my
                        dear boy.â</p>
                    <p>Waldo turned to go, and Bonaparte, looking benignly at the candle, stretched
                        out one unstockinged foot, over which Waldo, looking at nothing in
                        particular, fell with a heavy thud upon the floor.</p>
                    <p>âDear me! I hope you are not hurt, my boy,â said Bonaparte. âYou'll have many
                        a harder thing than that though, before you've got all you will get,â he
                        added consolingly, as Waldo picked himself up.</p>
                    <p>The lean Hottentot laughed till the room rang again; and Tant' Sannie
                        tittered till her sides ached.</p>
                    <p>When he had gone the little maid began to wash Bonaparte's feet.</p>
                    <p>âOh, Lord, beloved Lord, how he did fall! I can't think of it,â cried Tant'
                        Sannie, and she<pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7167-171"/> laughed again. âI always
                        did know he was not right; but this evening any one could see it,â she
                        added, wiping the tears of mirth from her face. âHis eyes are as wild as if
                        the devil was in them. He never <emph>was</emph> like other children. The
                        dear Lord knows, if he doesn't walk alone for hours talking to himself. If
                        you sit in the room with him you can see his lips moving the whole time; and
                        if you talk to him twenty times he doesn't hear you. Daft-eyes; he's as mad
                        as mad can be.â</p>
                    <p>This repetition of the word mad conveyed meaning to Bonaparte's mind. He left
                        off paddling his toes in the water.</p>
                    <p>âMad, mad? <emph>I</emph> know that kind of mad,â said Bonaparte, âand I know
                        the thing to give for it. The front end of a little horse-whip, the tip!
                        Nice thing; takes it out,â said Bonaparte.</p>
                    <p>The Hottentot laughed, and translated.</p>
                    <p>âNo more walking about and talking to themselves on this farm now,â said
                        Bonaparte; âno<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7167-172"/> more minding of sheep and
                        reading of books at the same time. The point of a horsewhip is a little
                        thing, but I think he'll have a taste of it before long.â Bonaparte, rubbing
                        his hands and looking pleasantly across his nose; and then the three laughed
                        together grimly.</p>
                    <p>And Waldo in his cabin crouched in the dark in a corner, with his knees drawn
                        up to his chin.</p>

                    <head type="sub">HE SHOWS HIS TEETH.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="b">DOSS</hi> sat among the karroo-bushes, one yellow ear drawn over
                        his wicked little eye, ready to flap away any adventurous fly that might
                        settle on his nose. Around him in the morning sunlight fed the sheep; behind
                        him lay his master polishing his machine. He found much comfort in handling
                        it that morning. A dozen philosophical essays, or angelically attuned songs
                        for the consolation of the bereaved, could never have been to him what that
                        little sheep-shearing machine was that day.</p>
                    <p>After struggling to see the unseeable, growing drunk with the endeavour to
                        span the infinite, and writhing before the inscrutable mystery, it<pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7167-174"/> is a renovating relief to turn to some
                        simple, feelable, weighable substance; to something which has a smell and a
                        colour, which may be handled and turned over this way and that. Whether
                        there be or be not a hereafter, whether there be any use in calling aloud to
                        the Unseen power, whether there be an Unseen power to call to, whatever be
                        the true nature of the <hi>I</hi> who call and of the objects around me,
                        whatever be our meaning, our internal <hi>essence</hi>, our <hi>cause</hi>
                        (and in a certain order of minds death and the agony of loss inevitably
                        awaken the wild desire, at other times smothered, to look into these
                        things), whatever be the nature of that which lies beyond the unbroken wall
                        which the limits of the human intellect build up on every hand, this thing
                        is certainâa knife will cut wood, and one cogged wheel will turn another.
                        This is sure.</p>
                    <p>Waldo found an immeasurable satisfaction in the handling of his machine; but
                        Doss winked and blinked, and thought it all frightfully<pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7167-175"/> monotonous out there on the flat, and presently
                        dropped asleep, sitting bolt upright. Suddenly his eyes opened wide;
                        something was coming from the direction of the homestead. Winking his eyes
                        and looking intently, he perceived it was the grey mare. Now Doss had
                        wondered much of late what had become of her master. Seeing she carried some
                        one on her back, he now came to his own conclusion, and began to move his
                        tail violently up and down. Presently he pricked up one ear and let the
                        other hang; his tail became motionless, and the expression of his mouth one
                        of decided disapproval bordering on scorn. He wrinkled his lips up on each
                        side into little lines.</p>
                    <p>The sand was soft, and the grey mare came on so noiselessly that the boy
                        heard nothing till Bonaparte dismounted. Then Doss got up and moved back a
                        step. He did not approve of Bonaparte's appearance. His costume, in truth,
                        was of a unique kind. It was a combination of<pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7167-176"/> the town and country. The tails of his black
                        cloth coat were pinned up behind to keep them from rubbing; he had on a pair
                        of moleskin trousers and leathern gaiters, and in his hand he carried a
                        little whip of rhinoceros hide.</p>
                    <p>Waldo started and looked up. Had there been a moment's time he would have dug
                        a hole in the sand with his hands and buried his treasure. It was only a
                        poor toy of wood, but he loved it, as one of necessity loves what has been
                        born of him.</p>
                    <p>âWhat have you here, my lad?â said Bonaparte, standing by him, and pointing
                        with the end of his whip to the medley of wheels and hinges.</p>
                    <p>The boy muttered something inaudible, and half-spread over the thing.</p>
                    <p>âBut this seems to be a very ingenious little machine,â said Bonaparte,
                        seating himself on the ant-heap, and bending down over it with deep
                        interest. âWhat is it for, my lad?â</p>
                    <pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7167-177"/>
                    <p>âShearing sheep.â</p>
                    <p>âIt is a very nice little machine,â said Bonaparte. âHow does it work, now? I
                        have never seen anything so ingenious!â</p>
                    <p>There was never a parent who heard deception in the voice that praised his
                        childâhis first-born. Here was one who liked the thing that had been created
                        in him. He forgot everything. He showed how the shears would work with a
                        little guidance, how the sheep would be held, and the wool fall into the
                        trough. A flush burst over his face as he spoke.</p>
                    <p>âI tell you what, my lad,â said Bonaparte emphatically, when the explanation
                        was finished, âwe must get you a patent. Your fortune is made. In three
                        years' time there'll not be a farm in this colony where it isn't working.
                        You're a genius, that's what <emph>you</emph> are!â said Bonaparte,
                        rising.</p>
                    <p>âIf it were made larger,â said the boy quickly, âit would work more smoothly.
                        Do you think<pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7167-178"/> there would be any one in
                        this colony would be able to make it?â</p>
                    <p>âI'm sure they could,â said Bonaparte; âand if not, why I'll do my best for
                        you. I'll send it to England. It must be done somehow. How long have you
                        worked at it?â</p>
                    <p>âNine months,â said the boy.</p>
                    <p>âOh, it is such a nice little machine,â said Bonaparte, âone can't help
                        feeling an interest in it. There is only <emph>one</emph> little
                        improvement, one very little improvement I should like to make.â</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte put his foot on the machine and crushed it into the sand. The boy
                        looked up into his face.</p>
                    <p>âLooks better now,â said Bonaparte, âdoesn't it? If we can't have it made in
                        England we'll send it to America. Good-bye; ta-ta,â he added. âYou're a
                        great genius, a born genius, my dear boy, there's no doubt about it.â</p>
                    <p>He mounted the grey mare and rode off.<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7167-179"/> The
                        dog watched his retreat with cynical satisfaction; but his master lay on the
                        ground with his head on his arms in the sand, and the little wheels and
                        chips of wood lay on the ground around him. The dog jumped on to his back
                        and snapped at the black curls, till, finding that no notice was taken, he
                        walked off to play with a black beetle. The beetle was hard at work trying
                        to roll home a great ball of dung it had been collecting all the morning:
                        but Doss broke the ball, and ate the beetle's hind legs, and then bit off
                        its head. And it was all play, and no one could tell what it had lived and
                        worked for. A striving, and a striving, and an ending in nothing.</p>

                    <p>â<hi rend="b">I HAVE</hi> found something in the loft,â said Em to Waldo, who
                        was listlessly piling cakes of fuel on the kraal wall, a week after his
                        father's death. âIt is a box of books that belonged to my father. We thought
                        Tant' Sannie had burnt them.â</p>
                    <p>The boy put down the cake he was raising and looked at her.</p>
                    <p>âI don't think they are very nice, not stories,â she added, âbut you can go
                        and take any you choose.â</p>
                    <p>So saying, she took up the plate in which she had brought his breakfast, and
                        walked off to the house.</p>
                    <p>After that the boy worked quickly. The pile<pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7167-181"/>
                        of fuel Bonaparte had ordered him to pack was on the wall in half an hour.
                        He then went to throw salt on the skins laid out to dry. Finding the pot
                        empty, he went to the loft to refill it.</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte Blenkins, whose door opened at the foot of the ladder, saw the boy
                        go up, and stood in the doorway waiting for his return. He wanted his boots
                        blacked. Doss, finding he could not follow his master up the round bars, sat
                        patiently at the foot of the ladder. Presently he looked up longingly, but
                        no one appeared. Then Bonaparte looked up also, and began to call; but there
                        was no answer. What could the boy be doing? The loft was an unknown land to
                        Bonaparte. He had often wondered what was up there; he liked to know what
                        was in all locked-up places and out-of-the-way corners, but the ladder he
                        could not scale. So Bonaparte looked up, and in the name of all that was
                        tantalizing, questioned what the boy did up there. The loft was used only as
                        a lumber-<pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7167-182"/> room. What could the fellow find
                        up there to keep him so long.</p>
                    <p>Could the Boer-woman have beheld Waldo at that instant, any lingering doubt
                        which might have remained in her mind as to the boy's insanity would
                        instantly have vanished. For, having filled the salt-pot, he proceeded to
                        look for the box of books among the rubbish that filled the loft. Under a
                        pile of sacks he found itâa rough packing-case, nailed up, but with one
                        loose plank. He lifted that, and saw the even backs of a row of books. He
                        knelt down before the box, and ran his hand along its rough edges, as if to
                        assure himself of its existence. He stuck his hand in among the books, and
                        pulled out two. He felt them, thrust his fingers in among the leaves, and
                        crumpled them a little, as a lover feels the hair of his mistress. The
                        fellow gloated over his treasure. He had had a dozen books in the course of
                        his life; now here was a mine of them opened at his feet.<pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7167-183"/> After a while he began to read the titles, and
                        now and again opened a book and read a sentence; but he was too excited to
                        catch the meanings distinctly. At last he came to a dull, brown volume. He
                        read the name, opened it in the centre, and where he opened began to read.
                        'Twas a chapter on property that he fell uponâCommunism, Fourierism, St.
                        Simonism, in a work on Political Economy. He read down one page and turned
                        over to the next; he read down that without changing his posture by an inch;
                        he read the next, and the next, kneeling up all the while with the book in
                        his hand, and his lips parted.</p>
                    <p>All he read he did not fully understand; the thoughts were new to him; but
                        this was the fellow's startled joy in the bookâthe thoughts were his, they
                        belonged to him. He had never thought them before, but they were his.</p>
                    <p>He laughed silently and internally, with the still intensity of triumphant
                        joy.</p>
                    <pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7167-184"/>
                    <p>So, then, all thinking creatures did not send up the one cryââAs thou, dear
                        Lord, has created things in the beginning, so are they now, so ought they to
                        be, so will they be, world without end; and it doesn't concern us what they
                        are. Amen.â There were men to whom not only kopjes and stones were calling
                        out imperatively, âWhat are we, and how came we here? Understand us, and
                        know us;â but to whom even the old, old relations between man and man, and
                        the customs of the ages called, and could not be made still and
                        forgotten.</p>
                    <p>The boy's heavy body quivered with excitement. So he was not alone, not
                        alone. He could not quite have told any one why he was so glad, and this
                        warmth had come to him. His cheeks were burning. No wonder that Bonaparte
                        called in vain, and Doss put his paws on the ladder, and whined till three
                        quarters of an hour had passed. At last the boy put the book in his breast
                        and buttoned it tightly to him.<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7167-185"/> He took up
                        the salt-pot, and went to the top of the ladder. Bonaparte, with his hands
                        folded under his coat-tails, looked up when he appeared, and accosted
                        him.</p>
                    <p>âYou've been rather a long time up there, my lad,â he said, as the boy
                        descended with a tremulous haste, most unlike his ordinary slow movements.
                        âYou didn't hear me calling, I suppose?â</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte whisked the tails of his coat up and down as he looked at him. He,
                        Bonaparte Blenkins, had eyes which were very far-seeing. He looked at the
                        pot. It was rather a small pot to have taken three-quarters of an hour in
                        the filling. He looked at the face. It was flushed. And yet, Tant' Sannie
                        kept no wineâhe had not been drinking; his eyes were wide open and brightâhe
                        had not been sleeping; there was no girl up thereâhe had not been making
                        love. Bonaparte looked at him sagaciously. What would account for the
                        marvellous change in the<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7167-186"/> boy coming down
                        the ladder from the boy going up the ladder? <emph>One</emph> thing there
                        was. Did not Tant' Sannie keep in the loft âbultongs,â and nice smoked
                        sausages? There must be something nice to <emph>eat</emph> up there! Aha!
                        that was it!</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte was so interested in carrying out this chain of inductive reasoning
                        that he quite forgot to have his boots blacked.</p>
                    <p>He watched the boy shuffle off with the salt-pot under his arm; then he stood
                        in his doorway and raised his eyes to the quiet blue sky, and audibly
                        propounded this riddle to himself:</p>
                    <p>âWhat is the connection between the naked back of a certain boy with a great
                        coat on and a salt-pot under his arm, and the tip of a horsewhip? Answer: No
                        connection at present, but there will be soon.â</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte was so pleased with this sally of his wit that he chuckled a
                        little, and went to lie down on his bed.</p>
                    <p>There was bread-baking that afternoon, and<pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7167-187"/>
                        there was a fire lighted in the brick oven behind the house, and Tant'
                        Sannie had left the great wooden-elbowed chair in which she passed her life,
                        and waddled out to look at it. Not far off was Waldo, who, having thrown a
                        pail of food into the pig-sty, now leaned over the sod-wall looking at the
                        pigs. Half of the sty was dry, but the lower half was a pool of mud, on the
                        edge of which the mother sow lay with closed eyes, her ten little ones
                        sucking; the father pig, knee-deep in the mud, stood running his snout into
                        a rotten pumpkin and wriggling his curled tail.</p>
                    <p>Waldo wondered dreamily as he stared why they were pleasant to look at. Taken
                        singly they were not beautiful; taken together they were. Was it not because
                        there was a certain harmony about them? The old sow was suited to the little
                        pigs, and the little pigs to their mother, the old boar to the rotten
                        pumpkin, and all to the mud. They suggested the thought of<pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7167-188"/> nothing that should be added, of nothing that
                        should be taken away. And, he wondered on vaguely, was not <emph>that</emph>
                        the secret of all beauty, that you who look onâ. So he stood dreaming, and
                        leaned further and further over the sod-wall, and looked at the pigs.</p>
                    <p>All this time Bonaparte Blenkins was sloping down from the house in an
                        aimless sort of way; but he kept one eye fixed on the pig-sty, and each
                        gyration brought him nearer to it. Waldo stood like a thing asleep when
                        Bonaparte came close up to him.</p>
                    <p>In old days, when a small boy, playing in an Irish street-gutter, he,
                        Bonaparte, had been familiarly known among his comrades under the title of
                        Tripping-Ben; this from the rare ease and dexterity with which, by merely
                        projecting his foot, he could precipitate any unfortunate companion on to
                        the crown of his head. Years had elapsed, and Tripping-Ben had become
                        Bonaparte; but the old gift was in him still. He<pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7167-189"/> came close to the pig-sty. All the defunct
                        memories of his boyhood returned on him in a flood, as, with an adroit
                        movement, he inserted his leg between Waldo and the wall, and sent him over
                        into the pig-sty.</p>
                    <p>The little pigs were startled at the strange intruder, and ran behind their
                        mother, who sniffed at him. Tant' Sannie smote her hands together and
                        laughed; but Bonaparte was far from joining her. Lost in reverie, he gazed
                        at the distant horizon.</p>
                    <p>The sudden reversal of head and feet had thrown out the volume that Waldo
                        carried in his breast. Bonaparte picked it up, and began to inspect it, as
                        the boy climbed slowly over the wall. He would have walked off sullenly, but
                        he wanted his book, and he waited until it should be given him.</p>
                    <p>âHa!â said Bonaparte, raising his eyes from the leaves of the book which he
                        was examining. âI hope your coat has not been injured; it is of<pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7167-190"/> an elegant cut. An heirloom, I presume, from your
                        paternal grandfather? It looks nice now.â</p>
                    <p>âOh, Lord! oh! Lord!â cried Tant' Sannie, laughing and holding her sides;
                        âhow the child looksâas though he thought the mud would never wash off. Oh,
                        Lord, I shall die! You, Bonaparte, are the funniest man I ever saw.â</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte Blenkins was now carefully inspecting the volume he had picked up.
                        Among the subjects on which the darkness of his understanding had been
                        enlightened during his youth, Political Economy had not been one. He was
                        not, therefore, very clear as to what the nature of the book might be; and
                        as the name of the writer, J.S. Mill, might, for anything he knew to the
                        contrary, have belonged to a venerable member of the British and Foreign
                        Bible Society, it by no means threw light upon the question. He was not in
                        any way sure that Political<pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7167-191"/> Economy had
                        nothing to do with the cheapest way of procuring clothing for the army and
                        navy, which would be certainly both a political and economical subject.</p>
                    <p>But Bonaparte soon came to a conclusion as to the nature of the book and its
                        contents, by the application of a simple rule now largely acted upon, but
                        which, becoming universal, would save much thought and valuable time. It is
                        of marvellous simplicity, of infinite utility, of universal applicability.
                        It may easily be committed to memory and runs thus:â</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>Whenever you come into contact with any book, person, or opinion of
                            which you absolutely comprehend nothing, declare that book, person or
                            opinion to be immoral. Bespatter it, vituperate against it, strongly
                            insist that any man or woman harbouring it is a fool or a knave, or
                            both. Carefully abstain from studying it. Do all that in you lies to
                            annihilate that book, person, or opinion.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Acting on this rule, so wide in its <choice>
                            <orig>comprehen-</orig>
                            <reg>comprehensiveness</reg>
                        </choice><pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7167-192"/> siveness, so beautifully simple
                        in its working, Bonaparte approached Tant' Sannie with the book in his hand.
                        Waldo came a step nearer, eyeing it like a dog whose young has fallen into
                        evil hands.</p>
                    <p>âThis book,â said Bonaparte, âis not a fit and proper study for a young and
                        immature mind.â</p>
                    <p>Tant' Sannie did not understand a word, and said,</p>
                    <p>âWhat?â</p>
                    <p>âThis book,â said Bonaparte, bringing down his finger with energy on the
                        cover, âthis book is <foreign xml:lang="unk">sleg, sleg, Davel, Davel</foreign>!â</p>
                    <p>Tant' Sannie perceived from the gravity of his countenance that it was no
                        laughing matter. From the words <foreign xml:lang="unk">sleg</foreign> and
                            <foreign xml:lang="unk">Davel</foreign> she understood that the book was evil, and had
                        some connection with the prince who pulls the wires of evil over the whole
                        earth.</p>
                    <p>âWhere did you get this book?â she asked,<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7167-193"/>
                        turning her twinkling little eyes on Waldo. âI wish that my legs may be as
                        thin as an Englishman's if it isn't one of your father's. He had more sins
                        than all the Kaffirs in Kaffirland, for all that he pretended to be so good
                        all those years, and to live without a wife because he was thinking of the
                        one that was dead! As though ten dead wives could make up for one fat one
                        with arms and legs!â cried Tant' Sannie, snorting.</p>
                    <p>âIt was not my father's book,â said the boy savagely. âI got it from your
                        loft.â</p>
                    <p>âMy loft! my book! How dare you?â cried Tant' Sannie.</p>
                    <p>âIt was Em's father's. She gave it me,â he muttered more sullenly.</p>
                    <p>âGive it here. What is the name of it? What is it about?â she asked, putting
                        her finger upon the title.</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte understood.</p>
                    <p>âPolitical Economy,â he said slowly.</p>
                    <pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7167-194"/>
                    <p>âDear Lord!â said Tant' Sannie, âcannot one hear from the very sound what an
                        ungodly book it is! One can hardly say the name. Haven't we got curses
                        enough on this farm?â cried Tant' Sannie, eloquently; âmy best imported
                        Merino ram dying of nobody knows what, and the short-horn cow casting her
                        two calves, and the sheep eaten up with the scab and the drought? And is
                            <emph>this</emph> a time to bring ungodly things about the place, to
                        call down the vengeance of Almighty God to punish us more? Didn't the
                        minister tell me when I was confirmed not to read any book except my Bible
                        and hymn-book, that the Devil was in all the rest? And I never have read any
                        other book,â said Tant' Sannie with virtuous energy, âand I never will!â</p>
                    <p>Waldo saw that the fate of his book was sealed, and turned sullenly on his
                        heel.</p>
                    <p>âSo you will not stay to hear what I say!â cried Tant' Sannie. âThere, take
                        your polity-gollity-gominy, your devil's book!â she cried,<pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7167-195"/> flinging the book at his head with much
                        energy.</p>
                    <p>It merely touched his forehead on one side and fell to the ground.</p>
                    <p>âGo on,â she cried; âI know you are going to talk to yourself. People who
                        talk to themselves always talk to the Devil. Go and tell him all about it.
                        Go, go! run!â cried Tant' Sannie.</p>
                    <p>But the boy neither quickened nor slackened his pace, and passed sullenly
                        round the back of the waggon-house.</p>
                    <p>Books have been thrown at other heads before and since that summer afternoon,
                        by hands more white and delicate than those of the Boer-woman; but whether
                        the result of the process has been in any case wholly satisfactory, may be
                        questioned. We love that with a peculiar tenderness, we treasure it with a
                        peculiar care, it has for us quite a fictitious value, for which we have
                        suffered. If we may not carry it anywhere<pb n="193" xml:id="VAB7167-196"/>
                        else we will carry it in our hearts, and always to the end.</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte Blenkins went to pick up the volume, now loosened from its cover,
                        while Tant' Sannie pushed the stumps of wood further into the oven.
                        Bonaparte came close to her, tapped the book knowingly, nodded, and looked
                        at the fire. Tant' Sannie comprehended, and, taking the volume from his
                        hand, threw it into the back of the oven. It lay upon the heap of coals,
                        smoked, flared, and blazed, and the âPolitical Economyâ was no moreâgone out
                        of existence, like many another poor heretic of flesh and blood.</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte grinned, and to watch the process brought his face so near the oven
                        door that the white hair on his eyebrows got singed. He then inquired if
                        there were any more in the loft. Learning that there were, he made signs
                        indicative of taking up armfuls and flinging them into the fire. But Tant'
                        Sannie was dubious. The<pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7167-197"/> deceased
                        Englishman had left all his personal effects specially to his child. It was
                        all very well for Bonaparte to talk of burning the books. He had had his
                        hair spiritually pulled, and she had no wish to repeat his experience.</p>
                    <p>She shook her head. Bonaparte was displeased. But then a happy thought
                        occurred to him. He suggested that the key of the loft should henceforth be
                        put into his own safe care and keepingâno one gaining possession of it
                        without his permission. To this Tant' Sannie readily assented, and the two
                        walked lovingly to the house to look for it.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
                    <head type="sub">HE BITES.</head>
                    <p><hi rend="b">BONAPARTE BLENKINS</hi> was riding home on the grey mare. He had
                        ridden out that afternoon, partly for the benefit of his health, partly to
                        maintain his character as overseer of the farm. As he rode on slowly, he
                        thoughtfully touched the ears of the grey mare with his whip.</p>
                    <p>âNo, Bon, my boy,â he addressed himself, âdon't propose! You can't marry for
                        four years, then why propose? Wheedle her, tweedle her, teedle her, but
                            <emph>don't</emph> let her make sure of you. When a woman,â said
                        Bonaparte, sagely resting his finger against the side of his nose, âwhen a
                        woman is sure of you she does what she likes with you; but when she isn't,
                        you do what you like with her. And Iââ said Bonaparte.</p>
                    <pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7167-199"/>
                    <p>Here he drew the horse up suddenly and looked. He was now close to the house,
                        and leaning over the pigsty wall, in company with Em, who was showing her
                        the pigs, was a strange female figure. It was the first visitor that had
                        appeared on the farm since his arrival, and he looked at her with interest.
                        She was a tall, pudgy girl of fifteen, weighing a hundred and fifty pounds,
                        with baggy pendulous cheeks and up-turned nose. She strikingly resembled
                        Tant' Sannie in form and feature, but her sleepy good eyes lacked that
                        twinkle that dwelt in the Boer-woman's small orbs. She was attired in a
                        bright green print, wore brass rings in her ears and glass beads round her
                        neck, and was sucking the tip of her large finger as she looked at the
                        pigs.</p>
                    <p>âWho is it that has come?â asked Bonaparte, when he stood drinking his coffee
                        in the front room.</p>
                    <p>âWhy, my niece, to be sure,â said Tant'<pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7167-200"/>
                        Sannie, the Hottentot maid translating. âShe's the only daughter of my only
                        brother Paul, and she's come to visit me. She'll be a nice mouthful to the
                        man that can get her,â added Tant' Sannie. âHer father's got two thousand
                        pounds in the green waggon box under his bed, and a farm, and five thousand
                        sheep, and God Almighty knows how many goats and horses. They milk ten cows
                        in mid winter, and the young men are after her like flies about a bowl of
                        milk. She says she means to get married in about four months, but she
                        doesn't yet know to whom. It was so with me when I was young,â said Tant'
                        Sannie. âI've sat up with the young men four and five nights a week. And
                        they will come riding again as soon as ever they know that the time's up
                        that the Englishman made me agree not to marry in.â</p>
                    <p>The Boer-woman smirked complacently.</p>
                    <p>âWhere are you going to?â asked Tant' Sannie presently, seeing that Bonaparte
                        rose.</p>
                    <pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7167-201"/>
                    <p>âHa! I'm just going to the kraals; I'll be in to supper,â said Bonaparte.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, when he reached his own door he stopped and turned in there.
                        Soon after he stood before the little glass, arrayed in his best white shirt
                        with the little tucks, and shaving himself. He had on his very best
                        trousers, and had heavily oiled the little fringe at the back of his head,
                        which, however, refused to become darker. But what distressed him most was
                        his noseâit was very red. He rubbed his finger and thumb on the wall, and
                        put a little whitewash on it; but, finding it rather made matters worse, he
                        rubbed it off again. Then he looked carefully into his own eyes. They
                        certainly were a little pulled down at the outer corners, which gave them
                        the appearance of looking cross-wise; but then they were a nice blue. So he
                        put on his best coat, took up his stick, and went out to supper, feeling on
                        the whole well satisfied.</p>
                    <p>âAunt,â said Trana to Tant' Sannie when<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7167-202"/>
                        that night they lay together in the great wooden bed, âwhy does the
                        Englishman sigh so when he looks at me?â</p>
                    <p>âHa!â said Tant' Sannie, who was half asleep, but suddenly started, wide
                        awake. âIt's because he thinks you look like me. I tell you, Trana,â said
                        Tant' Sannie, âthe man is mad with love of me. I told him the other night I
                        couldn't marry till Em was sixteen, or I'd lose all the sheep her father
                        left me. And he talked about Jacob working seven years and seven years again
                        for his wife. And of course he meant me,â said Tant' Sannie pompously. âBut
                        he won't get me so easily as he thinks; he'll have to ask more than
                        once.â</p>
                    <p>âOh!â said Trana, who was a lumpish girl and not much given to talking; but
                        presently she added, âAunt, why does the Englishman always knock against you
                        when he passes you?â</p>
                    <p>âThat's because you are always in the way,â said Tant' Sannie.</p>
                    <pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7167-203"/>
                    <p>âBut, aunt, said Trana, presently, âI think he is very ugly.â</p>
                    <p>âPhugh!â said Tant' Sannie. It's only because we're not accustomed to such
                        noses in this country. In his country he says all the people have such
                        noses, and the redder your nose is the higher you are. He's of the family of
                        the Queen, Victoria, you know,â said Tant' Sannie, wakening up with her
                        subject; âand he doesn't think anything of governors and Church elders, and
                        such people; they are nothing to him. When his aunt with the dropsy dies
                        he'll have money enough to buy all the farms in this district!â</p>
                    <p>âOh!â said Trana. That certainly made a difference.</p>
                    <p>âYes,â said Tant' Sannie; âand he's only forty-one, though you'd take him to
                        be sixty. And he told me last night the real reason of his baldness.â</p>
                    <p>Tant' Sannie then proceeded to relate how, at<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7167-204"/> eighteen years of age, Bonaparte had courted a fair young lady. How a
                        deadly rival, jealous of his verdant locks, his golden flowing hair, had,
                        with a damnable and insinuating deception, made him a present of a pot of
                        pomatum. How applying it in the evening, on rising in the morning he found
                        his pillow strewn with the golden locks, and, looking into the glass, beheld
                        the shining and smooth expanse which henceforth he must bear. The few
                        remaining hairs were turned to a silvery whiteness, and the young lady
                        married his rival.</p>
                    <p>âAnd,â said Tant' Sannie solemnly, âif it had not been for the grace of God,
                        and reading of the psalms, he says he would have killed himself. He says he
                        could kill himself quite easily if he wants to marry a woman and she
                        won't.â</p>
                    <p>âAll the world!â said Trana: and then they went to sleep.</p>
                    <p>Every one was lost in sleep soon; but from the window of the cabin the light
                            streamed<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7167-205"/> forth. It came from a dung
                        fire, over which Waldo sat brooding. Hour after hour he sat there, now and
                        again throwing a fresh lump of fuel on to the fire, which burnt up bravely,
                        and then sank into a great bed of red coals, which reflected themselves in
                        the boy's eyes as he sat there brooding, brooding, brooding. At last, when
                        the fire was blazing at its brightest, he rose suddenly and walked slowly to
                        a beam from which an ox â<choice>
                            <sic>riem</sic>
                            <corr>reim</corr>
                        </choice>â hung. Loosening it, he ran a noose in one end and then doubled it
                        round his arm.</p>
                    <p>âMine, mine! I have a right,â he muttered; and then something louder, âif I
                        fall and am killed, so much the better!â</p>
                    <p>He opened the door and went out into the starlight.</p>
                    <p>He walked with his eyes bent upon the ground, but over-head it was one of
                        those brilliant southern nights when every space so small that your hand
                        might cover it shows fifty cold white points, and the milky-way is a belt of
                            sharp<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7167-206"/> frosted silver. He passed the
                        door where Bonaparte lay dreaming of Trana and her wealth, and he mounted
                        the ladder steps. From those he clambered with some difficulty on to the
                        roof of the house. It was of old rotten thatch with a ridge of white
                        plaster, and it crumbled away under his feet at every step. He trod as
                        heavily as he could. So much the better if he fell!</p>
                    <p>He knelt down when he got to the far gable, and began to fasten his â<choice>
                            <sic>riem</sic>

                        </choice>â to the crumbling bricks. Below was the little window of the loft.
                        With one end of the â<choice>
                            <sic>riem</sic>
                            <corr>reim</corr>
                        </choice>â tied round the gable, the other end round his waist, how easy to
                        slide down to it, and to open it, through one of the broken panes, and to go
                        in, and to fill his arms with books, and to clamber up again! They had burnt
                        one bookâhe would have twenty. Every man's hand was against hisâhis should
                        be against every man's. No one would help himâhe would help himself.</p>
                    <p>He lifted the black damp hair from his knit<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7167-207"/>
                        forehead, and looked round to cool his hot face. Then he saw what a regal
                        night it was. He knelt silently and looked up. A thousand eyes were looking
                        down at him, bright and so cold. There was a laughing irony in them.</p>
                    <p>âSo hot, so bitter, so angry? Poor little mortal!â</p>
                    <p>He was ashamed. He folded his arms, and sat on the ridge of the roof looking
                        up at them.</p>
                    <p>â<emph>So</emph> hot, <emph>so</emph> bitter, <emph>so</emph> angry?â</p>
                    <p>It was as though a cold hand had been laid upon his throbbing forehead, and
                        slowly they began to fade and grow dim. Tant' Sannie and the burnt book,
                        Bonaparte and the broken machine, the box in the loft, he himself sitting
                        thereâhow small they all became! Even the grave over yonder. Those stars
                        that shone on up above so quietly, they had seen a thousand such little
                        existences fight just so fiercely, flare up just so<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7167-208"/> brightly, and go out; and they, the old, old
                        stars, shone on forever.</p>
                    <p>âSo hot, so angry, poor little soul?â they said.</p>
                    <p>The â<choice>

                        up.</p>
                    <p>âWe,â said the stars, âhave seen the earth when it was young. We have seen
                        small things creep out upon its surfaceâsmall things that prayed and loved
                        and cried very loudly, and then crept under it again. But we,â said the
                        stars, âare as old as the Unknown.â</p>
                    <p>He leaned his chin against the palm of his hand and looked up at them. So
                        long he sat there that bright stars set and new ones rose, and yet he sat
                        on.</p>
                    <p>Then at last he stood up, and began to loosen the â<choice>

                        </choice>â from the gable.</p>
                    <p>What did it matter about the books? The lust and the desire for them had died
                        out. If they pleased to keep them from him they might.<pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7167-209"/> What matter? it was a very little thing. Why
                        hate, and struggle, and fight? Let it be as it would.</p>
                    <p>He twisted the â<choice>
                            <sic>riem</sic>

                    <p>By this time Bonaparte Blenkins had finished his dream of Trana, and as he
                        turned himself round for a fresh doze he heard the steps descending the
                        ladder. His first impulse was to draw the blanket over his head and his legs
                        under him, and to howl; but recollecting that the door was locked and the
                        window carefully bolted, he allowed his head slowly to crop out among the
                        blankets, and listened intently. Whosoever it might be, there was no danger
                        of their getting at him; so he clambered out of bed, and going on tiptoe to
                        the door, applied his eye to the keyhole. There was nothing to be seen; so
                        walking to the window, he brought his face as close to the glass as his nose
                        would allow. There was a figure just discernible. The lad<pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7167-210"/> was not trying to walk softly, and the heavy
                        shuffling of the well-known âvel-schoensâ could be clearly heard through the
                        closed window as they crossed the stones in the yard. Bonaparte listened
                        till they had died away round the corner of the waggon-house; and, feeling
                        that his bare legs were getting cold, he jumped back into bed again.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="*   *   *   *   *"/>
                    <p>âWhat do you keep up in your loft?â inquired Bonaparte of the Boer-woman the
                        next evening, pointing upwards and elucidating his meaning by the addition
                        of such Dutch words as he knew, for the lean Hottentot was gone home.</p>
                    <p>âDried skins,â said the Boer-woman, âand empty bottles, and boxes, and sacks,
                        and soap.â</p>
                    <p>âYou don't keep any of your provisions thereâsugar, now?â said Bonaparte,
                        pointing to the sugar-basin and then up at the loft.</p>
                    <p>Tant' Sannie shook her head.</p>
                    <pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7167-211"/>
                    <p>âOnly salt, and dried peaches.â</p>
                    <p>âDried peaches! Eh?â said Bonaparte. âShut the door, my dear child, shut it
                        tight,â he called out to Em, who stood in the dining-room. Then he leaned
                        over the elbow of the sofa and brought his face as close as possible to the
                        Boer-woman's, and made signs of eating. Then he said something she did not
                        comprehend; then said, âWaldo, Waldo, Waldo,â pointed up to the loft, and
                        made signs of eating again.</p>
                    <p>Now an inkling of his meaning dawned on the Boer-woman's mind. To make it
                        clearer, he moved his legs after the manner of one going up a ladder,
                        appeared to be opening a door, masticated vigorously, said, âPeaches,
                        peaches, peaches,â and appeared to be coming down the ladder.</p>
                    <p>It was now evident to Tant' Sannie that Waldo had been in her loft and eaten
                        her peaches.</p>
                    <p>To exemplify his own share in the proceedings,<pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7167-212"/> Bonaparte lay down on the sofa, and shutting his
                        eyes tightly, said, âNight, night, night!â Then he sat up wildly, appearing
                        to be intently listening, mimicked with his feet the coming down a ladder,
                        and looked at Tant' Sannie. This clearly showed how, roused in the night, he
                        had discovered the theft.</p>
                    <p>âHe must have been a great fool to eat my peaches,â said Tant' Sannie. âThey
                        are full of mites as a sheepskin, and as hard as stones.â</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte, fumbling in his pocket, did not even hear her remark, and took out
                        from his coat-tail a little horsewhip, nicely rolled up. Bonaparte winked at
                        the little rhinoceros horsewhip, at the Boer-woman, and then at the
                        door.</p>
                    <p>âShall we call himâWaldo, Waldo?â he said.</p>
                    <p>Tant' Sannie nodded, and giggled. There was something so exceedingly humorous
                        in the idea that he was going to beat the boy, though for her own part she
                        did not see that the peaches<pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7167-213"/> were worth
                        it. When the Kaffir maid came with the wash-tub she was sent to summon
                        Waldo; and Bonaparte doubled up the little whip and put it in his pocket.
                        Then he drew himself up, and prepared to act his important part with
                        becoming gravity. Soon Waldo stood in the door, and took off his hat.</p>
                    <p>âCome in, come in, my lad,â said Bonaparte, âand shut the door behind.â</p>
                    <p>The boy came in and stood before them.</p>
                    <p>âYou need not be so afraid, child,â said Tant' Sannie. âI was a child myself
                        once. It's no great harm if you have taken a few.â</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte perceived that her remark was not in keeping with the nature of the
                        proceedings, and of the little drama he intended to act. Pursing out his
                        lips, and waving his hand, he solemnly addressed the boy.</p>
                    <p>âWaldo, it grieves me beyond expression to have to summon you for so painful
                        a purpose; but it is at the imperative call of duty, which I<pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7167-214"/> dare not evade. I do not state that frank and
                        unreserved confession will obviate the necessity of chastisement, which if
                        requisite shall be fully administered; but the nature of that chastisement
                        may be mitigated by free and humble confession. Waldo, answer me as you
                        would your own father, in whose place I now stand to you; have you, or have
                        you not, did you, or did you not, eat of the peaches in the loft?â</p>
                    <p>âSay you took them, boy, say you took them, then he won't beat you so much,â
                        said the Dutch-woman, good-naturedly, getting a little sorry for him.</p>
                    <p>The boy raised his eyes slowly and fixed them vacantly upon her, then
                        suddenly his face grew dark with blood.</p>
                    <p>â<emph>So</emph>, you haven't got anything to say to us, my lad?â said
                        Bonaparte, momentarily forgetting his dignity, and bending forward with a
                        little snarl. âBut what I mean is just this, my ladâwhen it takes a boy
                        three-quarters of an<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7167-215"/> hour to fill a
                        salt-pot, and when at three o'clock in the morning he goes knocking about
                        the doors of a loft, it's natural to suppose there's mischief in it. It's
                        certain there <emph>is</emph> mischief in it; and where there's mischief
                            <emph>in</emph> it must be taken <emph>out</emph>,â said Bonaparte,
                        grinning into the boy's face. Then, feeling that he had fallen from that
                        high gravity which was as spice to the pudding, and the flavour of the whole
                        little tragedy, he drew himself up. âWaldo,â he said, âconfess to me
                        instantly, and without reserve, that you ate the peaches.â</p>
                    <p>The boy's face was white now. His eyes were on the ground, his hands doggedly
                        clasped before him.</p>
                    <p>âWhat, do you not intend to answer?â</p>
                    <p>The boy looked up at them once from under his bent eyebrows, and then looked
                        down again.</p>
                    <p>âThe creature looks as if all the devils in hell were in it,â cried Tant'
                        Sannie. âSay you took them, boy. Young things will be young things,<pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7167-216"/> I was older than you when I used to eat
                        âbultongâ in my mother's loft, and get the little niggers whipped for it.
                        Say you took them.â</p>
                    <p>But the boy said nothing.</p>
                    <p>âI think a little solitary confinement might perhaps be beneficial,â said
                        Bonaparte. âIt will enable you, Waldo, to reflect on the enormity of the sin
                        you have committed against our Father in heaven. And you may also think of
                        the submission you owe to those who are older and wiser than you are, and
                        whose duty it is to check and correct you.â</p>
                    <p>Saying this, Bonaparte stood up and took down the key of the fuel-house,
                        which hung on a nail against the wall.</p>
                    <p>âWalk on, my boy,â said Bonaparte, pointing to the door; and as he followed
                        him out he drew his mouth expressively on one side, and made the lash of the
                        little horsewhip stick out of his pocket and shake up and down.</p>
                    <p>Tant' Sannie felt half sorry for the lad; but<pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7167-217"/> she could not help laughing, it was always so funny when one was going to
                        have a whipping, and it would do him good. Anyhow, he would forget all about
                        it when the places were healed.</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte took up a lighted candle that had been left burning on the kitchen
                        table, and told the boy to walk before him. They went to the fuel-house. It
                        was a little stone erection that jutted out from the side of the
                        waggon-house. It was low, and without a window; and the dried dung was piled
                        in one corner, and the coffee-mill stood in another, fastened on the top of
                        a post. Bonaparte took the padlock off the rough door.</p>
                    <p>âWalk in, my lad,â he said.</p>
                    <p>Waldo obeyed sullenly; one place to him was much the same as another. He had
                        no objection to being locked up.</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte followed him in, and closed the door carefully. He put the light
                        down on the heap of dung in the corner, and quietly <choice>

                        </choice><pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7167-218"/> duced his hand under his
                        coat-tails, and drew slowly from his pocket the end of a rope, which he
                        concealed behind him.</p>
                    <p>âI'm very sorry, exceedingly sorry, Waldo, my lad, that you should have acted
                        in this manner. It grieves me,â said Bonaparte.</p>
                    <p>He moved round toward the boy's back. He hardly liked the look in the
                        fellow's eyes, though he stood there motionless. If he should spring on
                        him!</p>
                    <p>So he drew the rope out very carefully, and shifted round to the wooden post.
                        There was a slip-knot in one end of the rope, and a sudden movement drew the
                        boy's hands to his back and passed it round them. It was an instant's work
                        to drag it twice round the wooden post: then Bonaparte was safe.</p>
                    <p>For a moment the boy struggled to free himself; then he knew that he was
                        powerless, and stood still.</p>
                    <p>âHorses that kick must have their legs tied,â<pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7167-219"/> said Bonaparte, as he passed the other end of the rope round the boy's
                        knees. âAnd now, my dear Waldo,â taking the whip out of his pocket, âI am
                        going to beat you.â</p>
                    <p>He paused for a moment. It was perfectly quiet; they could hear each other's
                        breath.</p>
                    <p>ââChasten thy son while there is hope,ââ said Bonaparte, ââand let not thy
                        soul spare for his crying.â Those are God's words. I shall act as a father
                        to you, Waldo. I think we had better have your naked back.â</p>
                    <p>He took out his pen-knife, and slit the shirt down from the shoulder to the
                        waist.</p>
                    <p>âNow,â said Bonaparte, âI hope the Lord will bless and sanctify to you what I
                        am going to do to you.â</p>
                    <p>The first cut ran from the shoulder across the middle of the back; the second
                        fell exactly in the same place. A shudder passed through the boy's
                        frame.</p>
                    <p>âNice, eh?â said Bonaparte, peeping round<pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7167-220"/>
                        into his face, speaking with a lisp, as though to a very little child.
                            â<hi>Nith, eh?</hi>â</p>
                    <p>But the eyes were black and lustreless, and seemed not to see him. When he
                        had given sixteen Bonaparte paused in his work to wipe a little drop of
                        blood from his whip.</p>
                    <p>âCold, eh? What makes you shiver so? Perhaps you would like to pull up your
                        shirt? But I've not quite done yet.â</p>
                    <p>When he had finished he wiped the whip again, and put it back in his pocket.
                        He cut the rope through with his pen-knife, and then took up the light.</p>
                    <p>âYou don't seem to have found your tongue yet. Forgotten how to cry?â said
                        Bonaparte, patting him on the cheek.</p>
                    <p>The boy looked up at himânot sullenly, not angrily. There was only a wild,
                        fitful terror in the eyes. Bonaparte made haste to go out and shut the door,
                        and leave him alone in the darkness. He himself was afraid.</p>

                    <p>It was almost morning. Waldo lay with his face upon the ground at the foot of
                        the fuel-heap. There was a round hole near the top of the door, where a knot
                        of wood had fallen out, and a stream of grey light came in through it.</p>
                    <p>Ah, it was going to end at last. Nothing lasts forever, not even the night.
                        How was it he had never thought of that before? For in all that long dark
                        night he had been very strong, had never been tired, never felt pain, had
                        run on and on, up and down, up and down; he had not dared to stand still,
                        and he had not known it would end. He had been so strong, that when he
                        struck his head with all his force upon the stone wall it did not stun him
                        nor pain himâonly made him laugh. That was a dreadful night. When he clasped
                        his hands frantically and prayedââO God, my beautiful God, my sweet God,
                        once, only once, let me feel you near me to-night!â he could not feel Him.
                            He<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7167-222"/> prayed aloud, very loud, and he got
                        no answer; when he listened it was all quite quietâlike when the priests of
                        Baal cried aloud to their godââOh, Baal, hear us! Oh, Baal, hear us!â But
                        Baal was gone a-hunting.</p>
                    <p>That was a long wild night, and wild thoughts came and went in it; but they
                        left their marks behind them forever: for as years cannot pass without
                        leaving their traces behind them, neither can nights into which are forced
                        the thoughts and sufferings of years. And now the dawn was coming, and at
                        last he was very tired. He shivered, and tried to draw the shirt up over his
                        shoulders. They were getting stiff now. He had never known they were cut in
                        the night. He looked up at the white light that came in through the hole at
                        the top of the door and shuddered. Then he turned his face back to the
                        ground, and slept again.</p>
                    <p>Some hours later Bonaparte came toward the fuel-house with a lump of bread in
                        his hand.<pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7167-223"/> He opened the door and peered
                        in; then entered, and touched the fellow with his boot. Seeing that he
                        breathed heavily, though he did not rouse, Bonaparte threw the bread down on
                        the ground. He was alive, that was one thing. He bent over him, and
                        carefully scratched open one of the cuts with the nail of his forefinger,
                        examining with much interest his last night's work. He would have to count
                        his sheep himself that day; the boy was literally cut up. He locked the door
                        and went away again.</p>
                    <p>âOh, Lyndall,â said Em, entering the dining room, and bathed in tears, that
                        afternoon, âI have been begging Bonaparte to let him out, and he won't.â</p>
                    <p>âThe more you beg the more he will not,â said Lyndall.</p>
                    <p>She was cutting out aprons on the table.</p>
                    <p>âOh, but it's late, and I think they want to kill him,â said Em, weeping
                        bitterly; and finding that no more consolation was to be<pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7167-224"/> gained from her cousin, she went off
                        blubberingââI wonder you can cut out aprons when Waldo is shut up like
                        that.â</p>
                    <p>For ten minutes after she was gone Lyndall worked on quietly; then she folded
                        up her stuff, rolled it tightly together, and stood before the closed door
                        of the sitting room with her hands closely clasped. A flush rose to her
                        face: she opened the door quickly, and walking in, went to the nail on which
                        the key of the fuel-room hung. Bonaparte and Tant' Sannie sat there and saw
                        her.</p>
                    <p>âWhat do you want?â they asked together.</p>
                    <p>âThis key,â she said, holding it up, and looking at them.</p>
                    <p>âDo you mean her to have it?â said Tant' Sannie in Dutch.</p>
                    <p>âWhy don't you stop her?â asked Bonaparte in English.</p>
                    <p>âWhy don't you take it from her?â said Tant' Sannie.</p>
                    <pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7167-225"/>
                    <p>So they looked at each other, talking, while Lyndall walked to the fuel-house
                        with the key, her underlip bitten in.</p>
                    <p>âWaldo,â she said, as she helped him to stand up, and twisted his arm about
                        her waist to support him, âwe will not be children always; we shall have the
                        power too some day.â She kissed his naked shoulder with her soft little
                        mouth. It was all the comfort her young soul could give him.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
                    <head type="sub">HE MAKES LOVE.</head>
                    <p>â<hi rend="b">HERE</hi>,â said Tant' Sannie to her Hottentot maid, âI have
                        been in this house four years, and never been up in the loft. Fatter women
                        than I go up ladders; I will go up to-day and see what it is like, and put
                        it to rights up there. You bring the little ladder and stand at the
                        bottom.â</p>
                    <p>âThere's one would be sorry if you were to fall,â said the Hottentot maid,
                        leering at Bonaparte's pipe, that lay on the table.</p>
                    <p>âHold your tongue, jade,â said her mistress, trying to conceal a pleased
                        smile, âand go fetch the ladder.â</p>
                    <p>There was a never-used trap-door at one end<pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7167-227"/>
                        of the sitting room: this the Hottentot maid pushed open, and setting the
                        ladder against it, the Boer-woman with some danger and difficulty climbed
                        into the loft. Then the Hottentot maid took the ladder away, as her husband
                        was mending the waggon-house, and needed it; but the trap-door was left
                        open.</p>
                    <p>For a little while Tant' Sannie poked about among the empty bottles and
                        skins, and looked at the bag of peaches that Waldo was supposed to have
                        liked so; then she sat down near the trap-door beside a barrel of salt
                        mutton. She found that the pieces of meat were much too large, and took out
                        her clasp-knife to divide them.</p>
                    <p>That was always the way when one left things to servants, she grumbled to
                        herself: but when once she was married to her husband Bonaparte it would not
                        matter whether a sheep spoiled or noâwhen once his rich aunt with the dropsy
                        was dead. She smiled as she dived her hand into the pickle water.</p>
                    <pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7167-228"/>
                    <p>At that instant her niece entered the room below, closely followed by
                        Bonaparte, with his head on one side, smiling mawkishly. Had Tant' Sannie
                        spoken at that moment the life of Bonaparte Blenkins would have run a wholly
                        different course; as it was, she remained silent, and neither noticed the
                        open trap-door above their heads.</p>
                    <p>âSit there, my love,â said Bonaparte, motioning Trana into her aunt's
                        elbow-chair, and drawing another close up in front of it, in which he seated
                        himself. âThere, put your feet upon the stove too. Your aunt has gone out
                        somewhere. Long have I waited for this auspicious event!â</p>
                    <p>Trana, who understood not one word of English, sat down in the chair and
                        wondered if this was one of the strange customs of other lands, that an old
                        gentleman may bring his chair up to yours, and sit with his knees touching
                        you. She had been five days in Bonaparte's<pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7167-229"/>
                        company, and feared the old man, and disliked his nose.</p>
                    <p>âHow long have I desired this moment!â said Bonaparte. âBut that aged
                        relative of thine is always casting her unhallowed shadow upon us. Look into
                        my eyes, Trana!â</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte knew that she comprehended not a syllable; but he understood that
                        it is the eye, the tone, the action, and not at all the rational word, that
                        touches the love-chords. He saw she changed colour.</p>
                    <p>âAll night,â said Bonaparte, âI lie awake; I see nought but thy angelic
                        countenance. I open my arms to receive theeâwhere art thou, where? Thou art
                        not there!â said Bonaparte, suiting the action to the words, and spreading
                        out his arms and drawing them to his breast.</p>
                    <p>âOh, please, I don't understand,â said Trana, âI want to go away.â</p>
                    <p>âYes, yes!â said Bonaparte, leaning back in his chair, to her great relief,
                        and pressing his<pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7167-230"/> hands on his heart,
                        âsince first thy amethystine countenance was impressed
                        <emph>here</emph>âwhat have I not suffered, what have I not felt? Oh, the
                        pangs unspoken, burning as an ardent coal in a fiery and uncontaminated
                        bosom!â said Bonaparte, bending forward again.</p>
                    <p>âDear Lord!â said Trana to herself, âhow foolish I have been! The old man has
                        a pain in his stomach, and now, as my aunt is out, he has come to me to help
                        him.â</p>
                    <p>She smiled kindly at Bonaparte, and pushing past him, went to the bedroom,
                        quickly returning with a bottle of red drops in her hand.</p>
                    <p>âThey are very good for âbenaawdheitâ; my mother always drinks them,â she
                        said, holding the bottle out.</p>
                    <p>The face in the trap-door was a fiery red. Like a tiger-cat ready to spring.
                        Tant' Sannie crouched, with the shoulder of mutton in her hand. Exactly
                        beneath her stood Bonaparte.<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7167-231"/> She rose and
                        clasped with both arms the barrel of salt meat.</p>
                    <p>âWhat, rose of the desert, nightingale of the colony, that with thine amorous
                        lay whilest the lonesome night!â cried Bonaparte, seizing the hand that held
                        the âvonlicsense.â âNay, struggle not! Fly as a stricken fawn into the arms
                        that would embrace thee, thouââ</p>
                    <p>Here a stream of cold pickle-water, heavy with ribs and shoulders, descending
                        on his head abruptly terminated his speech. Half-blinded, Bonaparte looked
                        up through the drops that hung from his eyelids, and saw the red face that
                        looked down at him. With one wild cry he fled. As he passed out at the front
                        door a shoulder of mutton, well-directed, struck the black coat in the small
                        of the back.</p>
                    <p>âBring the ladder! bring the ladder! I will go after him!â cried the
                        Boer-woman, as Bonaparte Blenkins wildly fled into the fields.</p>
                    <milestone unit="section" n="*   *   *   *   *"/>
                    <pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7167-232"/>
                    <p>Late in the evening of the same day Waldo knelt on the floor of his cabin. He
                        bathed the foot of his dog which had been pierced by a thorn. The bruises on
                        his own back had had five days to heal in, and, except a little stiffness in
                        his movements, there was nothing remarkable about the boy.</p>
                    <p>The troubles of the young are soon over; they leave no external mark. If you
                        wound the tree in its youth the bark will quickly cover the gash; but when
                        the tree is very old, peel the bark off, look carefully, and you will see
                        the scar there still. All that is buried is not dead.</p>
                    <p>Waldo poured the warm milk over the little swollen foot; Doss lay very quiet,
                        with tears in his eyes. Then there was a tap at the door. In an instant Doss
                        looked wide awake, and winked the tears out from between his little
                        lids.</p>
                    <p>âCome in,â said Waldo, intent on his work; and slowly and cautiously the door
                        opened.</p>
                    <p>âGood evening, Waldo, my boy,â said<pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7167-233"/>
                        Bonaparte Blenkins in a mild voice, not venturing more than his nose within
                        the door. âHow are you this evening?â</p>
                    <p>Doss growled and showed his little teeth, and tried to rise, but his paw hurt
                        him so, he whined.</p>
                    <p>âI'm very tired, Waldo, my boy,â said Bonaparte, plaintively.</p>
                    <p>Doss showed his little white teeth again. His master went on with his work
                        without looking round. There are some people at whose hands it is best not
                        to look. At last he said,</p>
                    <p>âCome in.â</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte stepped cautiously a little way into the room, and left the door
                        open behind him. He looked at the boy's supper on the table.</p>
                    <p>âWaldo, I've had nothing to eat all dayâI'm very hungry,â he said.</p>
                    <p>âEat!â said Waldo after a moment, bending lower over his dog.</p>
                    <p>âYou won't go and tell her that I am here, will<pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7167-234"/> you, Waldo?â said Bonaparte most uneasily.
                        âYou've heard how she used me, Waldo? I've been <emph>badly</emph> treated;
                        you'll know yourself what it is some day when you can't carry on a little
                        conversation with a lady without having salt meat and pickle-water thrown at
                        you. Waldo, look at me: do I look as a gentleman should?â</p>
                    <p>But the boy neither looked up nor answered, and Bonaparte grew more
                        uneasy.</p>
                    <p>âYou wouldn't go and tell her that I am here, would you?â said Bonaparte,
                        whiningly. âThere's no knowing what she would do to me. I've such trust in
                        you, Waldo; I've always thought you such a promising lad, though you mayn't
                        have known it, Waldo.â</p>
                    <p>âEat,â said the boy. âI shall say nothing.â</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte, who knew the truth when another spoke it, closed the door,
                        carefully putting on the button. Then he looked to see that the curtain of
                        the window was closely pulled down, and seated himself at the table. He was
                            soon<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7167-235"/> munching the cold meat and bread.
                        Waldo knelt on the floor, bathing the foot with hands which the dog licked
                        lovingly. Once only he glanced at the table, and turned away quickly.</p>
                    <p>âAh, yes; I don't wonder that you can't look at me, Waldo,â said Bonaparte:
                        âmy condition would touch any heart. You see, the water was fatty, and that
                        has made all the sand stick to me; and my hair,â said Bonaparte, tenderly
                        touching the little fringe at the back of his head, âis all caked over like
                        a little plank; you wouldn't think it was hair at all,â said Bonaparte,
                        plaintively. âI had to creep all along the stone walls for fear she'd see
                        me, and with nothing on my head but a red handkerchief, tied under my chin,
                        Waldo; and to hide in a âslootâ the whole day, with not a mouthful of food,
                        Waldo. And she gave me such a blow, just here,â said Bonaparte.</p>
                    <p>He had cleared the plate of the last morsel, when Waldo rose and walked to
                        the door.</p>
                    <pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7167-236"/>
                    <p>âOh, Waldo, my dear boy, you are not going to call her?â said Bonaparte,
                        rising anxiously.</p>
                    <p>âI am going to sleep in the waggon,â said the boy, opening the door.</p>
                    <p>âOh, we can both sleep in this bed: there's plenty of room. Do stay, my boy,
                        please.â</p>
                    <p>But Waldo stepped out.</p>
                    <p>âIt was such a little whip, Waldo,â said Bonaparte, following him
                        deprecatingly. âI didn't think it would hurt you so much. It was such a
                            <emph>little</emph> whip. I'm <emph>sure</emph> you didn't take the
                        peaches. You aren't going to call her, Waldo, are you?â</p>
                    <p>But the boy walked off.</p>
                    <p>Bonaparte waited till his figure had passed round the front of the
                        waggon-house, and then slipped out. He hid himself round the corner, but
                        kept peeping out to see who was coming. He felt sure the boy was gone to
                        call Tant' Sannie. His teeth chattered with inward cold as he looked round
                        into the darkness and thought of the snakes that might bite him, and the<pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7167-237"/> dreadful things that might attack him,
                        and the dead that might arise out of their graves if he slept out in the
                        field all night. But more than an hour passed, and no footstep
                        approached.</p>
                    <p>Then Bonaparte made his way back to the cabin. He buttoned the door and put
                        the table against it and, giving the dog a kick to silence his whining when
                        the foot throbbed, he climbed into bed. He did not put out the light, for
                        fear of the ghost, but, worn out with the sorrows of the day, was soon
                        asleep himself.</p>
                    <p>About four o'clock Waldo, lying between the seats of the horse-waggon, was
                        awakened by a gentle touch on his head. Sitting up, he espied Bonaparte
                        looking through one of the windows with a lighted candle in his hand.</p>
                    <p>âI'm about to depart, my dear boy, before my enemies arise; and I could not
                        leave without coming to bid you farewell,â said Bonaparte.</p>
                    <p>Waldo looked at him.</p>
                    <p>âI shall always think of you with affection,â<pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7167-238"/> said Bonaparte. âAnd there's that old hat of yours, if you could let me
                        have it for a keepsakeââ</p>
                    <p>âTake it,â said Waldo.</p>
                    <p>âI thought you would say so, so I brought it with me,â said Bonaparte,
                        putting it on. âThe Lord bless you, my dear boy. You haven't a few
                        shillingsâjust a trifle you don't need,âhave you?â</p>
                    <p>âTake the two shillings that are in the broken vase.â</p>
                    <p>âMay the blessing of my God rest upon you, my dear child,â said Bonaparte;
                        âmay He guide and bless you. Give me your hand.â</p>
                    <p>Waldo folded his arms closely, and lay down.</p>
                    <p>âFarewell, adieu!â said Bonaparte. âMay the blessing of my God and my
                        father's God rest on you, now and evermore.â</p>
                    <p>With these words the head and nose withdrew themselves, and the light
                        vanished from the window.</p>
                    <pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7167-239"/>
                    <p>After a few moments the boy, lying in the waggon, heard stealthy footsteps as
                        they passed the waggon-house and made their way down the road. He listened
                        as they grew fainter and fainter, and at last died away altogether; and from
                        that night the footstep of Bonaparte Blenkins was heard no more at the old
                        farm.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">WALDO</hi> lay on his stomach on the sand. Since he prayed and
                        howled to his God in the fuel-house three years had passed.</p>
                    <p>They say that in the world to come time is not measured out by months and
                        years. Neither is it here. The soul's life has seasons of its own; periods
                        not found in any calendar, times that years and months will not scan, but
                        which are as deftly and sharply cut off from one another as the
                        smoothly-arranged years which the earth's motion yields us.</p>
                    <p>To stranger eyes these divisions are not evident; but each, looking back at
                        the little<pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7167-242"/> track his consciousness
                        illuminates, sees it cut into distinct portions, whose boundaries are the
                        termination of mental states.</p>
                    <p>As man differs from man, so differ these souls' years. The most material life
                        is not devoid of them; the story of the most spiritual is told in them. And
                        it may chance that some, looking back, see the past cut out after this
                        fashion:â</p>
                    <div type="section">
                        <head>I.</head>
                        <p>The year of infancy, where from the shadowy background of forgetfulness
                            start out pictures of startling clearness, disconnected, but brightly
                            coloured, and indelibly printed in the mind. Much that follows fades,
                            but the colours of those baby-pictures are permanent.</p>
                        <p>There rises, perhaps, a warm summer's evening; we are seated on the
                            door-step; we have yet the taste of the bread and milk in our mouth, and
                            the red sunset is reflected in our basin.</p>
                        <pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7167-243"/>
                        <p>Then there is a dark night, where, waking with a nameless fear, we run
                            from our own bed to another, creep close to some large figure, and are
                            comforted.</p>
                        <p>Then there is remembrance of the pride when, on some one's shoulder, with
                            our arms around their head, we ride to see the little pigs.</p>
                        <p>Remembrance of delight in the feel and smell of the first orange we ever
                            see; of sorrow which makes us put up our lip, and cry hard, when one
                            morning we run out to try and catch the dew-drops, and they melt and wet
                            our little fingers; of almighty and despairing sorrow when we are lost
                            behind the kraals, and cannot see the house anywhere.</p>
                        <p>And then one picture starts out more vividly than any.</p>
                        <p>There has been a thunder-storm; the ground, as far as the eye can reach,
                            is covered with white hail; the clouds are gone, and overhead a deep
                            blue sky is showing; far off a great<pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7167-244"/>
                            rainbow rests on the white earth. We, standing in a window to look, feel
                            the cool, unspeakably sweet wind blowing in on us, and a feeling of
                            longing comes over usâunutterable longing, we cannot tell for what. We
                            look at the white earth, and the rainbow, and the blue sky; and oh, we
                            want it, we wantâwe do not know what. We cry as though our heart was
                            broken. When one lifts our little body from the window we cannot tell
                            what ails us. We run away to play.</p>
                        <p>So looks the first year.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="section">
                        <head>II.</head>
                        <p>Now the pictures become continuous and connected. Material things still
                            rule, but the spiritual and intellectual take their places.</p>
                        <p>In the dark night when we are afraid we pray and shut our eyes. We press
                            our fingers very hard upon the lids, and see dark spots<pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7167-245"/> moving round and round, and we know they are
                            heads and wings of angels sent to take care of us, seen dimly in the
                            dark as they move round our bed. It is very consoling.</p>
                        <p>In the day we learn our letters, and are troubled because we cannot see
                            why k-n-o-w should be know, and p-s-a-l-m psalm. They tell us it is so
                            because it <emph>is</emph> so. We are not satisfied; we hate to learn;
                            we like better to build little stone houses. We can build them as we
                            please, and know the reason for them.</p>
                        <p>Other joys too we have incomparably greater.</p>
                        <p>We are run through with a shudder of delight when in the red sand we come
                            on one of those white wax-flowers that lie between their two green
                            leaves flat on the sand. We hardly dare pick them, but we feel compelled
                            to do so; and we smell and smell till the delight becomes almost pain.
                            Afterwards we pull the green leaves softly into pieces to see the silk
                            threads run across.</p>
                        <p>Beyond the âkopjeâ grow some dull-green,<pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7167-246"/> hairy-leaved bushes. We are so small they meet over our head; and we
                            sit among them, and talk to them, and kiss them, and they love us
                            back.</p>
                        <p>One day we sit there and look up at the blue sky, and down at our fat
                            little knees; and suddenly it strikes us, Who are we? This
                                <emph>I</emph>, what is it? We try to look in upon ourselves, and
                            ourself beats back upon ourself. Then we get up in great fear and run
                            home as hard as we can. We can't tell any one what frightened us. We
                            never quite lose that feeling of <hi>self</hi> again.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="section">
                        <head>III.</head>
                        <p>And then a new time rises. We are seven years old. We can read nowâread
                            the Bible. Best of all we like the story of Elijah in his cave at Horeb,
                            and the still small voice.</p>
                        <p>One day, a notable one, we read on the<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7167-247"/>
                            âkopje,â and discover the fifth chapter of Matthew, and read it all
                            through. Then we tuck the Bible under our arm and rush home. They didn't
                            know it was wicked to take your things again if some one took them,
                            wicked to go to law, wicked toâ! We are quite breathless when we get to
                            the house; we tell them we have discovered a chapter they never heard
                            of; we tell them what it says. The old wise people tell us they knew all
                            about it. Our discovery is a mare's-nest to them; but to us it is very
                            real. The ten commandments and the old âThou shaltâ we have heard about
                            long enough and don't care about it; but this new law sets us on fire.
                            We will deny ourself. Our little waggon that we have made, we give to
                            the little Kaffirs. We keep quiet when they throw sand at us (feeling,
                            oh, so happy). We conscientiously put the cracked tea-cup for ourselves
                            at breakfast, and take the burnt roaster-cake. We save our money, and
                            buy threepence of tobacco<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7167-248"/> for the
                            Hottentot maid who calls us names. We are exotically virtuous. At night
                            we are profoundly religious; even the ticking watch says, âEternity,
                            eternity! hell, hell, hell!â and the silence talks of God.</p>
                        <p>Occasionally, also, unpleasantly shrewd questions begin to be asked by
                            something, we know not what, in ourselves. We get to know him better
                            afterward. We carry the questions to the grown-up people. They give us
                            answers; we are more or less satisfied for the time. The grown-up people
                            are very wise, and they say it was kind of God to make hell, and very
                            loving of Him to send men there; and besides, He couldn't help Himself,
                            and they are very wise, we think, so we believe them.</p>

                        <p>Then a new time comes of which the leading feature is, that the shrewd
                            questions are asked<pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7167-249"/> louder. We carry
                            them to the grown-up people; they answer us, and we are <emph>not</emph>
                            satisfied.</p>
                        <p>And now between us and the dear old world of the senses the spirit-world
                            begins to peep in, and wholly clouds it over. What are the flowers to
                            us? They are fuel waiting for the great burning. We look at the walls of
                            the farmhouse and the matter-of-fact sheep âkraals,â with the merry
                            sunshine playing over all, and do not see it. But we see a great white
                            throne, and Him that sits on it. Around Him stand a great multitude that
                            no man can number, harpers harping with their harps, a thousand times
                            ten thousand, and thousands of thousands. How white are their robes,
                            washed in the blood of the Lamb! And the music rises higher, and rends
                            the vault of heaven with its unutterable sweetness. And we, as we
                            listen, ever and anon, as it sinks on the sweetest, lowest note, hear a
                            groan of the damned from below. We shudder in the sunlight.</p>
                        <pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7167-250"/>
                        <p>âThe torment,â says Jeremy Taylor, whose sermons our father reads aloud
                            in the evening, âcomprises as many torments as the body of man has
                            joints, sinews, arteries, &amp;c., being caused by that penetrating
                            and real fire, of which this temporal fire is but a painted fire. What
                            comparison will there be between burning for a hundred years' space and
                            to be burning without intermission as long as God is God?â</p>
                        <p>We remember the sermon there in the sunlight. One comes and asks why we
                            sit there nodding so moodily. Ah, they do not see what we see. <q>
                                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                                    <l>âA moment's time, a narrow space,</l>
                                    <l>Divides me from that heavenly place,</l>

                            </q> So says Wesley's hymn, which we sing evening by evening. What
                            matter sunshine and walls, men and books?</p>
                        <p>âThe things which are seen are temporal, but<pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7167-251"/> the things which are not seen are eternal.â
                            They are real.</p>
                        <p>The Bible we bear always in our breast; its pages are our food; we learn
                            to repeat it; we weep much, for in sunshine and in shade, in the early
                            morning or the late evening, in the field or in the house, the Devil
                            walks with us. He comes to a real person, copper-coloured face, head a
                            little on one side, forehead knit, asking questions. Believe me, it
                            would be better to be followed by three deadly diseases than by him. He
                            is never silenced, never satisfiedâwithout mercy. Though the drops of
                            blood stand out on your heart he will put his question. Softly he comes
                            up (we are only a wee bit child, mark you); âIs it good of God to make
                            hell? Was it kind of Him to let no one be forgiven unless Jesus Christ
                            died?â</p>
                        <p>Then he goes off, and leaves us writhing. Presently he comes back.</p>
                        <p>âDo you love Him?ââwaits a little. âDo<pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7167-252"/>
                            you love Him? You will be lost if you don't.â</p>
                        <p>We say we try to.</p>
                        <p>âBut do you?â Then he goes off.</p>
                        <p>It is nothing to him if we go quite mad with fear at our own wickedness.
                            He asks on, the questioning Devil; he cares nothing what he says. We
                            long to tell some one, that they may share our pain. We do not yet know
                            that the cup of affliction is made with such a narrow mouth that only
                            one lip can drink at a time, and that each man's cup is made to match
                            his lip.</p>
                        <p>One day we try to tell some one. Then a grave head is shaken solemnly at
                            us. We are wicked, very wicked, they say we ought not to have such
                            thoughts. God is good, very good. We are wicked, very wicked. That is
                            the comfort we get. Wicked! Oh, Lord! do we not know it? Is it not the
                            sense of our own exceeding wickedness that is drying up our<pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7167-253"/> young heart, filling it with sand, making all
                            life a dust-bin for us?</p>
                        <p>Wicked? We know it! Too vile to live, too vile to die, too vile to creep
                            over this, God's earth, and move among His believing men. Hell is the
                            one place for him who hates his master, and there we do not want to
                            go.</p>
                        <p>And once again we try to seek for comfort. This time great eyes look at
                            us wondering, and lovely little lips say,â</p>
                        <p>âIf it makes you so unhappy to think of these things, why do you not
                            think of <emph>something else, and forget?</emph>â</p>
                        <p>Forget? We turn away and shrink into ourself. Forget? and think of other
                            things? Oh, God! do they not understand that the material world is but a
                            film, through every pore of which God's awful spirit world is shining
                            through on us, poor miserable little wretches that we are? We keep as
                            far from others as we can.</p>
                        <p>One night, we kneel in the window; every one<pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7167-254"/> else sleeps, but we kneel reading by the
                            moonlight. It is only a chapter of the prophets, telling how the chosen
                            people of God shall be carried on the Gentiles' shoulders. Surely the
                            Devil might leave us alone; there is not much to handle for him there.
                            But presently we hear him.</p>
                        <p>âIs it right there should be a chosen people? If you should be chosen
                            out, would it be right, fair?â</p>
                        <p>How can we answer him? We were feeling so good till he came. We put our
                            head down on the Bible and blister it with tears. Then we fold our hands
                            over our head and pray, till our teeth grind together. Oh, that from
                            that spirit-world, so real and yet so silent, that surrounds us, one
                            word would come to guide us! We are left alone with this devil; the
                            angels do not come. Suddenly we seize the Bible, turning it round and
                            round, and say hurriedly,â</p>
                        <p>âIt will be God's voice speaking to us; His voice as though we heard
                            it.â</p>
                        <pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7167-255"/>
                        <p>We yearn, oh, so hugrily, for a token from the inexorably silent One.</p>
                        <p>We turn the book, put our finger down on a page, and bend to read by the
                            moonlight. It is God's answer. We tremble.</p>
                        <p>âThen fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas,
                            and took Titus with me also.â</p>
                        <p>For an instant our imagination seizes it; we are twisting, twirling,
                            trying to make an allegory. The fourteen years are fourteen months; we
                            are Paul and the devil is Barnabas, Titus isâ Then a sudden loathing
                            comes to us: we are liars and hypocrites, we are trying to deceive
                            ourselves. What is Paul to usâand Jerusalem? Who are Barnabas and Titus?
                            We know not the men. This is no answer. Before we know we seize the
                            book, swing it round our head, and fling it with all our might to the
                            farthest end of the room. We put down our head again and weep. Youth and
                            ignorance yearning for light:<pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7167-256"/> is there
                            anything else that can weep so? It is as though the tears were drops of
                            blood congealed beneath the eyelids; nothing else is like those tears.
                            After a long time, when we are weak with crying, and lie silent, by
                            chance we knock against the wood that stops the broken pane. It falls.
                            Upon our hot stiff face a sweet breath of wind blows. We raise our head,
                            and with our swollen eyes look out at the beautiful still world, and the
                            sweet night wind blows in upon us, holy and gentle, like a loving breath
                            from the lips of God. Over us a deep peace comes, a calm, still joy; the
                            tears now flow readily and softly. Oh, the unutterable gladness! At
                            last, at last we have found it! â<hi>The peace with God.</hi>â â<hi>The
                                sense of sins forgiven.</hi>â All doubt vanished, God's voice in the
                            soul, the Holy Spirit filling us! We feel Him! we feel Him! Oh, Jesus
                            Christ! through you, through you, this joy! We press our hands upon our
                            breast and look upward with adoring gladness. Soft waves of bliss
                                break<pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7167-257"/> through us. â<hi>The peace
                                with God.</hi>â â<hi>The sense of sins forgiven.</hi>â Methodists
                            and Revivalists say the words, and the mocking world shoots out its lip,
                            and walks by smilingââHypocrite!â</p>
                        <p>There are more fools and fewer hypocrites than the wise world dreams of.
                            Hypocrites are rare as icebergs in the tropics; fools common as
                            buttercups beside a water-furrow: whether you go this way or that you
                            tread on them; you dare not look at your own reflection in the water but
                            you see one. There is no cant phrase, rotten with age, but it was the
                            dress of a living body; none but at heart it signifies a real bodily or
                            mental condition.</p>
                        <p>After hours and nights of frenzied fear of the supernatural, desire to
                            appease the power above, a fierce quivering excitement in every inch of
                            nerve and blood-vessel, there comes a time when nature cannot <choice>
                                <sic/>
                                <corr>endure</corr>
                            </choice> longer, and the spring long bent recoils. We sink down
                            emasculated. Up creeps the deadly delicious calm.</p>
                        <pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7167-258"/>
                        <p>âI have blotted out as a cloud thy sins, and as a thick cloud thy
                            trespasses, and will remember them no more for ever.â We weep with soft
                            transporting joy.</p>
                        <p>A few experience this; many imagine they experience it, one here and
                            there lies about it. In the main, âThe peace with God; a sense of sins
                            forgiven,â stands for a certain mental and physical reaction. Its
                            reality those know who have felt it.</p>
                        <p>And we, on that moonlight night, put down our head on the window, âOh,
                            God! we are happy, happy; thy child forever. Oh, thank you, God!â and we
                            drop asleep.</p>
                        <p>Next morning the Bible we kiss. We are God's forever. We go out to work,
                            and it goes happily all day, happily all night; but hardly so happily,
                            not happily at all, the next day; and the next night the devil asks us,
                            âWhere is your Holy Spirit?â</p>
                        <p>We cannot tell.</p>
                        <pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7167-259"/>
                        <p>So month by month, summer and winter, the old life goes onâreading,
                            praying, weeping, praying. They tell us we become utterly stupid. We
                            know it. Even the multiplication table we learnt with so much care we
                            forgot. The physical world recedes further and further from us. Truly we
                            love not the world, neither the things that are in it. Across the bounds
                            of sleep our grief follows us. When we wake in the night we are sitting
                            up in bed weeping bitterly, or find ourself outside in the moonlight,
                            dressed, and walking up and down, and wringing our hands, and we cannot
                            tell how we came there. So pass two years, as men reckon them.</p>

                        <p>Then a new time.</p>
                        <p>Before us there were three courses possibleâto go mad, to die, to
                            sleep.</p>
                        <pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7167-260"/>
                        <p>We take the latter course; nature takes it for us.</p>
                        <p>All things take rest in sleep; the beast, bird, the very flowers close
                            their eyes, and the streams are frozen in winter. All things take rest
                            in sleep; then why not the human reason also? So we drop asleep, and in
                            that sleep a beautiful dream rises for us. Though you hear all the
                            dreams of men, you will hardly find a prettier one than ours. It ran
                            so:â</p>
                        <p>In the centre of all things is a Mighty Heart, which, having begotten all
                            things, loves them; and, having born them into life, beats with great
                            throbs of love towards them. No death for His dear insects, no hell for
                            His loved men, no burning up for His dear worldâHis own, own world! In
                            the end all will be well. Do not ask us how we make our dream tally with
                            facts; the glory of a dream is thisâthat it despises facts, and makes
                            its own. Our dream saves us from going mad; that is enough.</p>
                        <pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7167-261"/>
                        <p>Its peculiar point of sweetness lay here. When the Mighty Heart's
                            yearning of love became too great for other expression, it became the
                            sweet Rose of heaven, the beloved ManâGod.</p>
                        <p>Jesus! you Jesus of our dream! how we loved you; no Bible tells of you as
                            we know you. Your sweet hands held ours fast; your sweet voice said
                            always, âI am here, my loved one, not far off; put your arms about Me.â
                            We found Him in everything in those days. When the little weary lamb we
                            drive home drags its feet, we seize on it, and carry it with its head
                            against our face. His little lamb! We feel we have got Him.</p>
                        <p>When the drunken Kaffir lies by the road in the sun we draw his blanket
                            over his head, and put green branches of milk-bush on it. His Kaffir;
                            why should the sun hurt him?</p>
                        <p>In the evening, when the clouds lift themselves like gates, and the red
                            lights shine through them, we cry; for in such glory He will come,<pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7167-262"/> and the hands that ache to touch Him
                            will hold him, and we shall see the beautiful hair and eyes of our
                            God.</p>
                        <p>âLift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting
                            doors, and our King of glory shall come in!â The purple flowers, the
                            little purple flowers are His eyes, looking at us. We kiss them, and
                            kneel alone on the flat, rejoicing over them.</p>
                        <p>And the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for Him, and the
                            desert shall rejoice and blossom as a rose. If ever in our tearful,
                            joyful ecstasy the poor, sleepy, half-dead devil should raise his head,
                            we laugh at him. It is not his hour now.</p>
                        <p>âIf there should be a hell, after all!â he mutters. âIf your God should
                            be cruel! If there should be no God! If you should find out it is all
                            imagination! Ifââ</p>
                        <p>We laugh at him. When a man sits in the warm sunshine, do you ask him for
                            proof of it?<pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7167-263"/> He feelsâthat is all. And
                            we feelâthat is all. We want no proof of our God. We feel, we feel!</p>
                        <p>Do we believe in our God because the Bible tells us of Him? We believe in
                            the Bible because He tells us of it. We feel Him, we feel Him, we
                            feelâthat is all! And the poor, half-swamped Devil muttersâ</p>
                        <p>âBut if the day should come when you do not feel?â</p>
                        <p>And we laugh and cry him down.</p>
                        <p>âIt will never comeânever, never,â and the poor Devil slinks to sleep
                            again, with his tail between his legs. Fierce assertion many times
                            repeated is hard to stand against. It is most wisely met by silence.
                            Time separates the truth from the lie. So we dream on.</p>
                        <p>One day we go to town and to church. The townspeople rustle in in their
                            silks, and the men in their sleek cloth, and settle themselves in their
                            pews, and the light shines in through the windows on the artificial
                            flowers in the<pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7167-264"/> women's bonnets. We
                            have the same miserable feeling that we have in a shop where all the
                            clerks are very smart. We wish our Father hadn't brought us to town, and
                            we were out on the karroo. Then the man in the pulpit begins to preach.
                            His text is âHe that believeth not shall be damned.â</p>
                        <p>The day before an atheist has died in the street, struck by
                            lightning.</p>
                        <p>The man in the pulpit mentions no name; but he talks of âThe hand of God
                            made visible among us.â He tells us how, when the white stroke fell,
                            quivering and naked, the soul fled, robbed of his earthly filament, and
                            lay at the footstool of God; how over its head has been poured out the
                            wrath of the Mighty One, whose existence it has denied; and, quivering
                            and terrified, it has fled to the everlasting night.</p>
                        <p>We, as we listen, half start up; every drop of blood in our body has
                            rushed to our head. He lies! he lies! he lies! That man in the<pb n="263" xml:id="VAB7167-265"/> pulpit lies! Will no one stop him?
                            Have none of them heardâdo none of them know, that when the poor, dark
                            soul shut its eyes on earth it opened them in the still light of heaven?
                            that there is no wrath where God is? that if one could once creep to the
                            footstool of God, there is everlasting peace there? While the atheist
                            lay wondering and afraid, God bent down and said, âMy child,
                                <emph>here</emph> I amâI, whom you have not known; I, whom you have
                            not believed in; I am here. I sent My messenger, the white
                            sheet-lightning, to call you home. I am here.â</p>
                        <p>Then the poor soul turned to the lightâits weakness and pain were gone
                            for ever.</p>
                        <p>Have they not known, have they not heard, who it is rules?</p>
                        <p>âFor a little moment have I hidden My face from thee; but with
                            everlasting kindness will I have mercy upon thee, saith the Lord thy
                            Redeemer.â</p>
                        <p>We mutter on to ourselves, till some one pulls<pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7167-266"/> us violently by the arm to remind us we are
                            in church. We see nothing but our own ideas.</p>
                        <p>Presently every one turns to pray. There are six hundred souls lifting
                            themselves to the Everlasting Light.</p>
                        <p>Behind us sit two pretty ladies; one hands her scent-bottle softly to the
                            other, and a mother pulls down her little girl's frock. One lady drops
                            her handkerchief; a gentleman picks it up; she blushes. The women in the
                            choir turn softly the leaves of their tune-books, to be ready when the
                            praying is done. It is as though they thought more of the singing than
                            the Everlasting Father. Oh, would it not be more worship of Him to sit
                            alone in the karoo and kiss one little field flower that He had made? Is
                            it not mockery? Then the thought comes, â<hi>What doest thou here,
                                Elijah?</hi>â We who judge, what are we better than they?ârather
                            worse. Is it any excuse to say we are but a child and must come? Does
                            God allow any soul to step in<pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7167-267"/> between
                            the spirit he made and himself? What do we there in that place, where
                            all the words to us seem lies of the All Father, and the worship a
                            seeming. Filled with horror, we turn and flee out of the place. On the
                            pavement we smite our foot, and swear in our child's soul, never again
                            to enter those places where men come to worship. We are questioned
                            afterwards. Why was it we went out of church?</p>
                        <p>How can we explain?âwe stand silent. Then we are pressed further, and we
                            try to tell. Upon that a head is shaken solemnly at us. <emph>No
                                one</emph> can think it wrong to go to the house of the Lord; it is
                            the idle excuse of a wicked boy. When will we think seriously of our
                            souls, and love going to church? We are wicked, very wicked. And weâwe
                            slink away and go alone to cry. Will it be always so? If we hate and
                            doubt, or believe and love, to our dearest, are we to seem always
                            wicked, wicked, wicked? Nothing else!</p>
                        <pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7167-268"/>
                        <p>We do not yet know that in the soul's search for truth the bitterness
                            lies here; the striving cannot always hide itself among the thoughts;
                            sooner or later it will clothe itself in outward action; then it steps
                            in and divides between us and our nearest. All things on earth have
                            their price; and for truth we pay the dearest. We barter it for love and
                            sympathy. The road to honour is paved with thorns; but on the path to
                            truth, at every step you set your foot down on your own heart.</p>

                        <head>VI.</head>
                        <p>Then at last a new timeâthe time of waking: short, sharp, and not
                            pleasant.</p>
                        <p>Sleep and dreams exist on this conditionâthat no one wake the
                            dreamer.</p>
                        <p>And life takes us up between her finger and thumb, shakes us furiously,
                            till our poor<pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7167-269"/> nodding head is
                            well-nigh rolled from our shoulders, and she sets us down a little hard
                            on the bare earth, bruised and sore, but preternaturally wide awake.</p>
                        <p>We have said in our days of dreaming, âInjustice and wrong are a seeming;
                            pain is a shadow. Our God, He is real, He who made all things, and He
                            only is Love.â</p>
                        <p>Now life takes us by the neck and shows us a few other things,ânew-made
                            graves with the red sand flying about them; eyes that we love with the
                            worms eating them; evil men walking sleek and fat,âand she says, âWhat
                            do you think of these?â We dare not say âNothing.â We feel them! we feel
                            them! They are very real. But we try to lay our hands about and feel
                            that other thing we felt before. In the dark night in the fuel-room we
                            cry to our Beautiful dream-god: âOh, let us come near you, and lay our
                            head against your feet. Now in our hour of need be near<pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7167-270"/> us.â But He is not there; He is gone away.
                            The old questioning Devil is there; but He is not there; He is gone
                            away.</p>
                        <p>We must have been awakened sooner or later. The imagination cannot always
                            triumph over reality, the desires over truth. We must have been
                            awakened. If it was done a little sharply, what matter? it was done
                            thoroughly.</p>

                        <head>VII.</head>
                        <p>And a new life begins for usâa new time: the old looks indeed like a long
                            hot delirium, peopled with phantasies.</p>
                        <p>Now we have no God. We have had two: the old God that our fathers handed
                            down to us, that we hated, and never liked: the new one that we made for
                            ourselves, that we loved; but one day he flitted away with the feelings
                            that gave him birth, and we saw what he was made<pb n="269" xml:id="VAB7167-271"/> ofâthe shadow of our highest ideal, crowned
                            and throned. Now we have no God; we sit down without any.</p>
                        <p>âThe fool hath said in his heart, âThere is no God.ââ It may be so. Most
                            things said or written have been the work of fools.</p>
                        <p><emph>This</emph> thing is certainâ<emph>he</emph> is a fool who says,
                            âNo man hath said in his heart, There is no God.â</p>
                        <p>It has been said many thousand times in hearts with profound earnestess
                            and bitter faith.</p>
                        <p>We do not cry and weep; we sit down with great cold eyes and look at the
                            world. We are not miserable. Why should we be? We eat and drink, and
                            sleep all night; but the dead are not colder.</p>
                        <p>And we say it slowly, but without sighing, âYes, we see it now: there is
                            no God.â</p>
                        <p>And, we add, growing a little colder yet, âThere is no justice. The ox
                            dies in the yoke, beneath its master's whip; it turns its anguish-<pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7167-272"/> filled eyes on the sunlight, but
                            there is no sign of recompense to be made it. The black man is shot like
                            a dog, and it goes well with the shooter. The innocent are accused and
                            the accuser triumphs. If you will take the trouble to scratch the
                            surface anywhere, you will see under the skin a sentient being writhing
                            in impotent anguish.â</p>
                        <p>And, we say further, and our heart is as the heart of the dead for
                            coldness, âThere is no orderer and no order: all things are driven about
                            by a blind chance.â</p>
                        <p>What a soul drinks in with its mother's milk will not leave it in a day.
                            From our earliest hour we have been taught that the thought of the
                            heart, the shaping of the rain-cloud, the amount of wool that grows on a
                            sheep's back, the length of a drought, and the growing of the corn,
                            depend on nothing that moves immutable, deep at the heart of all things;
                            but on the changeable will of a changeable being, whom our prayers
                                can<pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7167-273"/> alter. To us, from the
                            beginning, nature has been but a poor plastic thing, to be toyed with
                            this way or that, as man happens to please his deity or not; to go to
                            church or not; to say his prayers right or not; to travel on a Sunday or
                            not. Was it possible for us in an instant to see Nature as she isâthe
                            flowing vestment of an unchanging reality? When the soul breaks free
                            from the arms of a superstition, bits of the claws and talons break
                            themselves off in him. It is not the work of a day to squeeze them
                            out.</p>
                        <p>And so, for us, the human-like driver and guider being gone, all
                            existence, as we look out at it with our chilled, wondering eyes, is an
                            aimless rise and swell of shifting waters. In all that weltering chaos
                            we can see no spot so large as a man's hand on which we may plant our
                            foot.</p>
                        <p>Whether a man believes in a human-like God or no is a small thing. It is
                            a great and terrible when he looks into the mental and physical world
                            and sees no relation between cause<pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7167-274"/> and
                            effect, no order, but a blind chance sporting. It were almost a mercy to
                            cut his throat, if indeed he does not do it for himself.</p>
                        <p>We, however, do not cut our throats. To do so would imply some desire and
                            feeling, and we have no desire and no feeling; we are only cold. We do
                            not wish to live, and we do not wish to die. One day a snake curls
                            itself round the waist of a Kaffir woman. We take it in our hand, swing
                            it round and round, and fling it on the groundâdead. Every one looks at
                            us with eyes of admiration. We almost laugh. Is it bravery to risk that
                            for which we care nothing?</p>
                        <p>In truth, nothing matters. This dirty little world full of confusion, and
                            the bit of blue stretched overhead for a sky, is worthless.</p>
                        <p>Existence, if it is not a dream, is a great pot, and the Fate who stirs
                            it round cares nothing what rises to the top and what goes down, and
                            laughs when the bubbles burst. And we do not care. Let it boil about.
                            Why should we<pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7167-275"/> trouble ourselves?
                            Nevertheless the physical sensations are real. Hunger hurts, and thirst;
                            therefore we eat and drink. Inaction pains us; therefore we work like
                            galley-slaves. No one demands it, but we set ourselves to build a great
                            dam in red sand beyond the graves. In the grey dawn before the sheep are
                            let out we are working at it. All day, while the young ostriches we tend
                            feed about us, we work on through the fiercest heat. The people wonder
                            what new spirit has seized us now. They do not know we are working for
                            our life. We bear the greatest stones, and feel a satisfaction when we
                            stagger under them, and are hurt by a pang that shoots through our
                            chest. While we eat our dinner we carry on baskets full of earth, as
                            though the devil drove us. The Kaffir servants have a story that at
                            night a witch and two white oxen come to help us. No wall, they say,
                            could grow so quickly under one man's hands.</p>
                        <p>At night, alone in our cabin, we sit no more brooding over the fire. What
                            should we think<pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7167-276"/> of now? It is all
                            emptiness. So we take the old arithmetic; and the multiplication table,
                            which with so much pains we learnt long ago and forgot directly, we
                            learn now in a few hours, and never forget again. We take a strange
                            satisfaction in working arithmetical problems. We pause in our building
                            to cover the stones with figures and calculations. We save money for a
                            Latin Grammar and an Algebra, and carry them about in our pockets,
                            poring over them as over our Bible of old. We have thought we were
                            utterly stupid, incapable of remembering anything, of learning anything.
                            Now we find that all is easy. Has a new soul crept into this old body,
                            that even our intellectual faculties are changed? We marvel; not
                            perceiving that what a man expends in prayer and ecstasy he cannot have
                            over for acquiring knowledge. You never shed a tear, or create a
                            beautiful image, or quiver with emotion, but you pay for it at the other
                            end of your nature. You have just<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7167-277"/> so
                            much force: when the one channel runs over the other runs dry.</p>
                        <p>And we turn to Nature. All these years we have lived beside her, and we
                            have never seen her; and now we open our eyes and look at her.</p>
                        <p>The rocks have been to us a blur of brown: we bend over them, and the
                            disorganised masses dissolve into a many-coloured, many-shaped,
                            carefully-arranged form of existence. Here masses of rainbow-tinted
                            crystals, half- fused together; there bands of smooth grey and red
                            methodically overlying each other. This rock here is covered with a
                            delicate silver tracery, in some mineral, resembling leaves and
                            branches; there on the flat stone, on which we so often have sat to weep
                            and pray, we look down, and see it covered with the fossil footprints of
                            great birds, and the beautiful skeleton of a fish. We have often tried
                            to picture in our mind what the fossiled remains of creatures must be
                            like, and all the while we sat on them.</p>
                        <pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7167-278"/>
                        <p>The flat plain has been to us a reach of monotonous red. We look at it,
                            and every handful of sand starts into life. That wonderful black people,
                            the ants, we learn to know; see them make war and peace, play and work,
                            and build their huge palaces. That smaller people we make acquaintance
                            with also who live in the flowers. The bitto flower has been for us a
                            mere blur of yellow; we find its heart composed of a hundred perfect
                            flowers, the homes of the tiny black people with red stripes, who move
                            in and out in that little yellow city. Every bluebell has its
                            inhabitant. Every day the karroo shows us a new wonder sleeping in its
                            teeming breast. On our way back to work we pause and stand to see the
                            ground spider make its trap, bury itself in the sand, and then wait for
                            the falling in of its enemy. Farther on walks a horned beetle, and near
                            him starts open the door of a spider, who peeps out carefully, and
                            quickly pulls it down again. On a karroo-bush a green fly is laying her
                            silver eggs. We<pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7167-279"/> carry them home, and
                            see the shells pierced, the spotted grub come out, turn to a green fly,
                            and go away. We are not satisfied with what Nature shows us, and we see
                            something for ourselves. Under the white hen we put a dozen eggs, and
                            break one daily, to see the white spot wax into the chicken. We are not
                            excited or enthusiastic about it; but a man must think of something if
                            he is to live at all. So we plant seeds in rows on our dam-wall, and
                            pull one up daily to see how it goes with them. Allardeen buried her
                            wonderful stone, and a golden palace sprung up at her feet. We do far
                            more. We put a brown seed in the earth, and a living thing starts out
                            before our eyesâstarts upwardâwhy, no more than Allardeen can we
                            sayâstarts upward, and does not desist till it is higher than our heads,
                            sparkling with dew in the early morning, glittering with yellow
                            blossoms, shaking brown seeds with little embryo souls on to the ground.
                            We look at it solemnly, from the time it is two small<pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7167-280"/> leaves peeping above the ground and a soft
                            white root, till we have to raise our faces to look at it; but we find
                            no reason for that upward starting.</p>
                        <p>We look into dead ducks and lambs. In the evening we carry them home,
                            spread newspapers on the floor, and lie working with them till midnight.
                            With a started feeling near akin to ecstasy we open the lump of flesh
                            called a heart, and find little doors and strings inside. We feel them,
                            and put the heart away; but every now and then return to look, and to
                            feel them again. Why we like them so we can hardly tell.</p>
                        <p>A gander drowns itself in our dam. We take it out, and open it on the
                            bank, and kneel, looking at it. Above are the organs divided by delicate
                            tissues; below are the intestines, artistically curved in a spiral form,
                            and each tier covered by a delicate network of blood-vessels, standing
                            out red against the faint blue background. Each branch of the
                            blood-vessels is<pb n="279" xml:id="VAB7167-281"/> comprised of a trunk,
                            bifurcating and rebifurcating into the most delicate, hair-like threads,
                            symmetrically arranged. We are struck with its singular beauty. And,
                            moreoverâand here we drop from our kneeling into a sitting postureâthis
                            also we remark: of that same exact shape and outline is our thorn-tree
                            seen against the sky in midwinter: of that shape also is delicate
                            metallic tracery between our rocks; in that exact path does our water
                            flow when without a furrow we lead it from the dam; so shaped are the
                            antlers of the horned beetle. How are these things related that such
                            deep union should exist between them all? Is it chance? Can it be? Or,
                            are they not all the fine branches of one trunk, whose sap flows through
                            us all? That would explain it. We nod over the gander's inside.</p>
                        <p>This thing we call existence; is it not a something which has its roots
                            far down below in the dark, and its branches stretching far out<pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7167-282"/> into the immensity above, which we
                            among the branches cannot see? Not a chance jumble; a living thing, a
                            whole, a <emph>One</emph>.</p>
                        <p>We nod over the gander; then start up suddenly, look into the blue sky,
                            throw the dead gander and the refuse into the dam, and go to work
                            again.</p>
                        <p>And so, it comes to pass in time, that the earth ceases for us to be a
                            weltering chaos. We walk in the great hall of the universe, our soul
                            looking up and round reverentially. Nothing is despicableâall is
                            meaning-full; nothing is smallâall is part of a whole, whose beginning
                            and end we know not. The life that throbs in us is a pulsation from
                            it.</p>
                        <p>And so, it comes to pass at last, that whereas the sky was at first a
                            small blue rag stretched out over us, and so low that our hands might
                            touch it, pressing down on us, it raises itself into an immeasurable
                            blue arch over our heads, and we begin to live again.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">WALDO</hi> lay on his stomach on the red sand. The small
                        ostriches he herded wandered about him, pecking at the food he had cut, or
                        at pebbles and dry sticks. On his right lay the graves; to his left the dam;
                        in his hand was a large wooden post covered with carvings, at which he
                        worked. Doss lay before him, basking in the winter sunshine, and now and
                        again casting an expectant glance at the corner of the nearest ostrich camp.
                        The scrubby thorn-trees under which they lay yielded no shade, but none was
                        needed in that glorious June weather, when in the hottest part of the
                        afternoon the sun was but pleasantly warm; and<pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7167-284"/> the boy carved on, not looking up, yet conscious
                        of the brown serene earth about him and the intensely blue sky above.</p>
                    <p>Presently, at the corner of the camp, Em appeared, bearing a covered saucer
                        in one hand and in the other a jug, with a cup in the top. She was grown
                        into a premature little old woman, ridiculously fat, and wearing long
                        dresses. The jug and saucer she put down on the ground before the dog and
                        his master and dropped down beside them herself, panting and out of
                        breath.</p>
                    <p>âOh, Waldo! as I came up the camps I met some one on horseback; and I do
                        believe it must be the new man.â</p>
                    <p>The new man was an Englishman to whom the Boer-woman had hired half the
                        farm.</p>
                    <p>âHum!â said Waldo.</p>
                    <p>âHe is quite young,â said Em, âand he has brown hair, and beard curling close
                        to his face, and such dark blue eyes. And, Waldo,<pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7167-285"/> I was so ashamed! I was just looking back to see,
                        you know, and he happened just to be looking back too, and we looked right
                        into each other's faces; and he got red, and I got so red.â</p>
                    <p>âYes,â said Waldo.</p>
                    <p>âI must go now. Perhaps he has brought us letters from the post from Lyndall.
                        And you know he will have to stay with us till his house is built. I must
                        get his room ready. Good-bye!â</p>
                    <p>She tripped off again, and Waldo carved on at his post. Doss lay with his
                        nose close to the covered saucer, and smelt that some one had made nice
                        little fat cakes that afternoon. Both were so intent on their occupation,
                        that not till a horse's hoofs beat beside them in the sand did they look up
                        to see a rider drawing in his steed.</p>
                    <p>He was certainly not the stranger whom Em had described. A dark, somewhat
                        French-looking little man of eight-and-twenty, rather stout,<pb n="284" xml:id="VAB7167-286"/> with heavy, cloudy eyes and pointed moustaches.
                        His horse was a fiery creature, well caparisoned; a highly-finished
                        saddle-bag hung from the saddle; the man's hands were gloved, and he
                        presented the appearanceâan appearance rare on that farmâof a well-dressed
                        gentleman.</p>
                    <p>In an uncommonly melodious voice he inquired whether he might be allowed to
                        remain there for an hour. Waldo directed him to the farm-house, but the
                        stranger declined. He would merely rest under the trees, and give his horse
                        water. He removed the saddle, and Waldo led the animal away to the dam. When
                        he returned, the stranger had settled himself under the trees, with his back
                        against the saddle. The boy offered him of the cakes. He declined, but took
                        a draught from the jug; and Waldo lay down not far off, and fell to work
                        again. It mattered nothing if cold eyes saw it. It was not his
                        sheep-shearing machine. With material loves, as with human, we go mad once,
                        love out, and<pb n="285" xml:id="VAB7167-287"/> have done. We never get up
                        the true enthusiasm a second time. This was but a thing he had made,
                        laboured over, loved and likedânothing more.</p>
                    <p>The stranger forced himself lower down in the saddle and yawned. It was a
                        drowsy afternoon, and he objected to travel in these out-of-the-world parts.
                        He liked better civilized life, where at every hour of the day a man may
                        look for his glass of wine, and his easy-chair, and paper; where at night he
                        may lock himself into his room with his books and a bottle of brandy, and
                        taste joys mental and physical. The world said of himâthe all-knowing,
                        omnipotent world, whom no locks can bar, who has the cat-like propensity of
                        seeing best in the darkâthe world said that better than the books he loved
                        the brandy, and better than books or brandy, that which it had been better
                        had he loved less. But for the world he cared nothing; he smiled blandly in
                        its teeth. All life is an aimless dream; if wine<pb n="286" xml:id="VAB7167-288"/> and philosophy and women keep the dream from
                        becoming a nightmare, so much the better. It is all they are fit for, all
                        they can be used for. There was another side to his life and thought, but of
                        that the world knew nothing and said nothing, as the way of the wise world
                        is.</p>
                    <p>The stranger looked from beneath his sleepy eyelids at the brown earth that
                        stretched away, beautiful in spite of itself in that June sunshine; looked
                        at the graves, the gables of the farm-house showing over the stone walls of
                        the camps, at the clownish fellow at his feet, and yawned. But he had drunk
                        of the hind's tea, and must say something.</p>
                    <p>âYour father's place, I presume?â he inquired sleepily.</p>
                    <p>âNo; I am only a servant.â</p>
                    <p>âDutch people?â</p>
                    <p>âYes.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd you like the life?â</p>
                    <p>The boy hesitated.</p>
                    <pb n="287" xml:id="VAB7167-289"/>
                    <p>âOn days like these.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd why on these?â</p>
                    <p>The boy waited.</p>
                    <p>âThey are very beautiful.â</p>
                    <p>The stranger looked at him. It seemed that as the fellow's dark eyes looked
                        across the brown earth they kindled with an intense satisfaction; then they
                        looked back at the carving.</p>
                    <p>What had that creature, so coarse-clad and clownish, to do with the subtle
                        joys of the weather? Himself, white-handed and delicate, <emph>he</emph>
                        might hear the music with shimmering sunshine and solitude play on the
                        finely-strung chords of nature; but that fellow! Was not the ear in that
                        great body too gross for such delicate mutterings?</p>
                    <p>Presently he said,</p>
                    <p>âMay I see what you work at?â</p>
                    <p>The fellow handed his wooden post. It was by no means lovely. The men and
                        birds were almost grotesque in their laboured resemblance<pb n="288" xml:id="VAB7167-290"/> to nature, and bore signs of patient thought. The
                        stranger turned the thing over on his knee.</p>
                    <p>âWhere did you learn this work?â</p>
                    <p>âI taught myself.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd these zigzag lines representââ</p>
                    <p>âA mountain.â</p>
                    <p>The stranger looked.</p>
                    <p>âIt has some meaning, has it not?â</p>
                    <p>The boy muttered confusedly,</p>
                    <p>âOnly things.â</p>
                    <p>The questioner looked down at himâthe huge, unwieldy figure, in size a man's,
                        in right of his child-like features and curling hair a child's; and it hurt
                        himâit attracted him and it hurt him. It was something between pity and
                        sympathy.</p>
                    <p>âHow long have you worked at this?â</p>
                    <p>âNine months.â</p>
                    <p>From his pocket the stranger drew his pocket-book, and took something from
                        it. He could<pb n="289" xml:id="VAB7167-291"/> fasten the post to his horse
                        in some way, and throw it away in the sand at safe distance.</p>
                    <p>âWill you take this for your carving?â</p>
                    <p>The boy glanced at the five-pound note and shook his head.</p>
                    <p>âNo; I cannot.â</p>
                    <p>âYou think it is worth more?â asked the stranger with a little sneer.</p>
                    <p>He pointed with his thumb to a grave.</p>
                    <p>âNo; it is for him.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd who is there?â asked the stranger.</p>
                    <p>âMy father.â</p>
                    <p>The man silently returned the note to his pocket-book, and gave the carving
                        to the boy; and, drawing his hat over his eyes, composed himself to sleep.
                        Not being able to do so, after a while he glanced over the fellow's shoulder
                        to watch him work. The boy carved letters into the back.</p>
                    <p>âIf,â said the stranger, with his melodious voice, rich with a sweetness that
                        never shewed<pb n="290" xml:id="VAB7167-292"/> itself in the clouded eyes,
                        âif for such a purpose, why write that upon it?â</p>
                    <p>The boy glanced round at him, but made no answer. He had almost forgotten his
                        presence.</p>
                    <p>âYou surely believe,â said the stranger, âthat some day, sooner or later,
                        these graves will open, and those Boer-uncles with their wives walk about
                        here in the red sand, with the very fleshly legs with which they went to
                        sleep? You believe it, do you not? Then why say, âHe sleeps forever?â You
                        believe he will stand up again?â</p>
                    <p>âDo you?â asked the boy, lifting for an instant his heavy eyes to the
                        stranger's face.</p>
                    <p>Half taken aback, the stranger laughed. It was as though a curious little
                        tadpole which he held under his glass should suddenly lift its tail and
                        begin to ask questions.</p>
                    <p>âI?âno.â He laughed his short thick laugh. âI am a man who believes nothing,
                            hopes<pb n="291" xml:id="VAB7167-293"/> nothing, fears nothing, feels
                        nothing, trusts nothing. I am beyond the pale of humanity; no criterion of
                        what you should be who live here among your birds and bushes.â</p>
                    <p>The next moment the stranger was surprised by a sudden movement on the part
                        of the fellow, which brought him close to the stranger's feet. Soon after he
                        raised his carving and laid it across the man's knee.</p>
                    <p>âYes, I will tell you,â he muttered; âI will tell you all about it.â</p>
                    <p>He put his finger on the grotesque little mannikin at the bottom (Ah! that
                        man who believed nothing, hoped nothing, felt nothing; <emph>how he loved
                            him!</emph>), and, with eager finger the fellow moved upward, explaining
                        over fantastic figures and mountains, to the crowning bird from whose wing
                        dropped a feather. At the end he spoke with broken breathâshort words, like
                        one who utters things of mighty import.</p>
                    <p>The stranger watched more the face than the<pb n="292" xml:id="VAB7167-294"/>
                        carving; and there was now and then a show of white teeth beneath the
                        moustaches as he listened.</p>
                    <p>âI think,â he said blandly, when the boy had done, âthat I partly understand
                        you. It is something after this fashion, is it not?â (He smiled.) âIn
                        certain valleys there was a hunter.â (He touched the grotesque little figure
                        at the bottom.) âDay by day he went to hunt for wild-fowl in the woods; and
                        it chanced that once he stood on the shores of a large lake. While he stood
                        waiting in the rushes for the coming of the birds, a great shadow fell on
                        him, and in the water he saw a reflection. He looked up to the sky; but the
                        thing was gone. Then a burning desire came over him to see once again that
                        reflection in the water, and all day he watched and waited; but night came
                        and it had not returned. Then he went home with his empty bag, moody and
                        silent. His comrades came questioning about<pb n="293" xml:id="VAB7167-295"/> him to know the reason, but he answered them nothing; he sat alone and
                        brooded. Then his friend came to him, and to him he spoke.</p>
                    <p>ââI have seen to-day,â he said, âthat which I never saw beforeâa vast white
                        bird, with silver wings outstretched, sailing in the everlasting blue. And
                        now it is as though a great fire burnt within my breast. It was but a sheen,
                        a shimmer, a reflection in the water; but now I desire nothing more on earth
                        than to hold her.â</p>
                    <p>His friend laughed.</p>
                    <p>âIt was but a beam playing on the water, or the shadow of your own head.
                        To-morrow you will forget her,â he said.</p>
                    <p>But to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow the hunter walked alone. He
                        sought in the forest and in the woods, by the lakes and among the rushes,
                        but he could not find her. He shot no more wild fowl; what were they to
                        him?</p>
                    <p>âWhat ails him?â said his comrades.</p>
                    <p>âHe is mad,â said one.</p>
                    <pb n="294" xml:id="VAB7167-296"/>
                    <p>âNo; but he is worse,â said another; âhe would see that which none of us have
                        seen, and make himself a wonder.â</p>
                    <p>âCome, let us forswear his company,â said all.</p>
                    <p>So the hunter walked alone.</p>
                    <p>One night, as he wandered in the shade, very heart-sore and weeping, an old
                        man stood before him, grander and taller than the sons of men.</p>
                    <p>âWho are you?â asked the hunter.</p>
                    <p>âI am Wisdom,â answered the old man; âbut some men call me Knowledge. All my
                        life I have grown in these valleys; but no man sees me till he has sorrowed
                        much. The eyes must be washed with tears that are to behold me; and,
                        according as a man has suffered, I speak.â</p>
                    <p>And the hunter criedâ</p>
                    <p>âOh, you who have lived here so long, tell me, what is that great wild bird I
                        have seen sailing in the blue? They would have me believe she is a dream;
                        the shadow of my own head.â</p>
                    <pb n="295" xml:id="VAB7167-297"/>
                    <p>The old man smiled.</p>
                    <p>âHer name is Truth. He who has once seen her never rests again. Till death he
                        desires her.â</p>
                    <p>And the hunter criedâ</p>
                    <p>âOh, tell me where I may find her.â</p>
                    <p>But the old man said,</p>
                    <p>âYou have not suffered enough,â and went.</p>
                    <p>Then the hunter took from his breast the shuttle of Imagination, and wound on
                        it the thread of his Wishes; and all night he sat and wove a net.</p>
                    <p>In the morning he spread the golden net upon the ground, and into it he threw
                        a few grains of credulity, which his father had left him, and which he kept
                        in his breast pocket. They were like white puff-balls, and when you trod on
                        them a brown dust flew out. Then he sat by to see what would happen. The
                        first that came into the net was a snow-white bird, with dove's<pb n="296" xml:id="VAB7167-298"/> eyes, and he sang a beautiful songââA human-God!
                        a human-God! a human-God!â it sang. The second that came was black and
                        mystical, with dark, lovely eyes, that looked into the depths of your soul,
                        and he sang only thisââImmortality!â</p>
                    <p>And the hunter took them both in his arms, for he saidâ</p>
                    <p>âThey are surely of the beautiful family of Truth.â</p>
                    <p>Then came another, green and gold, who sang in a shrill voice, like one
                        crying in the marketplace,ââReward after Death! Reward after Death!â</p>
                    <p>And he saidâ</p>
                    <p>âYou are not so fair; but you are fair too,â and he took it.</p>
                    <p>And others came, brightly coloured, singing pleasant songs, till all the
                        grains were finished. And the hunter gathered all his birds together, and
                        built a strong iron cage called a new creed, and put all his birds in
                        it.</p>
                    <pb n="297" xml:id="VAB7167-299"/>
                    <p>Then the people came about dancing and singing.</p>
                    <p>âOh, happy hunter!â they cried. âOh, wonderful man! Oh, delightful birds! Oh,
                        lovely songs!â</p>
                    <p>No one asked where the birds had come from, nor how they had been caught; but
                        they danced and sang before them. And the hunter too was glad, for he
                        saidâ</p>
                    <p>âSurely Truth is among them. In time she will moult her feathers, and I shall
                        see her snow-white form.â</p>
                    <p>But the time passed, and the people sang and danced; but the hunter's heart
                        grew heavy. He crept alone, as of old, to weep; the terrible desire had
                        awakened again in his breast. One day, as he sat alone weeping, it chanced
                        that Wisdom met him. He told the old man what he had done.</p>
                    <p>And Wisdom smiled sadly.</p>
                    <p>âMany men,â he said, âhave spread that net<pb n="298" xml:id="VAB7167-300"/>
                        for Truth; but they have never found her. On the grains of credulity she
                        will not feed; in the net of wishes her feet cannot be held; in the air of
                        these valleys she will not breathe. The birds you have caught are of the
                        brood of Lies. Lovely and beautiful, but still lies; Truth knows them
                        not.â</p>
                    <p>And the hunter cried out in bitternessâ</p>
                    <p>âAnd must I then sit still, to be devoured of this great burning?â</p>
                    <p>And the old man said,</p>
                    <p>âListen, and in that you have suffered much and wept much, I will tell you
                        what I know. He who sets out to search for Truth must leave these valleys of
                        superstition for ever, taking with him not one shred that has belonged to
                        them. Alone he must wander down into the Land of Absolute Negation and
                        Denial; he must abide there; he must resist temptation; when the light
                        breaks he must arise and follow it into the country of dry sunshine. The
                        mountains of<pb n="299" xml:id="VAB7167-301"/> stern reality will rise
                        before him; he must climb them: <emph>beyond</emph> them lies Truth.â</p>
                    <p>âAnd he will hold her fast! he will hold her in his hands!â the hunter
                        cried.</p>
                    <p>Wisdom shook his head.</p>
                    <p>âHe will never see her, never hold her. The time is not yet.â</p>
                    <p>âThen there is no hope?â cried the hunter.</p>
                    <p>âThere is this,â said Wisdom: âSome men have climbed on those mountains;
                        circle above circle of bare rock they have scaled; and, wandering there, in
                        those high regions, some have chanced to pick up on the ground, one white,
                        silver feather, dropped from the wing of Truth. And it shall come to pass,â
                        said the old man, raising himself prophetically and pointing with his finger
                        to the sky, âit shall come to pass, that when enough of those silver
                        feathers shall have been gathered by the hands of men, and shall have been
                        woven into a cord, and the cord into a net, that in <emph>that</emph><pb n="300" xml:id="VAB7167-302"/> net Truth may be captured. <emph>Nothing
                            but Truth can hold Truth.</emph>â</p>
                    <p>The hunter arose. âI will go,â he said.</p>
                    <p>But Wisdom detained him.</p>
                    <p>âMark you wellâwho leaves these valleys <emph>never</emph> returns to them.
                        Though he should weep tears of blood seven days and nights upon the
                        confines, he can never put his foot across them. Leftâthey are left forever.
                        Upon the road which you would travel there is no reward offered. Who goes,
                        goes freelyâfor the great love that is in him. The work is his reward.â</p>
                    <p>âI go,â said the hunter; âbut upon the mountains, tell me, which path shall I
                        take?â</p>
                    <p>âI am the child of The-Accumulated-Knowledge-of-Ages,â said the man; âI can
                        walk only where many men have trodden. On these mountains few feet have
                        passed; each man strikes out a path for himself. He goes at his own peril:
                        my voice he hears no more. I may follow after him, but cannot go before
                        him.â</p>
                    <pb n="301" xml:id="VAB7167-303"/>
                    <p>Then Knowledge vanished.</p>
                    <p>And the hunter turned. He went to his cage, and with his hands broke down the
                        bars, and the jagged iron tore his flesh. It is sometimes easier to build
                        than to break.</p>
                    <p>One by one he took his plumed birds and let them fly. But when he came to his
                        dark-plumed bird he held it, and looked into its beautiful eyes, and the
                        bird uttered its low, deep cryââImmortality!â</p>
                    <p>And he said quickly, âI cannot part with it. It is not heavy; it eats no
                        food. I will hide it in my breast; I will take it with me.â And he buried it
                        there and covered it over with his cloak.</p>
                    <p>But the thing he had hidden grew heavier, heavier, heavierâtill it lay on his
                        breast like lead. He could not move with it. Then again he took it out and
                        looked at it.</p>
                    <p>âOh, my beautiful! my heart's own!â he cried, âmay I not keep you?â</p>
                    <pb n="302" xml:id="VAB7167-304"/>
                    <p>He opened his hands sadly.</p>
                    <p>âGo!â he said. âIt may happen that in Truth's song one note is like yours;
                        but <emph>I</emph> shall never hear it.â</p>
                    <p>Sadly he opened his hand, and the bird flew from him forever.</p>
                    <p>Then from the shuttle of imagination he took the thread of his wishes, and
                        threw it on the ground; and the empty shuttle he put into his breast, for
                        the thread was made in those valleys, but the shuttle came from an unknown
                        country. He turned to go, but now the people came about him, howling.</p>
                    <p>âFool, hound, demented lunatic!â they cried. âHow dared you break your cage
                        and let the birds fly?â</p>
                    <p>The hunter spoke; but they would not hear him.</p>
                    <p>âTruth! who is she? Can you eat her? can you drink her? who has ever seen
                        her? Your birds were real: all could hear them sing!<pb n="303" xml:id="VAB7167-305"/> Oh, fool! vile reptile! atheist!â they cried,
                        âyou pollute the air.â</p>
                    <p>âCome, let us take up stones and stone him,â cried some.</p>
                    <p>âWhat affair is it of ours?â said others. âLet the idiot go,â and went away.
                        But the rest gathered up stones and mud and threw at him. At last, when he
                        was bruised and cut, the hunter crept away into the woods. And it was
                        evening about him.â</p>
                    <p>At every word the stranger spoke the fellow's eyes flashed back on himâyes,
                        and yes, and yes! The stranger smiled. It was almost worth the trouble of
                        exerting oneself, even on a lazy afternoon, to win those passionate flashes,
                        more thirsty and desiring than the love-glances of a woman.</p>
                    <p>âHe wandered on and on,â said the stranger, âand the shade grew deeper. He
                        was on the borders now of the land where it is always night. Then he stepped
                        into it, and there was no light there. With his hands he groped;<pb n="304" xml:id="VAB7167-306"/> but each branch as he touched it broke off, and
                        the earth was covered with cinders. At every step his foot sank in, and a
                        fine cloud of impalpable ashes flew up into his face; and it was dark. So he
                        sat down upon a stone and buried his face in his hands, to wait in the Land
                        of Negation and Denial till the light came.</p>
                    <p>And it was night in his heart also.</p>
                    <p>Then from the marshes to his right and left cold mists arose and closed about
                        him. A fine, imperceptible rain fell in the dark, and great drops gathered
                        on his hair and clothes. His heart beat slowly, and a numbness crept through
                        all his limbs. Then, looking up, two merry wisp lights came dancing. He
                        lifted his head to look at them. Nearer, nearer they came. So warm, so
                        bright, they danced like stars of fire. They stood before him at last. From
                        the centre of the radiating flame in one looked out a woman's face,
                        laughing, dimpled, with streaming yellow hair. In the centre of the other
                        were merry<pb n="305" xml:id="VAB7167-307"/> laughing ripples, like the
                        bubbles on a glass of wine. They danced before him.</p>
                    <p>âWho are you,â asked the hunter, âwho alone come to me in my solitude and
                        darkness?â</p>
                    <p>âWe are the twins Sensuality,â they cried. âOur father's name is
                        Human-Nature, and our mother's name is Excess. We are as old as the hills
                        and rivers, as old as the first man; but we never die,â they laughed.</p>
                    <p>âOh, let me wrap my arms about you!â cried the first; âthey are soft and
                        warm. Your heart is frozen now, but I will make it beat. Oh, come to
                        me!â</p>
                    <p>âI will pour my hot life into you,â said the second; âyour brain is numb, and
                        your limbs are dead now; but they shall live with a fierce free life. Oh,
                        let me pour it in!â</p>
                    <p>âOh, follow us,â they cried, âand live with us. Nobler hearts than yours have
                        sat here in this darkness to wait, and they have come to us and we to them;
                        and they have never left<pb n="306" xml:id="VAB7167-308"/> us, never. All
                        else is a delusion, but <emph>we</emph> are real, we are real. Truth is a
                        shadow; the valleys of superstition are a farce: the earth is of ashes, the
                        trees all rotten; but weâfeel usâwe live! You cannot doubt us. Feel us how
                        warm we are! Oh, come to us! Oh, live with us!â</p>
                    <p>Nearer and nearer round his head they hovered, and the cold drops melted on
                        his forehead. The bright light shot into his eyes, dazzling him, and the
                        frozen blood began to run. And he saidâ</p>
                    <p>âYes, why should I die here in this awful darkness? They are warm, they are
                        warm!â and he stretched out his hands to take them.</p>
                    <p>Then in a moment there arose before him the image of the thing he had loved,
                        and his hand dropped to his side.</p>
                    <p>âOh, come to us!â they cried.</p>
                    <p>But he buried his face.</p>
                    <p>âYou dazzle my eyes,â he cried, âyou make my heart warm; but you cannot give
                        me what<pb n="307" xml:id="VAB7167-309"/> I desire. I will wait hereâwait
                        till I die; but I will not follow you. Go!â</p>
                    <p>He covered his face with his hands and would not listen; and when he looked
                        up again they were two twinkling stars, that vanished in the distance.</p>
                    <p>And the long, long night rolled on.</p>
                    <p>All who leave the valley of superstition pass through that dark land; but
                        some go through it in a few days, some linger there for months, some for
                        years, and some die there.</p>
                    <p>At last for the hunter a faint light played along the horizon, and he rose to
                        follow it.â</p>
                    <p>The boy had crept closer; his hot breath almost touched the stranger's hand;
                        a mystic wonder filled his eyes.</p>
                    <p>âHe reached that light at last, and stepped into the broad sunshine,â said
                        the stranger. âThen before him rose the almighty mountains of Dry-facts and
                        Realities. The clear sunshine played on them, and the tops were lost in<pb n="308" xml:id="VAB7167-310"/> the clouds. At the foot many paths ran
                        up. An exultant cry burst from the hunter. He chose the straightest and
                        began to climb; and the rocks and ridges resounded with his song. They had
                        exaggerated; after all, it was not so high, nor was the road so steep! A few
                        days, a few weeks, a few months at most, and then the top! Not one feather
                        only would he pick up; he would gather all that other men had foundâweave
                        the netâcapture Truthâhold her fastâtouch her with his handsâclasp her!</p>
                    <p>He laughed in the merry sunshine, and sang loud. Victory was very near.
                        Nevertheless, after a while the path grew steeper. He needed all his breath
                        for climbing, and the singing died away. On the right and left rose huge
                        rocks, devoid of lichen or moss, and in the lava-like earth chasms yawned.
                        Here and there he saw a sheen of white bones. Now too the path began to grow
                        less and<pb n="309" xml:id="VAB7167-311"/> less marked; then it became a
                        mere trace, with a footmark here and there; then it ceased altogether. He
                        sang no more, but struck forth a path for himself, until it reached a mighty
                        wall of rock, smooth and without break, stretching as far as the eye could
                        see. âI will rear a stair against it; and, once this wall climbed, I shall
                        be almost there,â he said bravely; and set to work. With his shuttle of
                        imagination he dug out stones; but half of them would not fit, and sometimes
                        half a month's work would roll down because those below were ill chosen. But
                        the hunter worked on, saying always to himself, âOnce this wall climbed, I
                        shall be almost there. This great work ended!â</p>
                    <p>At last he came out upon the top, and he looked about him. Far below rolled
                        the white mist over the valleys of superstition, and above towered the
                        mountains. They had seemed low before; they were of an immeasurable height
                        now, from crown to foundation surrounded by<pb n="310" xml:id="VAB7167-312"/> walls of rock, that rose tier above tier in mighty circles. Upon them
                        played the eternal sunshine. He uttered a wild cry. When he rose from the
                        earth on which he had fallen, his face was white. In absolute silence he
                        walked on. He was very silent now. In those high regions the rarefied air is
                        hard to breathe by those born in the valleys; every breath he drew hurt him,
                        and the blood oozed out from the tips of his fingers. Before the next wall
                        of rock he began to work. The height of this seemed infinite, and he said
                        nothing. The sound of his tool rang night and day upon the iron rocks into
                        which he cut steps. Times and times, and again times, passed over him, yet
                        he worked on; but the wall towered up above him to heaven. Sometimes he
                        prayed that a little moss or lichen might spring up on those bare walls to
                        be a companion to him; but it never came.</p>
                    <p>And the years rolled on; he counted them<pb n="311" xml:id="VAB7167-313"/> by
                        the steps he had cutâa few for a yearâonly a few. He sang no more; he said
                        no more, âI will do this, or thatââhe only worked. And at night, when the
                        twilight settled down, there looked out at him from the holes and crevices
                        in the rocks strange wild faces.</p>
                    <p>âStop your work, you lonely man, and speak to us,â they cried.</p>
                    <p>âMy salvation is in work. If I should stop but for one moment you would creep
                        down upon me,â he replied. And they put out their long necks further.</p>
                    <p>âLook down into the crevice at your feet,â they said. âSee what lie
                        thereâwhite bones! As brave and strong a man as you climbed to these rocks.â
                        And he looked up. He saw there was no use; he would never hold Truth, never
                        see her, never find her. So he lay down here, for he was very tired. He went
                        to sleep for ever. He put himself to sleep. Sleep is very tranquil. You are
                        not lonely when you<pb n="312" xml:id="VAB7167-314"/> are asleep, neither do
                        your hands ache, nor your heart. And the hunter laughed between his teeth.â
                        And the hunter laughed between his teeth.</p>
                    <p>âHave I torn from my heart all that was dearest; have I wandered alone in the
                        land of night; have I resisted temptation; have I dwelt where the voice of
                        my kind is never heard, and laboured alone, to lie down and be food for you,
                        ye harpies?â</p>
                    <p>He laughed fiercely; and the Echoes of Despair slunk away, for the laugh of a
                        brave, strong heart is as a death blow to them.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless they crept out again and looked at him.</p>
                    <p>âDo you know that your hair is white?â they said, âthat your hands begin to
                        tremble like a child's? Do you see that the point of your shuttle is
                        gone?âit is cracked already. If you should ever climb this stair,â they
                        said, âit will be your last. You will never climb another.â</p>
                    <pb n="313" xml:id="VAB7167-315"/>
                    <p>And he answered, â<emph>I know it!</emph>â and worked on.</p>
                    <p>The old, thin hands cut the stones ill and jaggedly, for the fingers were
                        stiff and bent. The beauty and the strength of the man was gone.</p>
                    <p>At last, an old, wizened, shrunken face looked out above the rocks. It saw
                        the eternal mountains rise with walls to the white clouds; but its work was
                        done.</p>
                    <p>The old hunter folded his tired hands and lay down by the precipice where he
                        had worked away his life. It was the sleeping time at last. Below him over
                        the valleys rolled the thick white mist. Once it broke; and through the gap
                        the dying eyes looked down on the trees and fields of their childhood. From
                        afar seemed borne to him the cry of his own wild birds, and he heard the
                        noise of people singing as they danced. And he thought he heard among them
                        the voices of his old comrades; and he saw far off the sunlight shine on his
                        early home. And great tears gathered in the hunter's eyes.</p>
                    <pb n="314" xml:id="VAB7167-316"/>
                    <p>âAh! they who die there do not die alone,â he cried.</p>
                    <p>Then the mists rolled together again; and he turned his eyes away.</p>
                    <p>âI have sought,â he said, âfor long years I have laboured; but I have not
                        found her. I have not rested, I have not repined, and I have not seen her;
                        now my strength is gone. Where I lie down worn out other men will stand,
                        young and fresh. By the steps that I have cut they will climb; by the stairs
                        that I have built they will mount. They will never know the name of the man
                        who made them. At the clumsy work they will laugh; when the stones roll they
                        will curse me. But they will mount, and on <emph>my</emph> work; they will
                        climb, and by <emph>my</emph> stair! They will find her, and through me! And
                        no man liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.â</p>
                    <p>The tears rolled from beneath the shrivelled eyelids. If Truth had appeared
                        above him<pb n="315" xml:id="VAB7167-317"/> in the clouds now he could not
                        have seen her.</p>
                    <p>âMy soul hears their glad step coming,â he said; âand they shall mount! they
                        shall mount!â He raised his shrivelled hand to his eyes.</p>
                    <p>Then slowly from the white sky above, through the still air, came something
                        falling, falling, falling. Softly it fluttered down, and dropped on to the
                        breast of the dying man. He felt it with his hands. It was a feather. He
                        died holding it.â</p>
                    <p>The boy had shaded his eyes with his hand. On the wood of the carving great
                        drops fell. The stranger must have laughed outright, or remained silent and
                        somewhat solemn.</p>
                    <p>âHow did you know it?â the boy whispered at last. âIt is not written
                        thereânot on that wood. How did you know it?â</p>
                    <p>âCertainly,â said the stranger, âthe whole of the story is not written here,
                        but it is suggested. And the attribute of all true art, the highest and<pb n="316" xml:id="VAB7167-318"/> the lowest, is thisâthat it says more
                        than it says, and takes you away from itself. It is a little door that opens
                        into an infinite hall where you may find what you please. Men, thinking to
                        detract, say, âPeople read more in this or that work of genius than was ever
                        written in it,â not perceiving that they pay the highest compliment. If we
                        pick up the finger and nail of a real man, we can decipher a whole
                        storyâcould almost reconstruct the creature again, from head to foot. But
                        half the body of a Mumboo-jumbow idol leaves us utterly in the dark as to
                        what the rest was like. We see what we see, but nothing more. There is
                        nothing so universally intelligible as truth. It has a thousand meanings,
                        and suggests a thousand more, all true. Though a man should carve it into
                        matter with the least possible manipulative skill, it will yet find
                        interpreters. It is the soul that looks out with burning eyes through the
                        most gross fleshly filament. It is that which is universal. Whosoever
                            should<pb n="317" xml:id="VAB7167-319"/> portray truly the life and
                        death of a little flower,âits birth, sucking in of nourishment, waxing,
                        reproduction of its kind, withering and vanishing,âwould have shaped a
                        symbol of all existence. All true facts of nature or the mind are related.
                        Your little carving represents a mental fact as it really is, therefore
                        fifty different true stories might be read from it. What your work wants is
                        not truth, but beauty of external form, the other half of art. Skill may
                        come in time, but you will have to work hard. The love of beauty and the
                        desire for it must be born in a man; the skill to reproduce it he must
                        make.â</p>
                    <p>Having delivered himself of these paradoxes, for the purpose of observing
                        their effect upon his listener, the stranger broke off the end of a cigar
                        and lit it.</p>
                    <p>âAll my life I have longed to see you,â the boy said.</p>
                    <p>He lifted the heavy wood from the stranger's knee and drew yet nearer him. In
                        the dog-like<pb n="318" xml:id="VAB7167-320"/> manner of his drawing near
                        there was something superbly ridiculous, unless one chanced to view it in
                        another light. Presently the stranger said, whiffing, âDo something for
                        me.â</p>
                    <p>The boy started up.</p>
                    <p>âNo; stay where you are. I don't want you to go anywhere; I want you to talk
                        to me. Tell me what you have been doing all your life.â</p>
                    <p>The boy slunk down again. Would that the man had asked him to root up bushes
                        with his hands for his horse to feed on; or to run to the far end of the
                        plain for the fossils that lay there; or to gather the flowers that grew on
                        the far low hills; he would have run and been back quicklyâbut now!</p>
                    <p>âI have never done anything,â he said.</p>
                    <p>âThen tell me of that nothing. I like to know what other folks have been
                        doing whose word I can believe. It is interesting. What was the first thing
                        you ever wanted very much?â</p>
                    <p>The boy waited to remember, then began<pb n="319" xml:id="VAB7167-321"/>
                        hesitatingly, but soon the words flowed. In the smallest past we find an
                        inexhaustible mine when once we begin to dig at it. We stare ourselves at
                        the things we draw forth when for another we disturb the days of old.</p>
                    <p>A confused, disordered story it wasâthe little made large and the large
                        small, and nothing showing its inward meaning. It is not till the past has
                        receded many steps that before the clearest eyes it falls into co-ordinate
                        pictures. It is not till the I we tell of has ceased to exist, that it takes
                        its place among other objective realities, and finds its true niche in the
                        picture. The present and the near past is a confusion, whose meaning flashes
                        on us as it slinks away into the distance.</p>
                    <p>The stranger lit one cigar from the end of another, and puffed and listened,
                        with half-closed eyes.</p>
                    <p>âI will remember more to tell you if you like,â said the boy.</p>
                    <pb n="320" xml:id="VAB7167-322"/>
                    <p>He spoke with that extreme gravity common to all very young things who feel
                        deeply. It is not till twenty that we learn to be in deadly earnest and to
                        laugh. The stranger nodded, while the fellow sought for something more to
                        relate. He would tell all to this man of hisâall that he knew, all that he
                        had felt, his inmost sorest thought. Suddenly the stranger turned upon
                        him.</p>
                    <p>âBoy,â he said, âyou are happy to be here.â</p>
                    <p>Waldo looked at him. Was his delightful one ridiculing him? Here, with this
                        brown earth and these low hills! while the rare wonderful world lay all
                        beyond them! Fortunate to be here!</p>
                    <p>The stranger read his glance.</p>
                    <p>âYes,â he said; âhere with the karroo-bushes and red sand. You wonder what I
                        mean? To all who have been born in the old faith there comes a time of
                        danger, when the old slips from us, and we have not yet planted our feet on
                        the new; when the voice from Sinai<pb n="321" xml:id="VAB7167-323"/>
                        thunders no more, and the still small voice of reason is not yet heard. We
                        have proved the religion our mothers fed us on to be a delusion; in our
                        bewilderment we see no rule by which to guide our steps day by day; and yet
                        every day we must step somewhere. We have never once been taught by word or
                        act to distinguish between religion and the moral laws on which it has
                        artfully fastened itself, and from which it has sucked its vitality. When we
                        have dragged down the weeds and creepers that covered the solid wall and
                        have found them to be rotten wood, we imagine the wall itself to be rotten
                        wood too. We find it is solid and standing only when we fall headlong
                        against it. We have been taught that all right and wrong originate in the
                        will of an irresponsible being. It is some time before we see how the
                        inexorable âThou shalt and shalt not,â are carved into the nature of things.
                        This is the time of danger.</p>
                    <p>âIn the end experience will inevitably teach<pb n="322" xml:id="VAB7167-324"/> us that the laws for a wise and noble life have a foundation infinitely
                        deeper than the fiat of any being, God or man, even in the groundwork of
                        human nature. She will teach us that whoso sheddeth man's blood, though by
                        man his blood be not shed, though no man avenge and no hell await; yet every
                        drop shall blister on his soul and eat in the name of the dead. She will
                        teach that whoso takes a love not lawfully his own, gathers a flower with a
                        poison on its petals; that whoso revenges, strikes with a sword that has two
                        edgesâone for his adversary,âone for himself; that who lives to himself is
                        dead, though the ground is not yet on him; that who wrongs another clouds
                        his own sun; and that who sins in secret stands accursed and condemned
                        before the one Judge who deals eternal justiceâhis own all-knowing self.</p>
                    <p>âExperience <emph>will</emph> teach us this, and reason will show us why it
                            <emph>must</emph> be so; but at first the world swings before our eyes,
                        and no voice cries<pb n="323" xml:id="VAB7167-325"/> out, âThis is the way,
                        walk ye in it!â Boy, you are happy to be here! When the suspense fills you
                        with pain you build stone walls and dig earth for relief. Others have stood
                        where you stand to-day, and have felt as you feel; and another relief has
                        been offered them, and they have taken it.</p>
                    <p>âWhen the day has come when they have seen the path in which they might walk,
                        they have not the strength to follow it. Habits have fastened on them from
                        which nothing but death can free them; which cling closer than his
                        sacerdotal sanctimony to a priest; which feed on the intellect like a worm
                        sapping energy, hope, creative power, resolution, all that makes a man
                        higher than a beastâleaving only the power to yearn, to regret, and to sink
                        lower in the abyss.</p>
                    <p>âBoy,â he said, and the listener was not more unsmiling now than the speaker,
                        âyou are happy to be here! Stay where you are. If you ever pray, let it be
                        only the one old prayerâ<pb n="324" xml:id="VAB7167-326"/> âLead us not into
                        temptation.â Live on here quietly. The time may yet come when you will be
                        that which other men have hoped to be and never will be now.â</p>
                    <p>The stranger rose, shook the dust from his sleeve, and half-ashamed of his
                        earnestness, looked across the bushes for his horse.</p>
                    <p>âWe should have been on our way already,â he said. âWe shall have a long ride
                        in the dark to-night.â</p>
                    <p>Waldo hastened to fetch the animal; but he returned leading it slowly. The
                        sooner it came the sooner would its rider be gone.</p>
                    <p>The stranger was opening his saddle-bag, in which were a bright French novel
                        and an old brown volume. He took the last and held it out to the boy.</p>
                    <p>âIt may be of some help to you. It was a gospel to me when I first fell on
                        it. You must not expect too much,â he said; âbut it may give you a centre
                        round which to organize<pb n="325" xml:id="VAB7167-327"/> your confused
                        ideas. We of this generation are not destined to eat and be satisfied as our
                        fathers were; but to search, and be hungry.â</p>
                    <p>He smiled his automaton smile, and rebuttoned the bag. Waldo thrust the book
                        into his breast, and while he saddled the horse the stranger made inquiries
                        as to the nature of the road and the distance to the next farm.</p>
                    <p>When the bags were fixed Waldo took up his wooden post and began to fasten it
                        on to the saddle, tying it with the little blue cotton handkerchief from his
                        neck. The stranger looked on in silence. When it was done the boy held the
                        stirrup for him to mount.</p>
                    <p>âWhat is your name?â he inquired, ungloving his right hand when he was in the
                        saddle.</p>
                    <p>The boy replied.</p>
                    <p>âWell, I trust we shall meet again some day, sooner or later.â</p>
                    <p>He shook hands with the ungloved hand; then drew on the glove, touched his
                        horse, and<pb n="326" xml:id="VAB7167-328"/> rode slowly away. The boy stood
                        to watch him.</p>
                    <p>Once when the stranger had gone half across the plain he looked back.</p>
                    <p>âPoor devil,â he said, smiling and stroking his moustache. Then he looked to
                        see if the little blue handkerchief were still safely knotted. âPoor
                        devil!â</p>
                    <p>He smiled, and then he sighed wearily, very wearily.</p>
                    <p>And Waldo waited till the moving speck had disappeared on the horizon; then
                        he stooped and kissed passionately a hoof-mark in the sand. Then he called
                        his young birds together, and put his book under his arm, and walked home
                        along the stone wall. There was a rare beauty to him in the sunshine that
                        evening.</p>
