            <p rend="center">THE CALL OF THE WEST</p>
            <p>In the quarter-century following the War of 1812, Amos Lane was a familiar figure in southeastern
                    Indiana as he traveled the ill-kept roads and bridle-paths of the third judicial circuit, astride
                    his sixty-dollar horse, "Big Sorrel." The fashionable eel-skin queue and
                    "wilted rorum hat" identified him as an itinerant attorney. Eager for political
                    advancement, he mingled in the court yard with tillers of the soil and hewers of wood and won a seat
                    in the lower branch of the first state legislature, which elevated him to the speakership at its
                    second session. A weathervane in politics, he renounced the nationalism of Adams and Clay for the
                    more popular democracy of Andrew Jackson. Although he boasted "That he wore no collar-no
                    man's yoke," so ardently did he defend his hero in congress that he earned the
                    sobriquet of "Wheel Horse." He surpassed his idol in one respect at least; he
                    could swear mightier oaths than even the proficient Jackson. A contemporary asserted that when he
                    mounted the stump and hurled sarcasm and invective at his political opponents, he was
                    "heard to grit and grind his teeth together fifty yards."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    Indeed his long and loud ebullient tirades annoyed his enemies, and they dubbed him "the
                    Ajax Telamon of the Party." Like his Greek prototype, he was always ready to defend his
                    personal honor, although it is not of record that he ever served in the army.</p>
            <p>Amos Lane was not numbered among the great men of his generation, yet as an advocate of western
                    democracy his political career is a fascinating one. He belonged to that stream <list type="footnotes">

                    political life and wider industrial opportunity."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The influences of

                    After trying his hand at school teaching during his nineteenth year,<hi rend="sup">6</hi> he began
                    the study of law as a clerk in the office of Joseph L. Richardson at Levanna, a few miles north of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. He remained in that office from September 12, 1803, until February 21, 1805, when he
                    was granted a certificate of good moral character.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Lane then entered the law

                    Shepard awarded him a certificate of character and a letter of introduction to his brother-in-law,
                    Jacob Brown, a resident of St. Lawrence county in the northern part of the state. "The

            </p>
            <p>Lane's ambition to become a lawyer was strengthened by his marriage in 1804 to a capable
                    woman, Mrs. Mary Howes, a daughter of the Revolutionary veteran, John Foote. Mrs. Lane was born in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ctu">Connecticut</country>
                    </placeName> of <placeName>

            <p>It was some time before Lane found a satisfactory location. He returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Aurora</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1806, and the following year emigrated to Steubenville in eastern <placeName>

                    </placeName> bar, but his application was rejected, he later explained, because "he was an
                    ardent friend of Thomas Jefferson." The county officials were Federalists and
                    "were not inclined to show favor to anyone who was not of their household of
                        faith".<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Older accounts state that Lane was so "incensed
                    at this rebuff" that he immediately crossed the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="kyu">Kentucky</country>
                    </placeName> side. It is of record, however, that the <placeName>

                    </placeName> court of common pleas at its April term, 1810, certified "that Amos Lane, a
                    citizen of … this territory, is of good moral character."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                    However that may be, Lane moved to a certain Judge Piatt's farm in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. He soon became dissatisfied, built a large canoe and, accompanied by his wife, floated
                    his scanty household goods some fifty miles down the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> to Carrollton,

                        <region type="county">Boone county</region>
                    </placeName> and settled at Touseytown, directly opposite <placeName>

                    Clerks though honest possessed few qualifications. Sheriffs were elected because of "their

                    means of special committees, and Lane's name appeared on almost every one appointed. On

                    them. These were to consider those portions of the governor's message which recommended a

                    served a third term, 1821-1822,<hi rend="sup">52</hi> and during that session he was chairman of the

                    asserting that other qualifications than "military talents and fame" were
                    necessary for office, denying that Jackson possessed "sufficient diplomatic information and
                    experience" to exercise executive power, and declaring "That we do not believe

            <p>Lane was a veteran in politics when he began his quadrennium in congress, and at once entered

                    the point, when necessary, as well on the floor of Congress as elsewhere—though his

                    advocacy of measures peculiarly western. As the sessions drew to a close and the house began to
                    discuss adjournment, Lane would plead that "not a bill in which the West was interested had

            <p>John Quincy Adams recorded in his diary, however, "That there had not been a quorum in the
                    House one-third of the time while Lane was speaking." The member from Indiana, he said,
                    "was charged with a speech of an hour" on <placeName>

                    accordingly delivered—a full glorification of Martin Van Buren."<hi rend="sup">91</hi> But Lane was willing to cross swords with Adams. About a year before he recalled
                    "A day when by <hi rend="i">management,</hi> and by means of which it becomes us not to
                    speak, eighty-<hi rend="i">four</hi> was made to prevail over ninety-nine."<hi rend="sup">92</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On at least one occasion Lane was very unfortunate in the outcome of a personal altercation. Two of
                    his colleagues from Indiana, Jonathan McCarty and John Ewing, supported an investigation of alleged
                    frauds committed by Indian agents. Lane desired to correct the impression that any such frauds had
                    been committed in Indiana. He had known the agents there for twenty years and declared that they
                    were "incapable of committing a fraud." As was his habit he seized the opportunity
                    to eulogize his constituents and those of his colleagues. "Sir," he said,
                    "a purer, more intelligent, high-minded, and honorable population than that of Indiana,
                    cannot be found in any other State."<hi rend="sup">93</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It soon appeared that Lane had accused his colleagues of locating the frauds in Indiana, but later
                    wrote a speech for publication in the <hi rend="i">Globe</hi> in which the tone of his remarks was
                    softened. The gratutious eulogy which Lane had pronounced, said Ewing, was "uncalled
                    for," as the reputation of the people of Indiana had not been questioned. Lane then
                    reproached Ewing for claiming "the exclusive privilege of eulogizing and defending his own
                    constituents." Further, when he desired "to impugn the motives" of his
                    colleagues, "he would do it elsewhere than in that House; he would do it as a gentleman,
                    and not in a manner to protect himself with the splendid walls <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>A few days later McCarty replied at length. Regardless of repeated disclaimers that he had not made
                    charges against any particular district, he said, Lane continued his false accusations. It was his
                    duty to "expose this mis-representation, which was intended to operate more <hi rend="i">elsewhere</hi> than here." Even in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn county</region>
                    </placeName> acts had transpired "not <hi rend="i">altogether consistent with honesty and
                        fair-dealing."</hi> Nor was his resolution introduced "for the purpose of
                    ferreting out and making charges against the administration." He was, in fact, "an
                    older soldier in the support of the administration than" Lane. He likened that gentleman to
                    "a species of animals in our forests, with whom, notwithstanding their weakness and abject
                    meanness of spirit, the lion himself would shun a controversy."<hi rend="sup">95</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ewing added his chastisement of Lane's conduct. He informed him that "The people
                    require services, not flattery;" that the house was "no place to play the
                    braggart," that the "peril" to which he alluded was
                    "fudge," that he did not seek the "protection from the walls, dome, or
                    drapery," that he held himself "personally responsible" for his remarks
                    there or elsewhere, and Lane "may pursue what course he chooses." He would admit,
                    however, that his colleague manifested "art" in his attempts "to injure
                    faithful Representatives at home."<hi rend="sup">96</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The controversy had taken a turn unforseen by Lane. Realizing that he was getting the worst of it, he
                    attempted to divert attention of members to the fact that they were "in the house of
                    mourning" for the loss of one of their number. Recoiling into his shell of
                    "saint-like sanctity," he placed himself above the petty controversies of this
                    world: "Sir, there is a manner, a language, a courtesy, a delicacy, and sweetness of
                    expression, in the heat of even angry debate, that characterises the gentleman and the
                    scholar—a language, a look, that distinguishes him from the vulgar ruffian. To look at
                    such a man is to know him a gentleman, elevated in mind, pure in thought, sensitive in feeling,

                    pattern to his colleagues, but if contrary to his "wishes and intentions, a claim should be
                    asserted, I assure the House … that nothing shall be charged for the cutting or the

                    been absent at roll-call eighty-two times and Ewing forty-seven. On these "occasions, what
                    would have been the condition of their constituents, had their honor or their interests required an
                        advocate?"<hi rend="sup">98</hi> But the point was seized by McCarty and Ewing, and
                    they renewed the attack. It was known that Lane had been "filching" extracts from
                    the clerk's records regarding their absences, which he had published in their districts.
                    But that he had "voluntarily given testimony to his own depravity" was

                                advised the secretary of war, after reading the report, that John Lane's action
                                "was highly improper, and deserves reproof: but as neither the committee of the

                    a waste of time. Six weeks, he said, had been consumed "in the presentation and
                    consideration of memorials and resolutions on the subject of abolition from the North, to the entire
                    exclusion of all petitions and memorials from the western States and Territories. Having, after this

                    from this all exciting subject. In this it seems we are mistaken. The fire brands of abolition seem
                    to thicken around us from the south, and threaten equal if not more delay. To avert this storm, and
                    to enable the people of the west to be heard in this House, <hi rend="i">he</hi> would move the
                    previous question." The house voted to sustain the decision of the chair, and the memorial
                    was referred without instructions.<hi rend="sup">107</hi>

            <p>On May 25 and 26 an exciting debate occurred on resolutions presented by Henry L. Pinckney of <placeName>
                        <country reg="scu">South Carolina</country>
                    </placeName>, from the select committee on abolition. Especially was the controversy warm between
                    Speaker Polk and John Quincy Adams. The latter observed "that a slaveholding Speaker
                    occupied the Chair," and was at once called to order by several members. The previous
                    question cut off debate, and Adams after taking various appeals from the chair's decisions,
                    exclaimed, "Mr. Speaker, am I gagged or not?"<hi rend="sup">108</hi> The house
                    adopted the first resolution on the 25th and the second and third on the 26th. The resolution
                    "That Congress possesses no constitutional authority to interfere in any way with the
                    institution of slavery in any of the States of this Confederacy," passed, 182 to 9, Lane

            <p>The following year, 1837, another great debate grew out of the presentation of abolition petitions,
                    and occupied the attention of the house for four days, February 6, 7, 9, and 11. After having
                    presented a number of such petitions, Adams inquired of the speaker if a paper which "came
                    from twenty persons declaring themselves to be slaves" would come "under the
                    rule." The chair said the case was novel, and requested the "advice and
                    counsel" of the house. Southern representatives were much alarmed. Charles E. Haynes of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> "moved that the petition be not received," but immediately withdrew
                    the motion. Dixon H. Lewis of <placeName>
                        <country reg="alu">Alabama</country>
                    </placeName> "thought that the Representatives of the slaveholding States should <hi rend="i">demand</hi> that the <hi rend="i">attempt to introduce such a petition</hi> should
                    instantly put in requisition the power of the House to punish the member for such attempt. If this
                    is not done, and that promptly, every member from the slave States should immediately, <hi rend="i">in a body, quit this House,</hi> and go home to their constituents. We have no longer any

            </p>
            <p>It soon developed that the memorial prayed that abolitionists desist from presenting their petitions.
                    The resolutions were then modified by declaring that Adams had "trifled with the
                    House" in creating a wrong impression.<hi rend="sup">112</hi> On the last day of the debate
                    Lane obtained the floor.</p>
            <p>"That Congress have no power to interfere with slavery, as it exists in the
                    States," he said, "is a proposition too clear to admit of a doubt. The wildest

                    "would be injurious to that species of property, in the hands of the owners in the
                    neighborhood of the District, and fearfully dangerous to the tranquillity of the Union." He
                    then explained what abolitionists desired: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>They set forth that, in their opinion, slavery, in the abstract, is a great moral, political,

                    Revolution and the treaty of Greenville. Lane declared "that a body of more meritorious men

                    "indolence for industry and enterprise," and that additional pensions would

            <p>Lane was a strong advocate of the graduation bill. It was one, he said, "in which the
                    western people had more at stake, and felt a more lively interest in than any other".<hi rend="sup">125</hi> The first resolution he introduced in congress was one suggesting reduction
                    in price to actual settlers, of lands which had been on the market for fifteen years, with
                    preëmption rights for squatters.<hi rend="sup">126</hi> A year later, December, 1834, he
                    introduced a similar resolution which would permit cultivators to enter a quarter-section of land
                    remaining unsold after twenty years, at fifty cents an acre.<hi rend="sup">127</hi> Such a measure,
                    he said, "will give homes, and ease, and independence, to thousands of our honest and
                    intelligent, but less fortunate fellow-citizens."<hi rend="sup">128</hi> For the benefit of

            <p>It would seem that registers and receivers of the public land offices were unpopular with Lane. On
                    two occasions he successfully opposed further compensation for them. On December 22, 1834, a bill
                    was introduced authorizing them to administer oaths in the entry or purchase of public lands, and
                    receive compensation therefor at the legal rate. Lane offered an amendment making it their duty to
                    administer such oaths without remuneration. He explained that their income was already so great that
                    the positions "were eagerly sought after". Although the salary was only
                    $500, they received in addition one per cent on sales and a commission on deposits,
                    making the total in many cases from $1,500 to $3,000 a year. If they were
                    further compensated for administering oaths, some would receive as much as $5,000.<hi rend="sup">130</hi> Again on April, 15, 1836, he successfully opposed an amendment to pay land

            <p>Lane opposed the distribution of the proceeds from the sale of western lands. Henry Clay, who
                    advocated the policy, persistently brought forward such bills only to see them fail in the lower
                    house or receive the executive's veto. A bill passed the senate in May, 1835, but was
                    tabled in the house.<hi rend="sup">132</hi> Lane argued that it might "dry up all the
                    streams of emigration to the west, and check her growing prosperity." Further, it would
                    "convert the General Government to tax-gatherers, and the West and South to
                    tax-payers." He saw in the measure only the desire of a political party to win me

            <p>At the next session of congress, Chilton Allan of <placeName>
                        <country reg="kyu">Kentucky</country>
                    </placeName> introduced a distribution resolution in the house. He proposed that public lands be

                    purposes of education and internal improvements. The land grants were to be sold under the existing
                    federal laws, the proceeds to be turned over to the enumerated states. The proposition, Lane said,
                    was unfair for two reasons. In the first place the newer states had received their lands when their
                    population was only a third of what it was at present. Thus <placeName>

                    </placeName> had been granted, although they had less population. In the second place, some of the
                    new states had received their land on condition that they would not tax government lands for five
                    years after their sale, and that the government should retain all minerals and salt springs. The new
                    states had received their shares <quote rend="blockquote">

                            comfort, and luxury; or those hardy pioneers who went into the wilderness, subdued the
                            savage, and made it smile and blossom as the rose? The old States, by this resolution, were

                    "the dictates of his own conscience and judgment," influenced only by
                    "the interest and prosperity of his constituents, the State, and the Union." He
                    would compare votes with Dunlap and prove himself the more efficient and loyal supporter of the

                    </placeName> with restrictions. He would apportion the capital stock among the states according to
                    representation in congress, and limit the number of shares an individual might hold. Foreigners
                    should be incapable of holding stock, but should be allowed five years to dispose of their shares.
                    The Bank should be prohibited from holding real estate, for that "privilege has converted
                    the Bank into a speculator and a landlord with numerous and dependant tenantry." Finally,
                    the stock should "be liable by state laws to the same tax as other funded
                        property."<hi rend="sup">141</hi>

            <p>On March 29, 1834, Lane wrote a letter which received a great deal of publicity and occasioned much
                    comment. The following paragraph is significant: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            government. An institution, in strict obediance to, and not above the constitution and the
                            laws-an institution that shall furnish a sound currency, and relieve the country from its
                            present suffering; an institution that shall collect, keep and disburse the revenue of the
                            nation, with ease and safety; an institution for the benefit of the people, <hi rend="i">for

            <p>"For such an institution", said Lane, "my exertions and vote shall be
                    given." Although "the sins of the present bank" prevented its recharter,
                    "Public and individual necessity may, however, call for the temporary extension of its
                    charter," until "a new and safe one can be brought into action and useful

                    </placeName>, in which he expressed the opinion "that a bank of some kind will be chartered

                    any evidence … before the committee of this House." This was proof enough, he
                    thought, that the Bank had violated its charter, corrupted the press, interfered with elections,
                    caused distress, and created loss of confidence.<hi rend="sup">146</hi>

            <p>But if Lane was apparently out of harmony with the administration in predicting that some kind of a

                    42 speaking engagements, covering a period from June 10 to July 22. He had not intended to canvass
                    the district, he said, as every one knew "his fitness or unfitness" for the
                    position he sought. But the "fearful and alarming" financial situation in the
                    state demanded that he "give correct information to the people, in order that the
                    individuals who have brought them into so much difficulty, and embarrassment, and the State to the

                            that he is an aged man. If the contractor's relief is his subject, he portrays, in
                            glowing colors, his sufferings; the plighted faith of the State; and denounces in terms of
                            bitterness, the ‘State Scrip’ system, as one that would prove ruinous
                            in its consequences to that portion of the community which it was intended to
                            benefit—the laboring portion, that has thrown up our embankments, and excavated
                            our canals. Such is a brief outline of the Hon. Amos Lane, of <placeName>

                            consideration. In short, his mind is replete with the rich and well treasured stores of
                            forty years experience; and notwithstanding weight of years hang heavily upon him, he still
                            retains the energy and vivacity of youth.<hi rend="sup">181</hi>

            <p>Lane's report on internal improvements, eighteen pages long in the House <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, <hi rend="sup">182</hi> is an elaborate treatment of the subject, embodying a
                    history of "the system," a statement of present status, and recommendations for
                    the future. The scheme, he said, emanated not from the people, but from Governor Noah Noble,
                    "in all the force of language and official influence." A bill providing for
                    surveys and estimates was rushed through the legislature, followed by a campaign of propaganda to
                    convince the people that the enterprise should be undertaken. The committee on canals and internal
                    improvements, as well as the governor, had assured them that the financial problem was a simple one.
                    He produced evidence to show the fallacy in the assertions of Noble and Chief Engineer Jesse L.
                    Williams, "that the works, as soon as completed, would be sources of revenue."
                    Even the improvements in <placeName>

                    </placeName> Gregg, editor of the <hi rend="i">Political Beacon</hi>, which arose out of their past
                    records on internal improvements. Amos Lane, "the great Ajax Telamon of the
                    Party," met Gregg on the street and opened fire. "<hi rend="i">Alarmed at you

                    issue of his paper, Gregg devoted five columns of the first page to an "Address to the

                    abuse," and compared him "with such distinguished personages as <hi rend="i">Benedict Arnold and Judas Iscariot</hi>." In reply, Gregg reviewed Lane's
                    career as an advocate of internal improvements, printed in full his speech of welcome to De Witt
                    Clinton in 1825, and explained why "Ajax Telamon," "whose voice has often
                    resounded through the lofty dome of the American Capitol!" now condescended to seek a seat
                    in the lower house of the state legislature: "Methinks I see him fixing his ardent gaze
                    upon the gilded and gorgeous trappings of executive office, and executive honor; and if I am not

                            taunted the Democrats with their bad luck, but finally, about ten o'clock at night,
                            patience triumphed and a Polk and Dallas flag waved from the pole. Lane was the orator of

                    have drawn forth from him a more untiring effort than yourself, in whom principle, Patriotism and
                    warm personal friendship are so happily united." Lane received invitations from all parts
                    of the state to make addresses. "I have not a day or an hour I can call my own….

                        <country reg="kyu">Kentucky</country>
                    </placeName> backwoods-men, probably not much more advanced and probably not much more retarded than
                    the mountain people we now receive from the same state. These settled along the Whitewater from
                    Cleves, <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Some of these were squatters, furtraders, or "squawmen," like John
                    Conner, who traded near where Cedar Grove now stands before the opening of the nineteenth century.
                    Most of the early comers were restless, land hunting, Eldorado seeking people, now here, now there.
                    Much has been said, in justice, of their courage, pluck, endurance and other qualities, but it is
                    only a matter of history to add that many followed the lines of least resistance. It was often
                    easier to move and take new claims than to pay for old or pay taxes, light as they were, on old
                    claims. The Carolinians also came very early, and formed settlements along the Whitewater, on Blue
                    Creek and at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Between 1810 and 1820, there was an emigration to the county from <placeName>
                  <country>New
                        England</country>, <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName>, and especially
                    from <placeName>
                        <country reg="nju">New Jersey</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. Mixed with the three groups from older States were a few Hessians, assimilated into
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> Dutch element by this time, but with similar views and ambitions to those with whom
                    they settled.</p>
            <p>Since the schools of <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> and the Middle Atlantic States stood higher at this time than did those of the
                    Carolinas and Kentucky, one may infer that the second wave ranked higher educationally than the
                    first. However, some men included <pb n="219" id="VAA4025-026-3-043"/> among both the <placeName>
                        <country reg="vau">Virginia</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="kyu">Kentucky</country>
                    </placeName> settlers were men of college training.</p>
            <p>The early county maps show the characteristic southern and eastern family names. There appear such as
                    McCarty, Fuller, Breckenridge, Hackleman, Cooksey, Stoops, Wilson, Robinson, Jackson, Grant, etc. As
                    late as 1850, substantial farms were owned by a George Washington, an Andrew Jackson and a Nicholas
                    Longworth. But there was also a Halberstadt, a Siebenthaler, and others with similar names at a very
                    early time.</p>
            <p>In 1811 <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName> "became independent". Its first tax duplicate shows practically none
                    but <placeName>
                        <country reg="kyu">Kentucky</country>
                    </placeName> and Carolina names. Nothing was taxed save horses, mules,
                    slaves—thirty-seven and one-half cents for horses, one dollar per stallion, and fifty
                    cents for a bond servant. No part of the vast revenues thus obtained was intended for schools.</p>
            <p>How was the splendid vision of an educational system for-shadowed in the Ordinance of 1787 to become
                    a reality? The local schools were to be nurtured by the sale of section sixteen of each
                    Congressional Township. These sections, at the rate at which land was then selling, would have
                    brought from $1200 to $1600. The section sixteen which was located in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Highland</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township, one of the best in that unit, would at its present valuation run the schools
                    of that township less than three years. The same act of Congress which granted the lands gave the
                    salt springs to the people of the State for school purposes. As far as <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName> was concerned, it might just as well have given all the gold and diamond mines also, as
                    none of these "wonderful springs" existed in the County.</p>
            <p>The County seminaries, second "step in the educational ladder", were to be provided
                    "by moneys paid in lieu of military service and fines assessed for breach of penal
                    laws". "Proceeds of fines and forfeitures" are always small and
                    seminaries were put on a precarious footing.</p>
            <p>Much has been said of the farsightedness of the framers of the Ordinance of 1787 in regard to what
                    they did for education. Judged by our standard their plans or hopes seem entirely inadequate. None
                    could have dreamed of systems such as we have now. None had seen any but the simplest of schools.
                    Their great work consisted in suggesting a public <pb n="220" id="VAA4025-026-3-044"/> school
                    system, which would have to be supported in part at least by local units of government through
                    general taxation.</p>
            <p>To provide for starting a system of schools, the early courts appointed overseers or superintendents
                    and dictated rules for renting and leasing. Nothing is said about the terms, duties, or salaries of
                    the officials. Prabably they were mere creatures of the courts with little power and short tenure
                    something like our boards of charities at the present time. The Congressional Townships were kept
                    separate and distinct from the Civil Townships. This probably did not matter where the two types
                    happened to coincide, but in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName> as elsewhere this was true in only a few cases. Brook-ville Township is composed of
                    parts of six Congressional Townships. This phase of the system could only add to the general
                    confusion.</p>
            <p>Only a small amount of revenue came in from the sale of the Sixteenth Sections, none from salt lands,
                    while the proceeds of fines and forfeitures were small. Even the distribution under Jackson of a
                    part of the $38,000,000 Treasury surplus to the various states, and Indiana's
                    wise decision to put her share amounting to about $1,000,000 into a school fund could not
                    help much. Local taxation was badly needed, but early Indiana was not ready for that. During the
                    entire period which this paper attempts to cover, that from 1811 to 1850, available school funds
                    were always pitifully small and the best schools depended in part on fees.</p>
            <p>Long before the land grant sections were sold, schools sprang up in many parts of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName>. Some of these must have been established at a very early date. William McClure in his
                        <hi rend="i">Memoirs</hi> tells that he went to school near where Cedar Grove now stands with
                    James Conner, a half-breed Indian boy, and others in 1811-12. These schools were all subscription
                    schools open for very short terms. No records were kept and the first rooms were usually rented
                    wherever some wandering teacher could muster a sufficient number of pupils.</p>
            <p>It may be interesting to note where, according to "traditional history", the first
                    school houses stood in each Township. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bath</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township, in the southeast quarter of Section 36, on land now owned by Edith Gentry,
                    has the honor of establishing the first school. The earliest regular school house, however, was
                    where the town of Mixerville now stands. Both <pb n="221" id="VAA4025-026-3-045"/> structures were
                    built of logs. The first in Blooming Grove Township was built in 1817 or 1818, about a mile east of
                    the present town of Blooming Grove in the Harvey (<placeName>
                        <country reg="scu">South Carolina</country>
                    </placeName> settlers) neighborhood. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township was early settled, and probably had several schoolhouses at an early date, one
                    of which stood west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in the Stoops neighborhood. This was built by 1810 and was a typical example. It had
                    an earthen floor, puncheon furniture, and no windows, the light being admitted through oiled paper
                    or similar material where a log had been omitted, or a section cut out, in the wall. Along the wall
                    under this opening was placed a high puncheon desk where pupils stood to write.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township, then a part of Ray Township, started its educational history with a log
                    schoolhouse near the mouth of Clear Fork. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fairfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township had a schoolhouse on Templeton's Creek before 1830, and another near
                    Sim's Cemetery across the line in the present Union County at a much earlier date. As this
                    Township was settled in 1804, there were probably very early subscription schools. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Highland</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township had schools at a very early date east of South Gate, on Blue Creek, or perhaps
                    first of all, on Goble's Creek near the southeast corner of Section Sixteen. A map of 1858
                    still locates this one. One of its "graduates", Uncle John Klemme, now
                    ninety-eight years of age "completed" his schooling here in twelve days. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Laurel</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township had a schoolhouse with a dirt floor in 1812 on the present site of the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Laurel</settlement>
                    </placeName>; Meta-mora Township, then a part of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Laurel</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township, one on the "Gordon Farm" built about 1820 or 1825; Posey
                    Township, settled later, had two by 1830, one near Andersonville, and one in the extreme southeast
                    part of the township; Salt Creek Township had its first schoolhouses in the Hawkins neighborhood and
                    in the Stipps Hill vicinity. Ray Township, only thinly settled by the early southern and eastern
                    wave, has left no story of early schools. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township had one on Section 24 by 1814, and Whitewater Township started with one at New
                    Trenton, and soon after added one on Elkhorn Creek. Uncle Ab Case, who died at the age of nearly one
                    hundred some years ago, told the writer that once while the first New Trenton schoolhouse was being
                    repaired, the pupils met and recited in the hollow trunk of a gigantic sycamore tree which lay near
                    the little log school building. The town of <pb n="222" id="VAA4025-026-3-046"/>
                    <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> opened its first school in the old log courthouse in 1816, and subscription schools,
                    now here, now there, usually in abandoned houses about town, were conducted from then on. Later the
                    town built a small brick school where the warehouse of Charles Masters now stands.</p>
            <p>In January, 1827, the Legislature passed an act to establish County Seminaries in several counties,
                    including <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The Circuit Court selected a board of three in 1828, and the new Seminary was ready

                    doors. Its equipment was meanwhile at the mercy of idle boys and tramps. The <hi rend="i">American</hi> of Sept. 1, 1848, charged that the Seminary had been almost ruined by politics,
                    asserting that the Democrats of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> had used it to further partisan purposes only. The truth seems to be that the great
                    democratic movement was toward free public schools and away from the mock-aristocratic type which
                    the Seminary exemplified. Every period of depression was followed by another revival. Feeling
                    evidently that the curriculum needed bolstering, Prof. James Elliot advertised sessions of fourteen
                    weeks in August, 1848, with Plane Trigonometry, Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, Astronomy, Latin,
                    Greek and French, besides the usual subjects, all of which one could carry for $5.00 a
                    term. O. F. Fitch was principal the next year. Meanwhile a Seminary had been opened at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Peoria</settlement>
                    </placeName> near the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Carmel</settlement>
                    </placeName> planned a seminary in 1849, but wisely changed it to a graded district school soon,
                    which became one of the best in the County.</p>
            <p>To get a definite picture of the Seminary, the term of 1845-1846 may be used. I. R. Goodwin was then
                    principal and Mary A. Brown assistant. If there were other teachers their names do not appear. The
                    term began on October 8, 1845. The enrollment, about equally divided between "male and
                    female", was about one hundred twenty for the term, but never more than sixty at one time.
                    The most surprising, almost unbelievable, thing is that the ages varied from four and five to
                    twenty-three. The school evidently was a kindergarten, elementary school, and high school combined
                    sailing under the name of "Seminary". Here was a chance at a liberal education all
                    in one building, with "The cat caught a rat" on the lowest step, and Greek, Latin
                    and Surveying on the highest. The term ended on July 20th.</p>
            <p>The Seminary maintained a struggling existence until the Constitution of 1851 provided for the sale
                    of Seminaries. Other principals, not mentioned above were, according to <pb n="224" id="VAA4025-026-3-048"/> Goodwin, Rev. Isaac A. Ogden, James B. Haile and George B. Chase. The
                    Seminary, in fact, did great and useful work during this chaotic, formative period. Toward the last
                    it aimed somewhat at the preparation of teachers for the district schools, a task it should have
                    taken up much earlier. Many teachers of the fifties and sixties "got their start"
                    at the Seminary. The old building still stands in the <geogName>Whitewater Valley</geogName>, a
                    plain two-story structure hardly more imposing than many little two-room school buildings of today
                    in the poorer rural districts.</p>
            <p>In another place it has been stated that the early judges appointed overseers or superintendents to
                    have charge of district schools. This is according to Goodwin's notes. By 1834, there were
                    both trustees of school districts and school commissioners. One of the latter was Samuel Sering, who
                    held his position for a number of years. The <hi rend="i">American</hi> of March 8, 1835, contained

                    gradually becoming of more importance, but that the trustees were not yet much more important than
                    wolf scalps.</p>
            <p>One of the duties of the school commissioner was the sale of the land in the sections granted for
                    school purposes. The first sale of this kind which has been found was that advertised by Samuel

            <p>The dates of these sales are cited to show that, since the district schools depended mainly for their
                    support on the sales of sixteenth sections, schools prior to 1835, when the sales of school lands
                    began in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName>, must have been maintained by subscription, while the buildings must have been rented
                    or donated by public spirited citizens. A building such as was then used could have been put up by
                    the men of a neighborhood in two or three days at practically no cost, the labor being donated. The
                    legislature of 1837 provided that a school district would receive its pro rata share only if it had
                    a term of three months or more. This was distinctly a forward step.</p>
            <p>The importance of the school trustees and of the commissioner seemed to wane rather than grow. The
                        <hi rend="i">American</hi> of May 31, 1839, points out the fact that the worthy commissioner
                    seemed to have no fixed place of residence. Like General Pope of Civil War fame, his headquarters
                    seem to have been in the saddle. Bitter opposition arose, and the trustees over the County
                    threatened to resign if Mr. Sering did not make Brook-ville or some other centrally located place
                    his home or maintain an office there. On July 22, 1842, the <hi rend="i">American</hi> declared:
                    "There is to be a school commissioner elected at the approaching August election. We have
                    heard of no candidate for the office. The office is worth little or nothing, but will do to satisfy
                    little aspirants." William Potts was such an aspirant and was elected. The stipend seems to
                    have been entirely in the form of fees, and very small fees at that. Under such
                    conditions—short terms, poor log buildings, low wages, etc.—one can imagine
                    that the district teachers were not of a very high class.</p>
            <pb n="227" id="VAA4025-026-3-051"/>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">American</hi> of November 30, 1838, asks: "Have the citizens of the Seventh

                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township a runaway negro slave in their employ as preceptor to their
                    children?" No one answered this question in the negative, thus leaving the impression that
                    this may have been the case.</p>
            <p>There is little to be said in favor of the dilapidated log schoolhouses of the day. Their windows
                    were curtainless, their floors of uneven loose puncheons. There were cracks and crevices everywhere;
                    there was no equipment and no course of study. There were, however, two redeeming features: the
                    great open fireplace as part of the structure and ventilating system; and mainly individual
                    instruction as part of the technique. Critics should not be too severe. The churches of the day were
                    of logs also, as were the jails, and even the courthouses. The comparison could be carried further,
                    and the fact stated that nine-tenths of the families lived in homes constructed of logs.</p>
            <p>That the courses of study were not elaborate was only natural. The <placeName>

                    </placeName> settler was much more concerned with split rails for fences, and split clapboards for
                    roofs than with split infinitives. If teachers were poorly prepared for their vocations, so were
                    most lawyers, doctors, and preachers. We must remember that Indiana, so far as the Constitution or
                    the law is concerned, may start a crop of young lawyers each year, with no requirements except a
                    good moral character. Any one could be a doctor in early Indiana, while being moved by the spirit
                    was seemingly the only preparation that many had for the task of preaching in that period.</p>
            <p>In the district schools, there could have been little uniformity of courses nor was there uniformity
                    of textbooks, even in the same school. Mr. Harry Stoops has an assortment of books used in some of
                    the early schools of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township. Included among them is the famous old <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName> Primer in which the bold lion holds the lamb; in which appears "In
                    Adam's fall we sinned all"; and in which "Uriah's beauteous wife
                    made David seek his [not David's, but Uriah's] life". It is a volume of
                    which the page is hardly as large as the palm of a man's hand, and it is about one-half
                    inch thick. It was used as a speller, reader and catechism combined, and is <pb n="228" id="VAA4025-026-3-052"/> a book marked by a decidedly formidable religious undertone. Hardly a
                    Biblical name of prominence is omitted in the speller and most of the selections have to do with sin
                    or death. The edition is that of 1813.</p>
            <p>Webster's Elementary Spelling-book, first printed in 1803 or 1804, is a much more scholarly
                    book. The edition most used in early Indiana was that of 1816. It is a speller, interspersed with
                    stories and fables, like those credited to Aesop. It also contains maxims and sayings of the Poor
                    Richard type. There are also so-called "Useful Lessons" which deal with facts of
                    arithmetic, geography, other sciences, and morals as well. There was a sequel to this book, <hi rend="i">Webster's Speller and Definer</hi>, in reality a small dictionary of 172
                    pages. By 1845, over 400,000 copies of this book had been sold. It cost twenty cents.</p>
            <p>The "Complete Little Arithmetic", for thirty cents, was in much demand. Its purpose
                    is thus stated by the publishers: "Having heard it stated, that many of the children
                    residing in the remote and sparsely settled districts of our country, enjoy but few of the
                    advantages of a common school education, and that Webster's or some other spelling book
                    furnishes, in many instances, the only guide to book knowledge obtained, the idea [was adopted] of
                    [publishing] an Appendage therto in cheap form, to contain the elementary principles of Mental and
                    Practical Arithmetic with plain instructions for those who may be thus situated". Part One
                    of this has mental exercises in the fundamentals of arithmetic and in all the common weights and
                    measures. Part Two has "slate" exercises in the usual processes of arithmetic up
                    to and including the rule of three. The publishers of this mathematical treatise advertised a <hi rend="i">Wouldst Know Thyself</hi>, a physiology, but it is doubtful whether this subject was
                    taught in many rural schools of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName>, before the Civil War.</p>
            <p>Lindley Murray's Grammar and his English Reader were probably used only in Seminaries and by
                    the most advanced students in district schools. The edition of 1831 was one of those formidable
                    readers of the elocution type so much favored in those days. Addison, Dr. Johnson, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Pope and Hume are the stars in its pages, together with Cicero, Plato, the Apostle
                    Paul, Pliny and Virgil. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s "Morning Hymn" and Pope's "Universal
                    Prayer" are among the best <pb n="229" id="VAA4025-026-3-053"/> selections in this book. At
                    first thought, one can hardly see how students in short terms, with poor teachers could read, let
                    alone master such a book. The answer lies in this, that nearly all the time and energy was centered
                    on reading.</p>
            <p>These were not the only texts used. An advertisement in the <placeName>

                    consisting of <hi rend="i">Speller, Juvenile Readers, Arithmetic</hi> and <hi rend="i">Orthoepy</hi>. They were sold by a Mr. Tyner and recommended by the principal of the academy and
                    the board members. The famous McGuffey Readers came later and swept aside all others. William H.
                    McGuffey was a professor at Miami University from 1826 to 1836, and later President of Cincinnati
                    College and <placeName>

            <p>Under the best planned and administered educational systems, maladjustments are certain to occur
                    sometimes, and not all boys and girls were equally touched by the stern, Puritanic course and
                    teaching of early days. Two instances may be cited to show that human nature has carried little in a
                    hundred years. In a copy of Lindley Murray's <hi rend="i">Reader</hi>, beside <placeName>

                    Burnside who lost the ill-fated battle of Fredricksburg.</p>
            <p>We must always remember that the times were primitive and formative. Universities then attempted
                    hardly more than do high schools now. By November 14, 1834, ten years after it opened, Miami
                    University had two hundred ten students, eight from Indiana. One thousand volumes consituted the
                    library and a total income of $5,000 was available to pay fourteen professors. The
                    Governor of <placeName>
                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName> then received the magnificent sum of $500 as an annual salary, and our own
                    Governor $1,000 with a per diem of $2.00 for traveling expenses. When we
                    remember that tavern rates were fixed by courts or law, and in spite of it were very low, that
                    "drinks" were given away on the "help yourself plan" by every
                    prosperous grocery, that it was easy to avoid paying bills or taxes, we can see that the cost of
                    living was low.</p>
            <p>There was never a lack of candidates for even the most insignificant office. It was a common
                    occurrence to have six to eight candidates for the office of representative from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName> in the State legislature with similar numbers seeking like honors in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName> and other counties. There was plenty of ambition and in many instances the best men
                    seem to have been chosen.</p>
            <p>The census of 1840 shows that the Indiana system had produced some results. The following figures on

                        <country reg="kyu">Kentucky</country>
                    </placeName>-Carolina waves of settlers had followed the <geogName>Whitewater River</geogName> and
                    its main tributaries, and had taken only part of the clay, oak and hickory uplands of
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Highland</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
               </placeName>, Ray and Salt Creek Townships. Into these gaps swarmed Germans
                    of many types, Hessians, Bavarians and others. These had not been partly assimilated to American
                    life as had the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> Dutch. They began to introduce a new system of locating school houses, the dorf or
                    village system. In their church communities, usually near the church, they started schools,
                    parochial or semi-parochial as the case might demand. They introduced better church buildings and
                    better school buildings also. Frequently stone or brick was the material used for their farm houses.</p>
            <p>The founding of the dorf system and the semi-independent church schools in the southwestern part of
                    the County was encouraged by the topography of the Country. The <geogName>Whitewater
                    river</geogName> was almost an impassible barrier a great part of the year. Even as late as 1849,
                    the <hi rend="i">American</hi> in speaking of the first cholera epidemic said: "There have
                    been many deaths across the Rhine [Whitewater] but we have little communications with that
                    region."</p>
            <p>In the late thirties or forties, the School Townships were made to coincide with Civil Townships, and
                    the real era of building public schoolhouses began. The exact date for this cannot be given, but, in
                    Ray Township, it was in 1846 or possibly 1848. This has been called the "stone
                    age" because of the little square stone buildings then erected in most of the southern and
                    western parts of the County. Elsewhere in the County, the new structures were of brick or frame.</p>
            <p>The checker-board plan of placing school houses is here exemplified. Whether those who planned them
                    thought that human beings would forever remain evenly distributed over a territory, or whether they
                    wished to follow Whittier's dictum, "A school house plant on every hill",
                    or Horace Mann's, "The public school houses are the Republic's most
                    important line of fortifications", is not known. The "forts" were built
                    at intervals of two miles. The County map of 1858 shows that the <pb n="232" id="VAA4025-026-3-056"/> "checker board system" was well under way; by 1865 it was as nearly complete as

                    number of people reported in any census was 20,223 in 1870. The population had decreased to 14,806
                    in 1920.</p>
            <p>The dorf or village plan soon came into conflict with the checker board system. Evidently considering
                    what had been done before their arrival as "mere scraps of paper", the Teutons
                    immediately built village or parish schools and asked their church members to send their children to
                    these schools. Schools with two and three rooms thus appeared. School No. 1 in <placeName>

                    </placeName> Township was removed to South Gate, St. Peters became No. 3, Oldenburg absorbed much

                        <settlement type="city">Huntersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> immediately established dorf schools. Other towns, not parish centers, saw the
                    advantages and adopted the system. <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and New Trenton became village school centers. If this system could have been followed
                    through without regard to township lines, it would have been an ideal one. Consolidation by
                    townships came later, and the emphasis was again placed on the township.</p>
            <p>The system for measuring the intellectual achievements of teachers in vogue in early days is only
                    conjectural. Were the commissioners or trustees also examiners? Feb. 19, 1841, the Judges of the
                    Circuit Court appointed Moses J. Kelly, A. S. Babbott and John Wynn examiners. Nothing is given
                    about their qualifications or special fitness, or in regard to salary. Tradition tells us that
                    examinations were very informal. General appearance and personality as seen by the examiner counted
                    for more than "book larnin". One hopeful applicant, after being eyed for a time
                    like a horse for sale, was asked, "What would you do if the itch broke out in your
                    school?" He answered, "Use sulphur and molasses." He was passed. Another
                    applicant asked by an acquaiitance how he could manage to pass any examination shrewdly displayed a
                    five-dollar <pb n="233" id="VAA4025-026-3-057"/> bill. Probably all of the examinations were oral
                    and depended entirely on the character of the examiners.</p>

                    The strongly "religious" townships voted against free schools, those not organized
                    as parishes for them. The same influences were apparent all over the State. Counties having colleges
                    voted decidedly against free schools—<placeName>

            <p>On January 17, 1849, the Assembly passed a common school law. It proposed to increase the common
                    school fund by levying a tax of ten cents per hundred on property and a twenty-five cent poll tax.
                    It also taxed premiums of foreign insurance companies. Proceeds of these taxes, together with the
                    saline and surplus revenue funds and a bank tax were to form a county common school fund. The county
                    treasurer was placed in charge of the fund and made receiver of all money for school purposes. The
                    office of school commissioner was abolished, his duties being transferred to the county auditors and
                    treasurers. The law established a minimum term <pb n="234" id="VAA4025-026-3-058"/> of three months
                    and the township trustee was to arrange schools of equal terms in his districts. The townships were
                    divided into districts with district trustees elected by the voters on the first Monday in
                    September. The district trustee had practically complete charge of buildings, repairs, etc. He
                    reported to the board of township trustees, enumerated the pupils and reported enrollments.
                    Districts were arranged with regard to convenience of patrons. Voters of a district might vote money
                    and labor to build school houses up to fifteen cents per hundred dollars. Township trustees were
                    allowed seventy-five cents per day to be paid by the auditor from township funds, and they employed
                    the district trustees, who were paid from district money. The Treasurer of the State was also State
                    Superintendent. Finally, the law provided for an election in August, 1849, in which each county
                    should accept or reject the new plan.</p>

                    trustee. The <hi rend="i">American</hi> took a progressive attitude, condemned Seminaries and
                    private schools and called all to rally to the new system. A Mr. Ryman was elected. The town and
                    community then had about 400 children of school age. In spite of the <hi rend="i">American</hi>,
                    George Bent undertook to continue the Seminary. <placeName>

            <p>On Monday, September 30, 1849, the first free school opened in <placeName>

                    </placeName> for pupils from five to twenty-one years of age. W. G. Terrell, the principal, taught
                    in the district schoolhouse and O. F. Fitch, his assistant, in the basement of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> Methodist Church. These were the only teachers. The great
                    "Jacksonian" wave of democracy had at last triumphed in a free public school
                    system. The new constitution of 1850-1851 was a great triumph of the democratic wave, though a delay
                    of several years followed an adverse court decision.</p>
            <p>This sketch will close with the forties—those wild, exciting, troublesome times. The
                    Mexican War, the terrific attack of cholera and the gold fever tended to keep the public mind on
                    matters other than educational. The cholera, especially, <pb n="235" id="VAA4025-026-3-059"/> left
                    its marks in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Franklin County</region>
                    </placeName> where hundreds died. Many others moved to newer areas. Some joined the <placeName>

                    </placeName> gold-seekers.</p>
            <p>The decade from 1840 to 1850 was a transitional period in educational ideals. The religious, general
                    culture idea was being attacked. In June, 1849, Rev. Thomas H. Stockton was offered the presidency
                    of Miami University. He declined, declaring the school out of date, with a worn out system. <hi rend="i">The American</hi> added: "Let professors and teachers depend on public
                    patronage and labor to make the school meet the wants and wishes of the age in which we
                    live." Miami University was described as "overendowed". Miami had indeed
                    dropped low in attendance. The 1849-50 enrollment consisted of seven Seniors, eight Juniors,
                    thirteen Sophomores, sixteen Freshmen, thirty-six in Preparatory, and eleven in Partial Courses, a
                    total of 91. <placeName>

            <p>There were two rather common types of teachers, of whom John Robeson and Dr. Thomas were outstanding
                    examples. Robeson well represented the old <placeName>
                        <country reg="scu">South Carolina</country>
                    </placeName>-Indiana type. A versatile man was he, good at log rollings, barn raisings, fox and wolf
                    hunts and famous at dances and merrymakings. Few there were in a wide community who had never heard
                    his merry violin; few bullies for miles around who had never felt the weight of his hard-hitting
                    fists. In the school room, he was condescending to the small and puny but severe with the large and
                    rebellious. In great demand was John, so much so, that some districts preferred to wait for him,
                    permitting him to finish a three months' term elsewhere before their own started.</p>
            <p>Robeson was also an orator and politician. When the Civil War came and he failed to get a commission,
                    he volunteered as a private. As a child, the writer heard of the heroic exploits of John as hunter,
                    fighter and teacher. A Mr. Hahn, an old Civil War veteran who had served side by side with John for
                    years, when asked about John's heroism, hesitated a moment and then said: "He
                    could lick any man—any two men—in his company but when it came to the
                    enemy—well, he wasn't any more than any one of the rest of us."</p>
            <p>An example of the dorf type of teacher was Dr. Thomas. A student at some <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, during the stormy forties, <pb n="236" id="VAA4025-026-3-060"/> an
                    ungrateful country kicked him out for his too loud demands for "gleichheit und
                    freiheit," that is, equality and liberty. Dr. Thomas was a physician, a minister, and also
                    a teacher. He brought his love of liberty with him to America and also his liking for beer. School
                    or church over for the day, he lined up at the village inn and held his own with the best of them.
                    He was eloquent, jovial, energetic, with something of the spirit of Carl Schurz. His regular term of
                    school over, he took subscription pupils, teaching English in the forenoon and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the afternoon. Pupils came for miles to attend his schools. Like great certain
                    teachers of today there was an element of uncertainty about his meting his classes—he
                    might be called away to a sick-bed, or to preach a funeral sermon, or, as sometimes happened, be

            <p>American penetration of the old Northwest began, systematically, in 1778, when Fort Pitt was the
                    western outpost. In that year, a fort was erected on a bluff at the junction of the
                    <geogName>Ohio</geogName> and <geogName>Beaver rivers</geogName>, twenty-eight miles northwest of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which was named Fort McIntosh in honor of General Lachlan McIntosh,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> who was born near Inverness, <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>, in 1725. In 1736 his father joined General Oglethorpe's expedition to <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, with a company of about 100 Highlanders who settled on the <geogName>Altamaha
                    River</geogName> in what is now McIntosh County, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>. In a collision with Spanish forces, McIntosh was taken prisoner, carried away to <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> and returned after several years imprisonment.</p>
            <p>After reaching home, he secured employment with Henry Laurens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                    </placeName> and afterward took up surveying. At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, he raised a
                    regiment and was appointed a brigadier general. His success excited the jealously of Governor
                    Gwinett and after Gwinett's term as governor expired he challenged McIntosh to fight a
                    duel. Both were wounded and Gwinett soon died of his wound. General Washington engaged McIntosh to
                    undertake the defense of western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> against Indian attacks. In this he was successful. In 1778 McIntosh was to take part in
                    a general movement for the capture of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> but was ordered to cooperate with Count d'Estaing in an attack upon Savannah
                    and never returned to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. Fort McIntosh was named in recognition of his services and for a time it was the oniy
                    outpost west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and gave to Fort Sackville the name Patrick Henry. In 1788 settlements and forts were

            <p>The conquest accomplished by General George Rogers Clark was not really a national but a provincial
                    enterprise, for in 1779 the colonies were still engaged in the struggle for independence. <placeName>

                    known tracts.</p>
            <p>During the period of the Revolution, officers and their commands were shifted about frequently, as
                    necessity required, from <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>

                    </placeName> to the southern colonies. Considering the general lack of roads and communications,
                    such movements seem almost incredible today. Because of this movement from north to south and from
                    the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> to the seaboard the movements of troops are hard to follow.</p>
            <p>Among the minor officers of the Revolution was one obscure soldier, who served in many localities and
                    several different regiments. In spite of that and other handicaps, he earned distinction and
                    promotion, rising in time to the rank of Colonel in the First U.S. Infantry Regiment.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> That soldier was John Francis Hamtramck, a native of Quebec, whose infancy and youth
                    were spent under the flag of Great Britain. His father, Charles David Hamtramck, was a native of the
                    Duchy of Luxemburg who settled in Quebec in 1754, conducted a barber shop, made wigs, and married
                    Marie Anne Bertin, a French girl of the town. On August 16, 1756, Jean Francois Hamtramck was
                        born.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> His name was afterwards anglicised, becoming John Francis. His mother
                    was never reconciled to the British conquest of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and it is supposed that she instilled into the boy a prejudice against the conquering

            <p>Just when he was shifted to Western Pennsylvania is not known, but he was stationed at Fort Pitt by
                    the year 1786. In July, Colonel Josiah Harmar sent him with three companies to protect a party of
                    surveyors who were working near the <geogName>Little Beaver River</geogName> in the Mingo Bottom. He
                    was also ordered to destroy the dwellings of intruders on the public lands.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> In
                    both tasks he was successful. He destroyed twelve cabins of "these fellows who wish to live
                    under no government…."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> It was at this time that Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Steuben</settlement>

                    soldiers were "barefoot and miserably off for clothing, particularly woolen

                    Hamtramck, with a party of one hundred men, was detached to conduct the fleet "to the mouth

                    overland. When he arrived he found "the <geogName>Wabash River</geogName> so low and
                    difficult to ascend, [that] I detached a sergeant and twenty men, in three barges and five
                    pettiaugers, to meet Major Hamtramck and lighten the fleet." Hamtramck, however,

                    regulations for them to go by. "My code of laws," he told Harmar, "will,
                    no doubt, make you laugh, but I hope you will consider that I am neither a lawyer or a

                                    January 23, 1790, and if I have not communicated my sentiments before, it was from
                                    an apprehension that they might be contrary to the general opinion of Indian
                                    affairs. They are now presented to your Excellency with full expectation that it
                                    will not be ascribed to arrogance or ostentation on my part, it being the result of
                                    the purest intention. On those calculated expectations I will speak freely, and give
                                    as my opinion that nothing can establish a peace with the Indians as long as the
                                    British keep possession of the upper forts; for they certainly are daily sowing the
                                    seed of discord betwixt the measures of our Government and the Indians.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the Indians will call for a peace early this spring. if so, I can assure you
                                    that I am not mistaken if I prognosticate that it will be done to deceive us, and
                                    ought not to be granted before we have another expedition, and have established
                                    respectable garrisons in the most important parts of their country; then will we be
                                    able to make peace on our conditions, and not on theirs.</p>
                        <p>The Indians never can be subdued by just going into their towns and burning their
                                    houses and corn, and returning the next day, for it is no hardship to an Indian to
                                    live without; they make themselves perfectly comfortable on meat alone; and as for
                                    houses, they can build them with as much facility as a bird does his nest.</p>
                        <p>As for obtaining any advantage of them in action, there is, in my opinion, very
                                    little to be calculated on that head; for they will not fight without having a
                                    decided advantage over their enemies, and if they find they can not meet them, they
                                    always have a sufficient country, which affords them a secured situation.</p>
                        <p>Should Government be disposed to carry on an expedition in the spring without
                                    establishing garrisons in their country, I would then beg permission to suggest an
                                    idea, which can be done by having all the men mounted on good horses, and every man
                                    to be his own commissary; that is, he should furnish himself with provisions for so
                                    many days; by that means a large body of troops would be able to perform (with
                                    probability) such an expedition undiscovered, and with very great dispatch. This
                                    plan appears to me to be the most eligible one that can be adopted; for if the <placeName>
                                        <country reg="xxu">United States</country>
                                    </placeName> want to chastise the Indians, there is no other way to do it with
                                    success than by surprising them in their town or camp. Another observation which I
                                    beg to make, that, admitting a treaty should take place this spring, the people of
                                    our frontier will certainly be the first to break it. The people of <placeName>
                                        <country reg="kyu">Kentucky</country>
                                    </placeName> will carry on private expeditions against the Indians and kill them
                                    whenever they meet them, and I do not believe that there is a jury in all <placeName>
                                        <country reg="kyu">Kentucky</country>
                                    </placeName> who would punish a man for it. These combined circumstances, sir, make
                                    me think that, until we are securely intrenched in the Indian country, we never can
                                    be sure that peace is fully established; for as the thirst of war is the dearest
                                    inheritance an Indian receives from his parents, and vengeance that of the
                                    Kentuckians, hostility must then be the result on both sides.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

            <p>General St. Clair, himself, the following autumn, decided to undertake the chastisement of the
                    Indians. Among others, Major Hamtramck, still stationed at Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName>, was ordered to Fort <placeName>

                    Major Hamtramck and the First Regiment were not participants in the battle, if such it may be
                    called.</p>
            <p>On the morning of October 31, 1791, three days before the army met the Indians, about sixty <placeName>
                        <country reg="kyu">Kentucky</country>
                    </placeName> militia deserted in a body. St. Clair feared that they would seize the provision train
                    which he supposed to be within twenty miles. His men had already been on half allowance of flour
                    with the difference made up in beef for two or three days so that he could not well afford to lose
                    the expected supplies. Accordingly, Major Hamtramck and the First Regiment, consisting of about
                    three hundred effective men, were sent back to protect the convoys. He was told to send a guard back
                    with the first section of the provision train and then to proceed about twenty-five miles below Fort
                    Jefferson, or until he met the second section, and then to rejoin the army.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the attack occurred on October 3, Hamtramck was thirty miles away on his way back to the army.
                    He had not seen the second convoy. Hearing the cannon, he hastened forward. When the regiment had
                    gone about nine miles, they were told by some fleeing militia that the army was totally destroyed.
                    Hamtramck decided that he should do all he could to save the fort if such were the case.
                    Consequently, he sent a subaltern to get more definite information from St. Clair, and he and his
                    men marched back eight miles to Fort Jefferson. He looked to the defenses as best he could and in
                    the evening was preparing to march to meet the retreating army when St. Clair and his sorry band
                    arrived.</p>

                    decision to save Fort Jefferson on the day of the battle. Governor St. Clair wanted to send

                    to try a man when the prosecutor was absent, but St. Clair decided that the circumstances were too

                    with the sound of the blows of the axes and of the falling trees. An Indian brave created a little
                    excitement the first day. One of the privates describes the incident: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It was on the morning of the first day we were at work felling the timber. A squad near where
                            I was at work were engaged in felling a very large and very tall oak standing near the outer
                            edge of the opening, which had been cut nearly through and tottering in mid-air, when a
                            voice was heard overhead which somewhat startled the men at first; but on looking up, they
                            beheld a ‘red varmint’ perched in the topmost branches. This fellow,
                            no doubt, after finding he was caught, had made up his mind that it was death anyway, and
                            concluded to take his chances and go with the tree. But as it began to tremble and shake, he
                            got shaky himself, and, like Captain Scott's 'coon, had to come down and
                            that in a hurry. The boys, as they watched him scramble down, ached to get a shot at him,
                            but they dared not. He was a large, fine-looking Indian. In the belt around his naked waist
                            was a knife and a tomahawk. He appeared perfectly undaunted; in fact, assumed an air of
                            defiance, and when marched off to headquarters, seemed well pleased that he had escaped
                            being killed by the falling tree or the bullets of the soldiers. He was evidently a spy and
                            had climbed to the top of the tree to see what was going on in camp, little dreaming that
                            his adventure would result as it did. When the tree fell, a buckskin pouch was found filled
                            with parched corn and jerked venison. He was held a prisoner for some weeks, and one morning
                            it was announced that he was <hi rend="i">non est</hi>. How he escaped was a mystery that

                    in the American army. The leopards did not change their spots and the thieves continued their
                    depredations in camp, raiding the stores of food and whisky at night and stealing from officers and
                    men alike. They killed cattle, sheep, and pigs of the French settlers, raided the houses of such
                    settlers and were the cause of constant trouble. Several who were detected in such crimes were given
                    one hundred lashes, which was the limit allowed by army regulations. One was hanged and another shot
                    to death. The garrison of the new fort gave Hamtramck much trouble. The thieving and marauding
                    continued. At last in his letters to General Wayne, Hamtramck suggested that he be given a wider
                    discretion and authority which would enable him to hang enough of the malefactors to compel them to
                    respect military orders and regulations. "I have flogged them till I am tired," he
                    wrote. "The economical allowance of one hundred lashes, allowed by the government, does not
                    appear a sufficient inducement for a rascal to act the part of an honest man." In a later
                    letter, he said, <quote rend="blockquote">

                    suggest an indirect method. The French traders seemed to him to be "so many machines to the
                    British agents". Why not bribe them (he thought this entirely possible) and thus deprive
                    the British agent of his "satellites" and leave him "to make penance for
                    his past iniquities".<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

            <p>During the second winter, 1795-96, about ninetey Indians, children, old women, and a few very old
                    men, depended upon the garrison for food. In January Hamtramck's diminishing supplies
                    forced him to tell them that they could get no more food from the fort. "But,
                    sir," he wrote to General Wayne, "if other supplies could be got by land, I
                    consider it politic to feed these poor creatures, who will suffer very much for want of
                    subsistence." In spite of his decision to give them no more, he found it impossible to turn
                    them away when they asked for food. He could not refuse them and see them die.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

                    on July 7, 1838. Alban C. Davis and David Lyons were evidently the leaders in the movement since the
                    latter became the president of the meeting and the former the secretary. The second meeting was held
                    on July 21 of the same year. At this time definite mention was made of the fact that the church was
                    to be free for all denominations of Christians and that it should ever remain so.</p>
            <p>No other documentary material is available for the remaining months of 1838, but a notice of election
                    and a certificate of election indicate the first activities of 1839. At this election Isaac M.
                    Dawson, Alban C. Davis, Frederick Markle, and Marvin M. Hickcox were chosen trustees. On the 29th of
                        <pb n="254" id="VAA4025-026-3-078"/> July, 1839, a deed for the land on which the church now
                    stands was given to the trustees by William and Elizabeth Ann Stevens, husband and wife. The
                    trustees received the property as the representatives of the Union Religious Society of Otter Creek
                    which was the name adopted by the organization fostering the movement. The only qualification was
                    that the property must be used for church purposes.</p>
            <p>The subscription list bears no date but it can be assumed that solicitation for the expense of
                    building the church began soon after the property came into the hands of the Society. The larger
                    number of the approximately seventy persons who pledged money paid in full. Some, however, are
                    marked as not paid, and others seem to have paid only after a judgment was secured against them. A
                    few paid only parts of their subscriptions. The smallest amount pledged was two dollars and the
                    largest one hundred dollars. The average amount was about five dollars although there were several
                    donations of ten and twenty dollars each. These pioneers must have felt the need of a church else
                    they would not have made such pledges in a period when such amounts of money loomed large. Of the
                    $707.50 which was pledged for the construction of the building, $525.50 was
                    finally paid. Frederick Markle and A.M. Pettengill collected the greater part of the building fund,
                    the former obtaining $157.50 and the latter $368.</p>
            <p>Evidence as to the exact date of the completion of the church is lacking. However, in January, 1842,
                    rules were adopted by the trustees for the use of the building. Originally the building was in the
                    form of a rectangle with one large room. The outside has a series of bas-relief pillars. A small
                    rostrum or pulpit was placed in the original building, this being later enlarged into a rostrum
                    extecding across the entire front or west end of the building. The original seats were crude benches
                    which were later replaced with chairs.</p>
            <p>Old Union Church was used for many years as a place for the holding of interdenominational chweh and
                    Sunday school services. The <geogName>Rose Hill</geogName> Methodist Episcopal Church, now located
                    in its own building near Otter Creek Junction in the center of the township came into existence at
                    Old Union. The present Methodist congregation of North <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> whose place of worship is known as the Park Avenue Church, also had its beginnings
                    here. The North <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> Christian <pb n="255" id="VAA4025-026-3-079"/> (Disciples) Church was another
                    congregation which organized in the historic Union building. In addition to these, many series of
                    revival meetings and various attempts to introduce new denominations into the community have been
                    made at Old Union.</p>
            <p>By 1910 the Church was no longer in regular use by any church organization or other society. No one
                    had any responsibility for the care of it. As a consequence, the building was rapidly falling into
                    decay and ruin. The "Inasmuch Circle" of "The King's Daughters
                    and Sons," which had been organized in the church and which had always taken an interest in
                    it was considered by some persons in the community as the logical organization to assume the
                    responsibility for preserving the building. This organization is of an inter-denominational, though
                    religious character, a unit of an international organization. It most nearly corresponded in spirit
                    to the Union Religious Society which built the church.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fred Beal, at the time the judge of the Vigo Superior Court, became interested in the matter. He
                    effected a temporary reorganization of the Union Religious Society, which organization then deeded
                    the property to the Inasmuch Circle. This transaction took place in 1914 and since that time the
                    Circle has kept the church in good repair. Recently, it has been remodeled so as to provide a first
                    unit of a Home for Aged Couples. However, an auditorium has been provided in the remodeled structure
                    which is still used as a community meeting place. Eventually, it is hoped to arrange a small
                    historical museum in the building where objects of interest in the history of the township may be
                    preserved. The exterior of the building remains practically unchanged.</p>
            <p>The documents which follow were turned over to the mother of the writer who is a member of the
                    Inasmuch Circle by Mrs. Anna Markle, wife of one of the descendants of Frederick Markle, a leader in
                    the Union Religious Society. The papers are in a good state of preservation and legible. As can be
                    noted from the documents themselves rules of capitalization, spelling, and punctuation were not
                    closely followed by the writers. Neverthless, the sense is plain in most cases. These papers will be
                    preservcd in the historical museum which it is planned to place in the Old Union Church at as early
                    a time as possible.</p>

            <p>Benjamin Franklin, a wise man of his day and generation, included the following in a draft for a
                    constitution which he submitted to the Second Continental Congress on July 21, 1775: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>As all new Institutions may have imperfections which only Time and Experience can discover,
                            it is agreed, that the General Congress from time to time shall propose such Amendments of
                            this Constitution as may be found necessary; which being approv'd by a Majority of
                            the Colony Assemblies shall be equally binding with the rest of the Articles of this
                            Confederation.</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>This very simple method of changing the fundamental law was not embodied in the Articles of
                    Confederation nor in the Constitution framed in 1787. Members of State constitutional conventions,
                    if we may judge by amending clauses in State constitutions, have usually believed that political
                    wisdom would die with them. No part of a constitution can be a greater barrier to orderly progress
                    than a rigid and unworkable amending provision. The general assumption has been that constitutions
                    would undergo constant modifications should the amending process be made easy. The fundamental truth
                    is that the danger lies in the opposite direction. Even with a liberal amending clause, essential
                    changes would in most instances be delayed too long. The members of the Indiana Constitutional
                    Convention of 1850-1851 reached the climax of conservatism when framing the amending clause. The
                    provision then agreed on, which makes an eloquent though mute plea for a new constitutional
                    convention reads: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Any amendment or amendments to this Constitution may be proposed in either branch of the
                            General Assembly; and if the same be agreed to by a majority of the members elected to each
                            of the two Houses, such proposed amendment or amendments shall, with the years and nays
                            thereon be entered on their journals and referred to the General Assembly to be chosen at
                            the next general election; and, if in the General Assembly so next chosen, such proposed
                            amendment or amendments shall be agreed to by a majority of all the members elected to each
                            house, then it shall be the duty of the General Assembly to submit such amendment or
                            amendments to the electors of the State and if a majority of said <pb n="265" id="VAA4025-026-3-089"/> electors shall ratify the same, such amendment or amendments
                            shall become a part of this Constitution.</p>

            <p>A very timely book, <hi rend="i">Constitution Making in Indiana</hi>, III, by Charles Kettleborough,
                    Director of the Indiana Legislative Bureau, was recently brought out by the Indiana Historical
                    Bureau. This volume, which follows two others published in 1916, covers the efforts that have been
                    made by citizens of Indiana since that date to replace the present Constitution (framed near the end
                    of the stage-coach era) with a new one. A review of Dr. Kettleborough's welcome
                    contribution will appear in our December issue.</p>

                        <p>The article by Miss Knox which was published in the December, 1929, issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, awakened in my memory thoughts of the
                                    dear little City of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                                    </placeName> that have slept for almost 50 years, during my residences and
                                    wanderings over various parts of the world. About fifty years ago, when I had
                                    practised law at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, Indiana for but two years, the trusting and confiding people of the
                                    Judiciary Circuit, composed of Jefferson and <placeName>
                                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland Counties</country>
                                    </placeName>, took a desperate chance in electing me Prosecuting Attorney. As I look
                                    back upon that it seems the more strange when I realize that I defeated for the
                                    nomination two middle aged men, one of whom was holding his first term as
                                    Prosecutor. My official duties required me to visit <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                                    </placeName> twice every year, to attend the regular term of court, and prosecute
                                    pleas of State. At the end of my first term I was reelected, and in the course of
                                    the four years that I held that office many interesting cases were tried at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, some of which awakened an interest in the entire county and caused
                                    neighborhoods to become partison. I recall one—the prosecution of the
                                    editor of one of the papers at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                                    </placeName> (I cannot now remember its name) for publishing what was alleged to be
                                    a libel upon the County Superintendent of Schools. The paper was a Democratic paper
                                    and the Superintendent was a Republican, and the people of the County became
                                    partisans pretty much as their political predilections influenced them. Another
                                    celebrated case of that time was the prosecution of a man by the name of Munson for
                                    forgery. Munson was a lightning rod agent and his family, if I remember correctly,
                                    were active Methodists at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. After his conviction I was besieged, as were all the County Officers,
                                    to secure his pardon, and this campaign for pardon lasted a great many months. In
                                    one murder case during my time, the Hon. Daniel W. <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-026-3-090"/> Voorhies, ever one of the greatest of advocates in
                                    homicide cases, was among the attorneys employed by the defense.</p>
                        <p>I was particularly interested in Miss Knox's reference to the hotel kept by
                                    Aunt Julia LeClere, and her reminiscences with reference to the older people. Aunt
                                    Julia's hotel was in many respects extremely excellent, and after having
                                    travelled far and wide I have found few places where better food was served at the
                                    table; but it did not have all the modern conveniences, not even of that day. There
                                    was no clerk and Aunt Julia, being a woman of most exemplary habits, adhered to the
                                    adage of "early to bed and early to rise". She would leave the
                                    front door of the hotel open, and on the counter would be as many candlesticks with
                                    candles in them as there were vacant rooms, and hanging on a keyrack the key to each
                                    room not already occupied. Those of us who came up from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                                    </placeName> left on the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName> packet in the early evening and reached <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                                    </placeName> generally between 11 and 1 o'clock. We would then walk up to
                                    the hotel, take our candle, light it and go up to the vacant room for which we got
                                    the key from the rack. I recall on one occasion having got off the boat with a
                                    gentleman whose acquaintance I had formed during the trip, and who proved to be the
                                    son of the Hon. Jesse D. Bright who had the misfortune to be on the wrong side at
                                    the beginning of the Civil War. When Mr. Bright and I arrived at the
                                    hotel—he was a stranger in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and I had informed him of the way the house was conducted—we
                                    found but one key on the rack and one candle. There being two of us, there was
                                    nothing to do but go up and at least look at the room. We found a comfortable room
                                    with two beds. Mr. Bright was a great talker, and although I needed sleep, as I had
                                    to be in Court the next morning, I got very little that night. While his
                                    conversation was interesting, I would have been glad to have foregone it for the
                                    sleep.</p>
                        <p>Another noteworthy recollection is of one of the floods which so frequently visited
                                    the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> in those times. Judge James Y. Allison was the
                                    Circuit Judge, and he had to attend the Court. I do not remember whether he came up
                                    on a boat, or whether he came in a private conveyance, but when the week's
                                    term of court was over floodtides had so swollen the river that it had overflowed
                                    its banks, and boats could not run, as the paddles made waves that would have caused
                                    great damage. The roads to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                                    </placeName> were also covered by water in many places, and our only way to get
                                    home, apparently, was to go in what we called in that day a skiff or a small yawl.
                                    The Judge and I hired an oarsman with a good stout boat and went down the twenty
                                    miles of a swift current to our homes in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                                    </placeName> at floodtide.</p>
                        <p>For more than four decades I have been away from Indiana and have lived and traveled
                                    in many parts of the world, but it is a pleasure for memory to wander back over the
                                    pleasant years of my younger manhood, and particularly to recall how kind were the

                    writing in Indiana became exempt from the obligation. It is hoped that not one of them will squander

               <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>. We have had a generous response to our appeals for
                    back numbers, especially for those dated later than 1914. We have a serious need for copies of
                    issues from 1905 to 1912. We very much desire to locate the four numbers of volume IV (1908); number
                    one of volume VI (1910); the four numbers of volume VII (1911); the four numbers of vol. VIII
                    (1912). We will buy further copies of the following issues: Dec., 1921; Mar., 1922; double-number
                    June-Sept., 1925.</p>
            <p>Full sets of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> can be supplied to libraries or individuals who may
                    desire to purchase only with great difficulty. A complete file from 1920 forward can be supplied at
                    fifty-cents a copy or two dollars per volume, unbound; from 1914 to 1919, the price is one dollar
                    per copy, or four dollars per volume; a file from 1905-1913, when it can be supplied at all, must be
                    priced at a much higher figure.</p>

            <p>The <hi rend="i">General Index</hi> for volumes I-XXV of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                    History</hi> prepared by Miss Dorothy Riker of the Indiana Historical Bureau is now ready for
                    distribution. Orders received in advance of publication have either been filled or copies will be
                    mailed with this issue of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>. The expense of printing has been quite
                    large and the edition is limited. It is not possible to furnish copies free to libraries or to
                    members of the Indiana Historical Society, but a nominal price of $1.00 only is being
                    charged. Orders will be filled at <pb n="270" id="VAA4025-026-3-094"/> this price until January 1,
                    1931, after which the charge will be $2.00 per copy. The <hi rend="i">Index</hi> will
                    prove very useful to all libraries possessing complete or partial files of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>. It should also prove valuable to individual members of the Indiana Historical
                    Society, and it is hoped that many will order copies before the end of the year.</p>
