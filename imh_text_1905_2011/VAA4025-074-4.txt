            The years from 1848 through 1857 were an era of decision for almost every city of the Middle West.
                    After a decade in which the region's towns had staggered under the impact of financial
                    panic and depression, the later 1840s brought a new set of conditions for growth. The construction
                    of eight thousand miles of railroad altered each city's access to resources and markets.
                    Accelerating migration and the expansion of agricultural production both in older and younger states
                    presented new economic opportunities and forced quick decisions on urban entrepreneurs. The rapid
                    growth of Chicago and St. Louis, the relative lag of Cincinnati, Louisville, and Columbus, and the
                    emergence of Detroit, Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Dayton as major cities were all products of the
                    antebellum decade.1
            
            Certainly these were crucial years in the growth of Indianapolis. Although the $10 million
                    state internal improvements program of the 1830s had triggered a brief boom that raised the
                    city's population to four thousand, financial collapse and the end of payments on the
                    public works in 1839 had blighted the city's hopes and reduced its population to 2,692 by
                    1840. In the early 1840s, Indianapolis was scarcely more than a country town. "Its business
                    was purely local," wrote one native in retrospect. "It produced little, and it
                    distributed little that it did not

                    demand, was even more triffling than the mercantile business."2
            
            The city's career changed dramatically with the completion of the Madison and Indianapolis
                    Railroad in September, 1847. Contemporaries were of one mind that Indianapolis' first
                    railway link to the Ohio River opened a new era of growth by stimulating trade and setting off a
                    local railroad mania.3 In the brief period from 1852 to 1854, seven new
                    railroads connected Indianapolis to other Indiana towns. New manufacturing industries appeared in
                    response, and merchants began to expand their businesses by experimenting with jobbing as well as
                    retailing. By the middle of the decade, the town's population was nearly fifteen thousand,
                    and natives were styling it the "Railroad City."4
            
            The growth of Indianapolis slowed when the panic of 1854 killed several additional railroads and
                    destroyed many of the state's banks. Poor crops made 1855 another bad year, but the city
                    recuperated with a moderate real estate boom in 1856.5 The financial troubles of
                    1857 again damaged new enterprises and threatened serious unemployment, but the ensuing depression
                    was probably less severe than in larger cities.6 Indeed, by

                     1860 Indianapolis was the focal point of Indiana. With
                    railroads that tied together the corners of the state, it was the nerve-center where churchmen
                    argued dogma, reformers planned crusades, and politicians scratched each others' backs.
                    Citizens responded to its importance by claiming a population of twenty thousand, twenty-five
                    thousand, or even twenty-nine thousand at the end of the decade.7 The 18,611
                    inhabitants counted by the census still matched it with Dayton and Columbus as one of the largest
                    inland towns in the West.8
            
            In Indianapolis and in other western cities, the antebellum boom triggered spirited public discussion
                    about the character of the new commercial opportunities, about the economic needs of each city, and
                    about the measures which might satisfy these wants. Newspapers, corporate reports, directories,
                    pamphlets, and orations considered how each town could best exploit its new opportunities. Residents
                    described current activities, advocated new projects, and detailed strategies for growth in a
                    diverse and substantial body of literature which later historians frequently lumped under the term
                    "boosterism." The resulting debate helped business and civic leaders to assess the
                    situation they faced and to define a coherent economic program to be carried out by public and
                    private action.
            Such single-minded attention to the questions of economic growth accompanied by an excited use of the
                    various media of communication was especially characteristic of the antebellum Northwest. Although
                    David R. Goldfield, Arthur H. Shaffer, and Lyle W. Dorsett have recently explored the large body of
                    booster literature produced in the antebellum South and have discovered a strong interest in urban
                    growth, even southerners themselves in the 1840s and 1850s agreed that "the land of
                    advertising" lay north of the Ohio River and complained that the "books,
                    pamphlets, maps, cards and descriptive plates" which publicized every town in the Northwest
                    were seldom

                     imitated in the South9 Daniel Boorstin has
                    identified the fast-growing "upstart cities" of the antebellum West as the natural
                    habitat of the American booster.10 Where publicists in the East might dwell on
                    the history or the cultural refinement of their city and southerners might concern
                    themselves with the political implications of commercial growth, citizens of the antebellum
                    Northwest ignored cultural attainments and social advantages to write about population,
                    money-making, and the volume of trade.11
            
            Boosting one's city in the antebellum Northwest was both a solemn duty and an exercise in
                    creative writing. Westerners delighted in reading bold and bombastic descriptions of their
                    region's future prosperity. Their editorials and pamphlets were frequently romantic,
                    fanciful, and enthusiastic, with more care lavished on the adjectives than the nouns. At the same
                    time, the resulting boosterism was deeply serious, for urbanites took economic development as a
                    moral imperative. Pompous and stiff with the conviction of high purpose, they often wrote sermons of
                    worldly enterprise. "We owe it to the new home we have all of us chosen," wrote
                    the Chicago Journal, "to this land … to our posterity, and to
                    the general good of the human race, that we do not sit idly by and see others grasp the improvements
                    to their benefit, which an advancing age has placed within our reach."12
            
            Given this context for boosterism in the antebellum West, it is important to examine the degree to
                    which it was rooted in local circumstances and had reference to the problems of specific

                     cities. Popular discussion of economic growth in fact balanced
                    between the two poles of vague generality and narrow self-interest. Taking their clue from such
                    satirists as Charles Dickens and Mark Twain, several historians have emphasized the deficiencies of
                    much antebellum boosterism. According to this interpretation, public discourse on urban economic
                    growth usually had the purpose of aiding individual real estate speculations and business
                    enterprises rather than the interests of the larger community. In the words of Daniel Aaron,
                    "what was popularly interpreted as Vision' meant hardly more than faith in
                    Cincinnati real estate."13 At the other extreme, many western boosters
                    thought in terms of an urban manifest destiny and expected to read their city's future
                    directly off a map of North America. Such an orientation made it easy to ignore the specific
                    circumstances of each city in favor of a broad enthusiasm about regional growth.14 William Gilpin and Jesup W. Scott, two writers with elaborately developed theories of
                    western urbanization, found no problem in transferring their predictions of urban greatness from one
                    city to another in rapid succession. If the Valley of the Mississippi was destined to be the final
                    home of empire, it made relatively little difference if its capital was to be Toledo or Chicago,
                    Kansas City or even Denver.15 Businessmen in each city in fact ranged at
                    different points between the two extremes. While some could scarcely see beyond their own bank
                    balance, others recognized that entrepreneurial success in land dealing, banking, commerce, and
                    transportation was closely linked to the growth of the community as a whole. In some cities it is
                    possible to distinguish clear central tendencies—an unwillingness in one town to look
                    beyond individual concerns toward a "combined exertion for the

                     general good," a strong concern with community growth
                    among opinion leaders in another. Key residents in the more successful cities identified their
                    personal future with community growth and believed firmly in the importance of joint action through
                    "the self-imposed labors … of earnest-souled, iron-willed, active-minded
                    citizens." The acceptance of clearly stated ideas about future economic directions made it
                    easier for "community-focused" entrepreneurs to discover financial backing and to
                    rally popular support. The same consensus helped these business and civic leaders to coordinate
                    their use of private corporations, commercial organizations, and governmental bodies in pursuit of
                    economic goals for their city.16
            
            The key in judging the role of boosterism in antebellum urban growth is therefore not the flamboyance
                    of its rhetoric but the scope of its concerns and its accuracy of judgment. Popular discussion of a
                    city's economic future could have positive impact to the degree that it involved the
                    realistic analysis of the particular circumstances of that community. The notoriously highflown
                    prose of Chicago boosters thus did not affect the basic accuracy of their economic analysis or its
                    usefulness as a rallying point for city leaders. In Cincinnati, in Galena, and in St. Louis, in
                    contrast, lack of consensus stemming from wishful rather than hardheaded thinking helped to justify
                    conflicting and wasteful transportation projects and investment schemes.17
            
            Popular economic thought in antebellum Indianapolis as judged within this framework generally
                    involved accurate description of the local situation and well-measured suggestions for future
                    development. The following analysis describes the city's growth process during its first
                    era of rapid development in the late 1840s and 1850s in terms of the entrepreneurial sequence of
                    observation, planning, and implementation of economic ideas. With an approach to urban development

                     residents of Indianapolis shared a realistic interpretation of
                    their city's geographic situation and its chances for growth. In addition, they pursued
                    well-measured economic goals with a unified spirit of public enterprise which helped to reduce
                    internal strife and wasted effort.
            In a region noted for journalists who appointed themselves instant advocates of new communities,
                    Indianapolis produced relatively little boosterism directed at outside investors or emigrants. Many
                    of its newspapers—the American, Republican, Free Democrat, Democrat, and
                        Statesman—dealt largely with issues of politics for a statewide audience. Those
                    newspapers which had greater concern for the particular needs and interests of the
                    city—the later Sentinel, the Journal, the Locomotive, and at the end of
                    the decade the Atlas—directed their economic discussions inward,
                    analyzing the bases of growth and urging local action. Occasional correspondents called for greater
                    efforts to advertise the city, arguing that publication of its advantages would cause capital to
                    flow to the city "as the rivers do to the ocean."18 Most
                    editors, however, remained content that Indianapolis should enjoy a "spontaneous"
                    prosperity rather than a growth "worried out of a victimized Eastern public by systematic
                    advertising and fabulous puffing." Better than such boosterism, they said, was a local and
                    state pride which sought the rapid development of the city by its own efforts.19
            
            In the statistically minded West, the city also lacked local residents who assiduously compiled and
                    published numerical data on its growth. Apart from railroad pamphlets designed explicitly to raise
                    capital, the only such publicity specifically for an outside audience came from the Board of Trade.
                    In 1854, the new organization prepared a circular to show "the advantages Indianapolis
                    possesses as a central business point." After two years of dormancy, the organization
                    revived to issue new pamphlets in 1856 and 1857, the latter accompanied by a great ado of public
                    meetings and newspaper blurbs. The bustling activity was an empty gesture, however, for the Board
                    was unable to raise even $1,000 to defray its expenses and left stacks of pamphlets
                    undistributed. Three years later the Sentinel remarked sourly: "Spasmodically, our people
                    arouse to the importance of this great interest [manufactures] and talk freely

                     of publishing to the world the advantages we possess; but the
                    fever dies out and nothing is accomplished."20
            
            Internal discussion of the city's economic situation, in contrast, was plentiful and
                    consistent. When the men of the Hoosier capital pored over the map of the Union, they again and
                    again remarked their central location. Almost precisely in the middle of Indiana and roughly
                    equidistant from the large cities of the lakes and rivers, Indianapolis was the "great
                    central City of the West."21 Even in the decade after the Civil War,
                    natives continued to believe that its location in the very middle of the Middle West was the
                    "primary influence" on its growth and gave it great advantages over other inland
                        cities.22
            
            Indianapolis writers also recognized the reciprocity between their city's geographic
                    position and its centrality within the western transportation system. In the 1830s, the town had
                    been designated as the "grand centre" of Indiana's ill-fated program of
                    canal and turnpike construction.23 By the 1850s westerners noted that its
                    location was a magnet for railroad lines, whose presence in turn added an extra facet to its
                        centrality.24 Boosters and entrepreneurs habitually referred to the city as
                    the "Union Center of Indiana Railroads" or as the "Great Railroad Center
                    of the West" and formulated a railroad strategy intended to increase the nodality of their
                        city25 The railroads projected to or from the city in the late 1840s and
                    finished between 1852 and 1854 formed a set of rays. Lines

                     were built south to Lawrenceburg, Madison, and Jeffersonville
                    on the Ohio, west and north to Terre Haute, Lafayette, and Peru on the Wabash, and east to connect
                    with Ohio railways. In the middle of the decade Indianapolis entrepreneurs attempted to add missing
                    radials by agitating for lines to Fort Wayne, Evansville, Vincennes, and Decatur, Illinois. A Board
                    of Trade map displaying the various lines built and proposed by 1853 shows clearly that the city
                    regarded itself as "the hub of a wheel—the railroads leading from it forming the
                        spokes."26 The whole system was designed to create a vortex
                    centered on Indianapolis by cutting across east-west and north-south railroads in the lower Middle
                    West and diverting their trade to a single focus.27
            
            There was also a strong belief that the interests of Indianapolis required that it become a point of
                    intersection for major through railroads. Several promoters viewed central Indiana as a narrow
                    isthmus of dry and level land. To the south were hills along the Ohio River, to the north were Lake
                    Erie, Lake Michigan, the Calumet and Kankakee marshes southeast of Chicago, and the Black Swamp
                    southwest of Toledo. East-west railroads, they thought, would of necessity pass through this narrow
                    band of suitable terrain and through its pivotal city like sand through the neck of an hourglass.28 Many entrepreneurs consequently introduced their projects to Indianapolis
                    businessmen as links in the hypothetical "great central Atlantic and Western
                        Railroad."29 Local writers called for the construction through
                    their town of lines connecting the important peripheral cities of the West.
            Indiana businessmen tried several times to promote or put together such a trunk line. In 1847 Marion
                    County interests held a convention to convince outside capitalists that a Cincinnati-St. Louis
                    railroad could most economically make use

                     of the tracks of the planned Terre Haute-Indianapolis-Richmond
                    railroad. The proposal received strong support in Indianapolis and was revived in 1849 when Samuel
                    Merrill, Nicholas McCarty, and several other leading citizens advocated the plan at a railroad
                    convention in Steubenville, Ohio.30 In the early 1850s, the Madison and
                    Indianapolis Railroad aspired to become a major link between the Ohio and the Great Lakes. It
                    provided equipment for the Indianapolis and Bellefontaine Railroad, coordinated its operations with
                    those of the Lafayette and Indianapolis, and for a few months in 1854 entirely absorbed the Peru and
                    Indianapolis Railroad, the merger being dissolved only after suit by stockholders of the latter
                        road.31 John Brough, the enterprising president of the Madison company,
                    moved to Indianapolis and assumed control of the Indianapolis and Bellefontaine Railroad in 1853. In
                    the next few years he consolidated that line with the Bellefontaine and Indianapolis in Ohio, gained
                    control of the line to Terre Haute, and tried to build an extension from Terre Haute to St. Louis.
                    When the Illinois legislature frustrated his efforts, he abandoned Indiana to live in Cleveland and
                    tend his Ohio railroad interests.32 Oliver H. Smith, ousted by Brough as
                    president of the Indianapolis and Bellefontaine, took up a new project in the same years. He
                    consistently described the Evansville, Indianapolis and Cleveland Straight Line Railroad as a great
                    highway between Lake Erie and the Ohio River and as a replacement for the Wabash Canal.33
            
            Belief in the importance of the city's centrality also underlay discussions of the most
                    suitable economic activities. Its position sharply limited its agricultural export business, for
                    example, because central Indiana farmers shipped their grain and pork directly to the Wabash and
                    Ohio rivers en route to

                     southern markets.34 The completion of the
                    Madison Railroad did make the city an assembly point for produce from the region north of the city
                    and allowed the establishment of several commission houses.35 At the most,
                    however, Indianapolis' export trade area extended sixty or seventy miles north and
                    northwest in the early 1850s. One writer in 1846 stated that local merchants expected to control
                    only the area within forty miles, and a later list of twenty-five towns whose flour mills traded
                    through Indianapolis included none more than forty miles away.36 Such a radius
                    of influence would have brought the Indianapolis hinterland roughly to the edge of the area trading
                    through Fort Wayne and Toledo. Maps of the frequency of stagecoach service prepared by Michael
                    Conzen also show a hinterland oriented toward the north. The diversion of business from counties
                    east of the city with the opening of the Indiana Central and Bellefontaine railroads to Ohio was
                    probably balanced by new flows from the area between Indianapolis and the Wabash and brought little
                    basic change in its export trade before the Civil War37
            
            Given the city's limited possibilities for grain and produce trade, Indianapolis newspapers
                    and magazines devoted little time to the analysis of farming in central Indiana or the advocacy of
                    commerce in farm commodities. Many residents in fact complained about the incomplete development of
                    their small agricultural hinterland. They worried about the slow settlement of the Miami Reservation
                    between Noblesville and Peru

                            southward freight amounting to 24,000 barrels of flour and 200,000 bushels of corn, much of
                            it from the new connection at Indianapolis. Exports on the railroad showed an even larger
                            increase with the completion of rail lines north and west of Indianapolis in
                            1851–1852, with flour shipments rising by seventy thousand barrels and grain by
                            close to a million bushels. Madison and Indianapolis Railroad, Eighth Annual

                    Nor did they show jealousy of the agricultural export business transacted by a potential rival such
                    as Lafayette except when its railroad plans interferred with local schemes.39
            
            Indianapolis devoted considerably more attention to the possibilities of supplying merchandise and
                    manufactured goods to Indiana farms and towns over its radial rail system. Newspapers in 1854 and
                    1855 called for the establishment of wholesale houses and in 1857 backed efforts to publicize the
                    city's advantages as a jobbing center.40 Some boosters believed that
                    the "quick, cheap, uninterrupted and abundant communication" offered by its
                    railroads would make Indianapolis a "concentrating wholesale emporium," for the
                    various lines supposedly allowed the supply of "more than two million customers
                    … quicker and as cheaply as from any other point in
                    the country."41
            
            The city's hinterland for imported merchandise was in fact limited by the competition of
                    Cincinnati. Located between eastern suppliers and Indiana buyers, Queen City merchants could control
                    the business of many Indiana retailers almost to the grounds of the statehouse and serve markets
                    along the Wabash by steamboat. The numerous Cincinnati advertisements in Indianapolis newspapers and
                    directories show that its businessmen expected to make large sales within the Hoosier capital
                    itself. Within the commercial sphere of Cincinnati, Indianapolis in the 1850s probably supplied
                    goods to merchants only within a fifty or sixty mile radius.42 Although as many
                    as seventy retailers and forty manufacturers in Indianapolis shared this limited wholesale business
                    by 1856 and 1857 and a

                    "wholesalers," not a single firm devoted exclusively to the jobbing trade survived

            Indianapolis publicists were equally eager to discuss their city's advantages for
                    manufacturing. The completion of the Madison Railroad helped to set off an industrial boom by
                    reducing the cost of coal imports from the Ohio River. Most of the steam-powered factories which
                    developed during the next several years processed local farm products or furnished sawed lumber,
                    furniture, machinery, and agricultural implements to residents of nearby counties.44 Although boosters in 1853 and 1854 pointed with pride to the "wonderful
                    progress" of Indianapolis manufactures, industrial growth slackened in the later 1850s as
                    businessmen failed to raise capital to expand existing plants or to prosecute successfully an
                    ambitious project for a large rolling mill.45
            
            The local response to the diminishing pace of industrial growth was a renewed discussion of the
                    city's need and advantages for manufacturing. Every important newspaper in the later 1850s
                    bristled with statements about the city's want of industry, and the Board of Trade prepared
                    an elaborate circular on "such additional branches of Manufactures as may be profitably and
                    successfully established in this city." As far as editors were concerned, the city had no
                    hope for the future unless it conserved its energy and resources for manufacturing. "The
                    question whether Indianapolis is to continue to increase in population and wealth," said
                    one, "must depend mainly on whether she becomes a manufacturing city."46

            Analyses of local advantages for manufacturing stressed the city's central location and its
                    purportedly unrivalled railroad facilities which were thought to give it entry to extensive
                        markets.47 With connections to all parts of the state, the city was
                    considered an excellent site for producing wagons and farm machinery and for processing farm
                        products.48 Moreover, Indianapolis was not only "the Commercial
                    Metropolis, the largest City and geographical center" of Indiana, but also had easy access
                    to inhabitants of adjoining states. Natives were convinced, in short, that "the admitted
                    principal in political economy, that the producer and consumer should be brought as near together as
                    possible, must act with increasing force for years to come, in building up manufactures here in the
                    very center of the great producing interests of the Northwest."49
            
            Most perceptively, the citizens of Indianapolis in the 1850s argued that its position at the center
                    of the Indiana rail system opened the entire state as a hinterland for service activities and made
                    the city a gateway for westward travel. Because railroads placed it within a half-day journey of
                    eighty of the state's ninety-two counties, Indianapolis was the most appropriate site for
                    conventions, for the state university, or for "any Institution or business that looks to
                    the patronage of the people of the State."50 Newspapers praised the
                    city's hotels, recommended its schools, argued for the removal of the state university to
                    Indianapolis, and supported a campaign to serve as host

                            in fact the Civil War which allowed the expansion of the city's control over
                            Indiana markets. The city's central position made it the assembly point for
                            munitions and soldiers, whose presence at nearby camps increased the demand for imports and
                            local manufactured goods. In the later years of the conflict, large wholesaling houses and
                            factories developed as Indianapolis wrested much of the state's business from

                    reinforced its centrality by making it a major point for the dissemination of political and
                    commercial information through personal contacts and through its newspapers and magazines.52
            
            Service activities had in fact been a vital part of the local economy since the 1830s. In the
                    city's first decade, hotel owners, saloon keepers, and retailers had looked forward to the
                    $30,000 that lobbyists and legislators could be expected to spend during each meeting of
                    the General Assembly and had made all debts payable at the time of the session when hard cash was
                    most plentiful.53 As the state capital and as the site of a federal land office,
                    moreover, Indianapolis was the place where Hoosier lawyers gathered throughout the year to transact
                    their most profitable business and swing their biggest deals. The economic base was further enlarged
                    in the 1840s by the decision to build state schools for the deaf and the blind and a public hospital
                    for the insane. Together, state expenditures for asylums, permanent officers, and public printing
                    amounted to perhaps $200,000 per year in the 1850s.54 Although local
                    spokesmen denied that the city depended on state expenditures when challenged by jealous rivals,
                    they regarded its public institutions with pride and admitted that removal of government offices
                    might ruin many businesses.55
            
            In the same decades, Indianapolis' centrality made it the place "where the
                    delegates of the different benevolent societies converge twice a year, and the Legal, Medical, and
                    Clerical Professions are frequently together in a body."56 In May of
                    1856, for example, the city hosted the Indiana Medical Society and the General Conference of the
                    Methodist Episcopal Church; three years later it held a meeting of the General Association of the
                    old school Presbyterians and a convention of Indiana Episcopalians. The most important among
                    conventions were the

                     fairs held six times before the Civil War by the State Board of
                    Agriculture. About twenty-five thousand sightseers attended each year, crowding the city's
                    trains, packing its fifteen-odd hotels, and spending perhaps $100,000.57 In order to secure the permanent location of the state fair, Indianapolis leaders fought
                    off the claims of rival towns, and its voters approved a public contribution toward the purchase of
                    new fairgrounds by a margin of six to one.58
            
            Related to these government and service activities was Indianapolis' role as a financial
                    center for Indiana. Since the 1830s it had been the headquarters of the State Bank and in 1854 was
                    proposed as the site for a "Union Bank" intended to support the currency of the
                    state's other banks. Most of the state's free banks, which were officially located
                    in other towns, did their business through "agencies" in the capital.59 Several fire insurance companies also transacted a statewide business from
                    Indianapolis, and formal and informal business organizations normally convened there.60
            
            Having marked out a coherent set of goals, entrepreneurs pursued them without fanfare. The
                    city's growth, as a result, came not from a few spectacular enterprises but from the
                    measured operations of numerous small businesses. According to the 1860 federal census, for example,
                    its largest factory employed sixty workers, and its average manufacturing establishment had fewer
                    than ten employees.61 Residents of Indianapolis were justly proud that wealth
                    was distributed relatively evenly among its citizens. In 1850, 37.9 percent of its employed males
                    twenty years or older owned real property. Ten years

                     later the proportion was 35.7 percent. Both figures were
                    significantly above levels in Cincinnati and Chicago and were slightly higher than the 35 percent
                    average which Lee Soltow has calculated for nonfarm workers in the Middle West.62 Of major immigrant groups, only the Irish fell below native Americans in percentage of
                    workers holding property, while the British and Germans matched or exceeded the native American
                        level.63 A successful Indianapolis entrepreneur was Calvin Fletcher, a
                    lawyer and officer of the State Bank revealed by his diary as a man of intense uprightness and
                    enterprise. Having grown up with the city, Fletcher enjoyed close ties with many of its leaders in
                    manufacturing, commerce, and law. Since the core of Indianapolis' financial community was
                    distinguished by stability over time, many of the leaders he had known in the 1830s wielded
                    influence and held positions of trust into the 1850s.64 Others in the group
                    resembled Fletcher in character. Contemporary biographies of Indianapolis entrepreneurs show less
                    admiration for the aggressive go-getter than for the steady citizen who pursued his own business and
                    attended to his duty.65

            Indeed, antebellum Indianapolis possessed only one truly flamboyant entrepreneur. Oliver H. Smith,
                    erstwhile lawyer, Whig politician, and United States Senator, tried to make himself the
                    town's preeminent publicist and promoter in the late 1840s. In speech after speech he
                    boosted railroads, supported the Board of Trade, and found evidence in the city of wonderful growth.
                    His writings were so enthusiastic that they sometimes parodied the booster style. In practice,
                    however, Smith had difficulty in securing loans from the Indianapolis branch of the State Bank,
                    perhaps the city's central economic institution. The chief fruit of his energetic
                    promotional efforts was the construction of the Bellefontaine Railroad between 1848 and 1852. After
                    he lost control of this line in 1853, however, his further schemes created acrimonious controversy
                    and foundered without broad support.66
            
            At the same time, Indianapolis in the 1850s was open to well-mannered newcomers. According to a
                    sample from the manuscript census returns, the average age of employed persons owning
                    $5000 of real estate fell from 46.5 in 1850 to 40.0 in 1860. The proportion of the same
                    group born in the Middle West rose during the decade from 17 percent to 35 percent, indicating that
                    the Indiana capital was a haven for ambitious young Middle Westerners and a center of opportunity
                    for the state. A study by historian James H. Madison has found that a total of eighty-nine
                    businessmen—bankers, merchants, manufacturers, real estate agents, railroad officers,
                    livestock, lumber, and produce dealers—owned at least $10,000 of property in
                    1860. Fifty-eight had arrived in the city since 1850 and only seven had been present before 1835.
                    Wealth and presumably local influence were held by relatively young men, for only 46 percent of
                    these eighty-nine wealthiest business leaders were over forty.67
            
            The absence of divisive local issues helped to maintain a calm and measured tone in the economic
                    growth of Indianapolis. The antebellum decade saw little of the labor strife and awareness of
                    economic class divisions which marred the career of other cities.68 Similarly,

                     banking was treated as a question of state rather than civic
                    policy. Although the city's newspapers and businessmen divided over the hotly contested
                    issues of state banking policy, they spent their energy within the framework of political parties,
                    attempting to influence the state legislature rather than fighting with each other. Nor were there
                    rivalries among local railroad interests important enought to threaten local growth. Of the several
                    lines which followed the Madison Railroad into Indianapolis during the 1850s, only the Bellefontaine
                    and Indianapolis and the Indianapolis and Cincinnati required local money and enterprise.69 With the entrepreneurs of Terre Haute, Lafayette, Peru, Richmond, and
                    Jeffersonville energetically extending lines to converge at the capital, one of the major problems
                    of economic development was solved by outsiders. Between the completion of the Madison Railroad and
                    the start of the Civil War, the voters of Indianapolis did not once face the question of public aid
                    to railroads which plagued other cities.70
            
            In the absence of serious controversies about the basic issues of economic growth, public arguments
                    about economic policy in antebellum Indianapolis were relatively calm debates on specific measures.
                    The advocates of manufacturing at various times disagreed among themselves whether a rolling mill
                    was a practical project, scolded the council for exiling slaughterhouses beyond the city limits, and
                    argued whether real estate speculation hampered the expansion of manufacturing by raising land
                    prices and diverting local capital.71 The first years of railroad development

                    town or by an encircling belt line. In an era when fierce competition among railroad companies gave

                    is little evidence that anyone seriously tried to prevent the construction of a union passenger
                    depot south of the business district.72
            
            Efforts to free Indianapolis from Cincinnati's commercial dominance after the completion of
                    eastern rail connections in the early 1850s demonstrate the character of collective entrepreneurship
                    in the city. Businessmen were encouraged to invest in local manufacturing "so that we may
                    declare our independence of Cincinnati" and were urged to use the new railroads to bypass
                    Queen City merchants.73 The desire to build an Indianapolis economy free from
                    Cincinnati influence came to a head in a controversy over the redemption of currency from
                    Indiana's free banks. Cincinnati brokers in 1854, 1855, and 1856 gathered the Indiana bank
                    notes which accumulated in the Queen City and sent them to Indianapolis for conversion into specie.
                    Where Ohioans considered this merely a routine procedure, Indianapolis editors and businessmen
                    thought it a blatant effort to destroy the state's merchants and bankers. As Cincinnati
                    newspapers looked on in sincere puzzlement, Indianapolis prepared to repel the "piratical
                    incursion" of Ohio "rascals" and "bloodsuckers" and
                    called for a boycott of Cincinnati businesses.74 After two years of verbal
                    salvos, a commercial convention met at Indianapolis in April, 1856, and resolved that the state
                    should trade exclusively with Louisville, Toledo, and Cleveland.75 Two years
                    later, Indianapolis' attitude was summarized in the Journal:
                    "All the objection Cincinnati has to Indianapolis and other Indiana towns is that they will
                    not permit themselves to be squeezed, at all times, without resistance."76

            The pursuit of economic growth in Indianapolis was a coherent and practical process. It was not only
                    leading businessmen, but the majority of its articulate residents who shared a general agreement on
                    the desirability of economic expansion. Henry Ward Beecher, the city's most popular
                    religious leader in the 1840s, for example, edited an agricultural journal in order to develop the
                    state's "incomparable resources" and to promote "a large-minded,
                    intelligent, settled PUBLIC SPIRIT."77 The city's German
                    community also accepted the objectives of growth defined by the native leadership. Affirmations of
                    faith in the town's growth were a staple of Indianapolis newspapers, and few inhabitants
                    doubted that "Indianapolis bids fair to become the largest inland capital in the
                        Union."78
            
            At the same time, the city's inhabitants possessed a clear view of their prospects,
                    accepting many of the limitations arising from their location and making the most of its centrality.
                    Within the range of types of boosterism outlined earlier, Indianapolis was marked by realistic
                    attention to local circumstances rather than grandiose visions of spectacular growth. Even the
                    scarcity of eastern capital prevented the promotion of quixotic projects and dampened the cycle of
                    boom and bust. An early interest in retrospective articles on the not very historic town indicated
                    the pride which citizens took in their city and affirmed their belief that "it is no longer
                    a rugged, scattered village—but a city, young, vigorous and healthful, with a bright
                    future before it."79

            On March 28, 1881, William Gregory Harrison, a young farmer, summed up the activities of a day that
                    had turned from rain to snow by noting; "Nothing of much importance was done here. We sat
                    in the house and hoped for better times." This laconic comment is typical of the young
                    man's daily journal. He was rarely concerned with events beyond his immediate environment.
                    His journal is filled with the day-to-day minutae of living and the comings and goings on a typical
                    central Indiana farm of the 1880s. Life was filled with work, obviously hard, yet it was also filled
                    with diversity and, also obviously, had its rewards.
            The Harrisons of Morgan County were unrelated to the most famous Harrison family of Indiana, that of
                    William Henry and Benjamin Harrison. William Gregory's grandfather, William Harrison, was
                    born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Educated into the ministry, he became a teacher instead and
                    followed that vocation in Ohio, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Kentucky. In 1820 he married a young Ohio
                    widow, Martha Hitchcock.1William and Martha had six children: William Ripley,

                            family settled in Sandusky, Ohio, where she met and married William
               
                     Frederick Augustus, Virginius T. (Jake), Oscar Hamilton, Mary
                    Rebecca, and Martha.2
            
            Their eldest son, William Ripley—the Uncle Rip and W.R. of the journal—was the
                    most successful member of the family. Born in Knox County, Tennessee, on December 6, 1822, he grew
                    up in Maysville, Kentucky, where he studied law. In 1848 he moved to Martinsville, Indiana,
                    established a successful practice, speculated in land, and became a leading citizen of the
                    community. He was among the group of men who organized the First National Bank of Martinsville,
                    financed the Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Railroad, and incorporated the Parks,
                    Henderson, & Harrison pork-packing company. When he died on October 15, 1905, his obituary
                    listed him as one of Indiana's last pioneer lawyers.3
            
            William Ripley's brother and William Gregory Harrison's father, Frederick Augustus,
                    was born on March 14, 1829, in Pendleton County, Kentucky. During his youth he apprenticed as a
                    stonemason and blacksmith, trades which he followed throughout his life time. Several entries in the

                            death in November, 1840, she moved their children to Delaware County, Ohio. In 1851 she
                            joined her oldest son in Martinsville, Indiana, where she died on November 1, 1879. Biographical. Record, 150; Duke, "Genealogy of Harrison
                            Family." Duke gives Martha's death as 1878, but William Gregory's
                            journal entry for November 1, 1880, clearly indicates her death to have been in 1879.

                            ran a sawmill at Hynsdale, Jefferson Township, Morgan County, in 1874 and worked as a
                            gardener in the township in 1880. Jake purchased farmland in Jefferson Township in 1864, at
                            about the same time that he married Mrs. Lucinda Dunlap. They also resided in the township

                     example, indicate that Fred was much in demand for chimney
                    building in Jefferson Township. On November 2, 1850, he married a first cousin, Mary Elizabeth
                    Gregory, near Galena in Delaware County, Ohio. Their eldest son, Charles Ripley, was born on
                    September 17, 1852, at Galena, Ohio. William Gregory, author of the journal, was born on April 13,
                    1855, in Rome Corners, Ohio, and Alvin Daniel on August 27, 1857, near Galena. Some time after the
                    birth of Alvin, but before the birth of Delia Alvira on January 3, 1863, the family joined William
                    Ripley in Morgan County. Delia was born at William Ripley's house four miles west of
                    Martinsville as was Henry on October 23, 1865. Delia died on August 23, 1865, and Henry on July 24,

            On October 26, 1871, Fred Harrison purchased land from William Ripley Harrison consisting of the
                    "West half of the North East quarter of Section Twenty-six (26), and the East half of the
                    South West quarter of Section Twenty-three (23) Jefferson Township Twelve (12) North of Range One
                    (1) West containing 160 acres more or less."5 By the time of this
                    purchase, Fred had attained enough importance in Jefferson Township to have been appointed
                    enumerator for the 1870 census. He remained a prominent citizen in the township throughout his
                        lifetime.6 Tragedy, however, struck his family on December 5, 1879, when the
                    eldest son, Charles Ripley, died "after a night of suffering."7 Thus, at the time that the journal published here was written the family consisted only of
                    Fred, his wife Mary, William Gregory, and the younger brother, Alvin.
            Beyond the bare statistical facts of birth and death, the only available source of knowledge about
                    William Gregory is his journal. The picture of the young man—he was twenty-five in
                    1880—that the manuscript suggests is a pleasing one. The most important characteristics
                    are the writer's education and intelligence. The handwriting is exceptionally neat, the
                    spelling largely accurate, the sentence structure comparatively complex,

                     yet clear. References to local schools and spelling bees in
                    which he maintained a continued interest dot the journal. The title, "Chronicles of Upper
                    Burnet," supports a picture of the author's literary and, possibly, romantic
                    nature, reinforced by journal references to the novels he was reading and his frequent classical
                    allusions. The portion of the journal not reproduced here consists of a long, handwritten treatise
                    on mathematics and a short outline of the earth's dimensions and composition, showing an
                    interest in and a knowledge of science on the part of the writer. William Gregory's
                    educational attainments appear superior to those of most young Indiana farmers in that era. Almost
                    certainly his teacher-grandfather passed a love of learning to at least two of his children. A
                    nearby, well-educated lawyer uncle and the reading interests of Fred and Alvin noted in the journal
                    suggest that William Gregory and his family prized knowledge and education greatly.8
            
            William Gregory spent much of his time attending church functions, and his notes on the sermons
                    reveal a good understanding of the fundamentals of his religion.9 Yet, despite
                    his learned commentary, his church association was as much social as it was religious.
            His journal suggests a warm, gregarious, not exceptionally hardworking nature. The manuscript is
                    tinted with statements revealing a subtle sense of humor that apparently made William Gregory more
                    than just welcome among his contemporaries.
            The author's personal feelings are less distinct because the journal is not a diary. He
                    failed to pour his thoughts, values, beliefs, and hopes for the future into it. For example, while
                    William Gregory obviously enjoyed the company of young ladies, if one were special to him, he makes
                    no mention of her. Additionally, he fails to intimate any plans or hopes he might have for the
                    future. As the eldest living son, he might expect to inherit his father's farm, or,
                    possibly, to set up his own farm with his father's help. Regarding these logical
                    possibilities, however, the journal is silent.
            William Gregory's journal remains, therefore, a record of life on a late nineteenth-century
                    central Indiana farm. Much of 
                  
                     8 The tenor of a reference to James Gray having attended normal school
                            suggests that William Gregory was also a "normalite" at Martinsville. Ibid., April 17, 1881.
                  
                     9 Fred A. Harrison and his family were members of the Methodist
                            Episcopal Church. Martinsville Republican, November 17, 1904.
               
                     the day-to-day existence is repetious. Preparing food, tending
                    animals, planting and harvesting crops, attending church functions, and securing enough wood to meet
                    seemingly endless demands for lumber and fuel are activities that dominate family endeavors
                    throughout the year.
            Some points worth noting about farm life in central Indiana in the 1880s are reflected in the
                    "Chronicles of Upper Burnet." The amount of visiting between farms and the
                    frequent trips to town may surprise those who customarily think of nineteenth-century farm life as
                    isolated and lonely. The Harrison's proximity to Martinsville—they lived about
                    six miles away—facilitated their visits to town, and the relatively small landholdings
                    and the farm owners' dependence on each other contributed to the close, daily association
                    among neighbors. An extensive, interfarm barter and exchange system went hand-in-hand with this
                    relationship. The trading extended far beyond lending the sausage grinder to neighbors. When the
                    Harrisons slaughtered hogs, Bill Bunton arrived to collect any remnants from the butchering. Bill
                    Hand and Fred Harrison had at least one cornfield that they planted and harvested together on a
                    shares basis. The barter system also extended to town. While the Harrisons had an account at the
                    general merchandise store in Martinsville, a load of wood paid their subscription to the Morgan
                    County Gazette. Fred Harrison's continuous interest in improving the
                    value of his farm and living conditions is shown by the construction of the new cow barn and the
                    extension to the kitchen. Other points of interest described in the journal include the events of
                    the 1880 national elections, a spelling bee, gathering and storing ice in the winter, and making
                    maple sugar in the spring.
            William Gregory's personality and character dominate the journal despite the rich load of
                    farm life and lore that it contains. The picture of the author that the manuscript presents is one
                    of an intelligent, genial, and slightly romantic young farmer. One would like to meet him
                    personally. After reading the journal it comes as a distinct shock to learn that William Gregory was
                    dead less than a year after the last extant entry. He died on April 28, 1882, and younger brother
                    Alvin followed him on December 5, 1884.10

                        confirmed by a visit to the Bethlehem Cemetery, Jefferson Township. The fact that Charles,
                        William, and Alvin all died at the age of twenty-seven has entered the folklore of Morgan
                        County. Interviews with Lloyd Hancock, Jefferson Township, August
            
            
            Fred and Mary Harrison lived on into old age childless. They sold the last of the farm on September
                    26, 1891, and moved to Martinsville, probably to a house at 760 East Pike Street.11 Mary died on January 19, 1901.12 Fred was active in local politics
                    after her death, and in 1903 and 1904 he served as a city commissioner. About September, 1904, Fred
                    moved into the household of his brother, William Ripley, at 359 North Jefferson Street where he died
                    on November 11, 1904.13He and Mary are buried with their children in the
                    Bethlehem Cemetery, Jefferson Township, Morgan County, Indiana.
            The statement above that in his journal William Gregory Harrison expressed no hopes for the future is
                    not entirely correct. On the last day of 1880 he wrote; "It will sufficiently repay the
                    writer if these chronicles are ever of interest or use to any one." It is hoped that
                    publication of the "Chronicles of Upper Burnet" will to some degree fulfill its
                    author's wish.

                        discover the causes of death have proved unsuccessful. Death records for Morgan County do not
                        exist prior to 1900, and no mention of the three brothers appears in the extant newspapers.

                                                Ervin, Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. Spacings and indentions have been
                                                standardized, but spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure are as
                                                nearly as found in the handwritten document as possible. Obvious
                                                unintentional repetitions were deleted, raised letters brought down to
                                                the line, and double spaces added where sentences lacked periods. In all
                                                cases where the manuscript was unclear, common English usage prevailed.

                                                whenever such information was available. The use of nicknames and middle

                                        O'Neal6 and Mrs Jehu O'Neal7 were here before ten o clock to get old newspapers for pasting purposes.
                                    They got some few. About ten o'clock Father and Alvin started to town. I
                                    picked up some more crabapples and gathered nearly a half bushel of hickory nuts.
                                    The folks got back from town about five o'clock. They reported
                                    Claypool's speech8 splendid. Weather warm with high
                                    wind from the south and rain signs.
                        Sunday October 3rd
                        A bigger crowd than usual gathered at "singin" this morning on
                                    account of an expected breeze in consequence of our attempt to have one or two
                                    lessons at night but the matter was amicably arranged in our favor
                                    "singin" being announced for to-night As big a crowd was out in
                                    the afternoon. I took my lantern with me expecting to stay until the night lesson.
                                    It began to rain about four o'clock but quit till dark when it commenced
                                    again. But four came and they with the seven who staid went home in the rain about
                                    eight o'clock. Father hunted ginseng once during the forenoon or about
                                    noon, and Alvin went "jooking"9 after dinner
                                    getting caught in the first shower of rain It was warm before the rain.
                        Monday October 4th.
                        More people were here to-day than have been here on any one day in a long time before
                                    this. First came Charlie

                                            pleased by Judge Solomon Claypool's election speech supporting the
                                            1880 Democratic candidates. Local Republicans felt differently:
                                            "His speech was flat, stale and unprofitable, and didn't
                                            elicit a single cheer …. " Martinsville Republican, October 7, 1880.
                              
                                 9 "Jooking," as used by William
                                            Gregory, apparently means "hiking," although research in
                                            available records and interviews with older residents of Morgan County
                                            failed to verify this. "Jook" can also mean to crouch
                                            suddenly, or it can describe corn that falls from the sheaf when thrown from
                                            a stack. Neither definition fits the context in which it appears in the

                                     Warthen10 to buy the two
                                    oldest steer calves. After considerable talk he went away without buying them. Wat
                                    came along however and after a short talk decided to take them but could not drive
                                    them into the upper 80. Second came Bill Hand11 who sacked up 6
                                    bushels of his wheat and spent most of the forenoon cutting part of our crop of
                                    buckwheat The third arrival was "Marget," wife of Joseph
                                        Ballinger12 who came to get Pap to build Joseph's
                                    chimney. Fourth Wat and Dob Whitson13 as aforesaid. Fifth Bob
                                        Foster14 who came to get Bill Hand's wheat and
                                    staid till sundown; nearly two hours. His boys came down from school and went home
                                    when he did. Father worked most of the time at his building assisted by Alvin when
                                    A. wasn't helping Mother wash. I took the wagon; went over to Cal
                                        Curtis's,15 got the harrow and four bushels of
                                    wheat which Cal owed us as part pay for old Becky Jane the cow. I started a little
                                    before noon but was till nearly two o'clock getting home. Afterward I
                                    harrowed on the ground broken lately till night Weather comfortably cool, nearly
                                    clear.
                        Tuesday October 5th.
                        Alvin and I got the two steer calves Snoopkins and Burton the steer up into the upper
                                    80 without much trouble. So they are gone to help pay for the farm. Joe Ballinger
                                    coming through with a load of stoves Father went to town with him. I harrowed on the
                                    same ground till nearly eleven o clock, when I quit. Alvin and I went across the
                                    creek with the wagon and got the top of a dead sugar-tree that Fowlers16 cut across the road a few nights ago for coons. We hauled it to the
                                    house for firewood. Father got back at about two o'clock after which he and
                                    Alvin put in the time on the cow-stable and I chored around,

                                     besides gathering a lot more of hickory nuts.
                                    Weather same as yesterday with wind from the south-west. Some campaigners were
                                    shooting loud at long at no great distance tonight. Some more apple butter was made
                                    to-day. Father got some timothy seed at town, and just before night or at dusk sowed
                                    on the ground I had been harrowing this forenoon
                        Wednesday, October 6th.
                        Father was gone from breakfast to sundown, building a chimney for Joe Ballinger.
                                    Alvin and I were employed in the forenoon in getting the manure scattered around on
                                    the barn yard and hauling it into the field immediately below the house. After
                                    dinner we went up to Crone's burying ground17 and
                                    covered Charlies grave18 with a lot of transplanted ferns, thus
                                    trying a new experiment. We then loaded six short logs of the old church on the
                                    wagon and came home. Father cut some more of the buckwheat this morning. Weather
                                    warmer than yesterday, and clear all day
                        Thursday October 7th
                        Father cut part of the buckwheat before breakfast again, after it he disappeared
                                    again till dark on his chimney building contract. Alvin put in the day with team and
                                    wagon at working out our road tax. We hauled gravel all the time and dumped into a
                                    single mud-hole. Miss Effie adjourned her school19 this evening
                                    till next Monday and went home to enjoy tomorrow. Weather pretty warm, bright and
                                    clear
                        Friday, October 8th.
                        Father cut some more of the buckwheat this morning. About 9 o'clock all
                                    things being in readiness the three men of the household started to town in the
                                    wagon. We got there about 
                              
                                 17 The Crone Cemetery was located next to the Crone
                                            meetinghouse in section twenty-two, Jefferson Township. Some time before
                                            1880 the Crone meetinghouse was replaced by the Bethlehem Church and the
                                            burial ground is now known as the Bethlehem Cemetery. Lloyd Hancock and his
                                            uncle tore down the Bethlehem Church about 1936 or 1937. Cowen,

                                            Gregory's eldest brother, Charles Ripley, died on December 5, 1879.

                                     eleven o'clock and found humanity
                                    thronging the sidewalks on 3 sides of the square thickly. About half an hour
                                    afterward the street parade began. It was of great length. Delegations, glee clubs,
                                    banners, and large files of mounted men and women, many of them in uniform, stirred
                                    up a fearful dust and raised great enthusiasm. Uncle Ripley introduced the speaker
                                    Hon. Jas C. Robinson of Illinois who entertained the audience with a sensible
                                    homespun speech full of telling points. But little drunkenness in proportion to the
                                    size of the crowd. We got a letter from Grandmother.20 She seems
                                    to be comparatively happy. Mary Perkins is to be married on the 3rd of November
                                    next. Grandmother don't talk very strongly of coming out here. The day was
                                    warm and clear
                        Saturday October 9th.
                        It was hot to-day and there were signs of rain but none came.
                                    Father went to Ballingertown21 again to work at his chimney
                                    contract. He returned about five o clock having used all his brick and not got done.
                                    Alvin and I went to town in the hack this morning to deliver the butter. Crowds were
                                    gathering to attend the Republican grand rally.22 We did not
                                    stay long in town. An attempt was made to block the road a little this side of town
                                    but after some delay and bluster the right of way was granted. We had to draw up at
                                    the side of the road a little distance from this end of the bridge and wait perhaps
                                    half an hour for the procession from the south west and western parts of the county
                                    to pass. We got home before noon, and after dinner raked and set up the cut
                                    buckwheat which was full of burrs. Not a great deal of enthusiasm was exhibited in
                                    the part of rally that I saw though the crowd was immense; far greater than that of
                                    yesterday.

                                        Morgan County Republican rally of the 1880 campaign. The parade began at 10:30
                                        A.M. and the local pro-Republican newspaper reported that "the town was
                                        not big enough to accommodate the monster procession." Even allowing
                                        for overstatement it was a significant gathering. Martinsville Republican, October 14, 1880.

                        Sunday October 10th
                        I felt not precisely well all day. I seemed to have a great deal of phlegm in my
                                    throat and still have no proper cold. The day was very warm partly cloudy. Three
                                    "singins" were held on the creek to-day; forenoon, afternoon, and
                                    night. I attended a part of all three lessons. The crowd was small on all three
                                    occasions but still large enough. I was at Bob Foster's during most of the
                                    night "singin" talking to him and Rev. Mr Moore23 who was there. K. ygov jqog ykvj Cnjeg (2[?]) Hqyngt chvgt pkyv ukprkpi.24 The rest of the folks staid at home except Alvin who took a

                        Monday October 11th.
                        Nothing very noteworthy was done to-day. Alvin and I took the red and white cow
                                    "White-face" avisiting down to Wat's. We took old Peg
                                    with her and did not have more trouble than was to be expected. Alvin got back soon
                                    I was till eleven o'clock. Alvin helped Mother wash and I got the last
                                    hickory nuts I knew of that were on the place. I went down to where old Mr. Bain25 and his nephew John B. from Parke County were trying to burn
                                    the weeds off their wheatfield; with poor success. Father spent most of the day in
                                    Ballingertown and finished his job. The day was hot and cloudy. It sprinkled several
                                    times. Cal Curtis gathered some of his corn to-day
                        Tuesday, October 12th.
                        Father and Alvm put in the time till noon at work on their stable frame. By the aid

                                    and put in place. I chored around at various things got some walnuts and hulled
                                    them, and helped about the "raising" Just after dinner we hitched
                                    to the hack and went all three of us to Hyndsdale26 to vote. We

                                 25 Old Mr. Bain was probably Donald Bain, Sr. Born in
                                            Scotland on March 17, 1809, he immigrated first to Maryland, then moved to
                                            Jefferson Township in 1843. In 1880 he was a highly respected citizen and
                                            farmer. Blanchard, Counties of Morgan, Monroe and Brown,

                                     not long; got three straight Democratic tickets
                                    and exercised the freeman's right. Two of the tickets went in without a
                                    "scratch" about Father's I dont know. We were back home
                                    and at work again, before three o'clock, I at least in almost un-doubting
                                    faith that the Republican state and county ticket would be elected.27 Another section of the frame was raised before night. The day was cloudy
                                    and misty till towards noon when it cleared and began getting cooler.
                        Wednesday October 13th
                        Father and Alvin were at work all day at the stable and got the main frame nearly or
                                    quite completed. Bill Hand and his Illinois cousin made clap-boards down by the
                                    creek in the woods, where Pap and Nathe Whitson28 sawed a good
                                    while ago. I went over across the creek and fixed at the road into the woods. This
                                    took till noon after which I hitched to the wagon and three loads of wood down and
                                    put them a little outside the gate into the road. Dob Whitson came with
                                    Wat's wagon and borrowed the breaking plow just at night. Weather; some
                                    frost this morning clear and cool all day.
                        Thursday, October 14th.
                        It began to rain soon after daylight and kept at till noon and some time after when
                                    it cleared off. I spent the forenoon mostly where Bill Hand and his cousin were
                                    making clapboards I went back there about three o'clock but they were just
                                    quitting as Bill was almost sick. Tom Newbern 29 was there
                                    hunting stone for his hearth and I staid with him awhile, after which I went down to
                                    where Dan Bain and Parke Co. John were breaking up a field. Alvin and Father worked
                                    at their stable when it was not raining
                        Friday, October 15th.
                        It rained in showers from early morn till dewy eve. I went and got Cinda the calf
                                    back into her pasture from whence she

                                            stronghold. In 1880 the G.O.P. campaigned on the "bloody
                                            shirt" of the Civil War and the prevailing prosperity in the
                                            nation. William Gregory's faith was rewarded and the state and
                                            county Republican ticket was victorious. Martinsville Republican, October 7, 14, 21, 1880; T. Harry Williams, Richard N.

                                     had escaped, went around the ridge to the
                                    school house and talked to Bill awhile then came home; found Father preparing to go
                                    to town in the wagon to get some cow feed ground, and I got in and went along. I
                                    went to Dr. Cure's office30 and got me a bottle of
                                    cough medicine and lounged around while Father made some purchases and got a load of
                                    lumber. We got home about two o'clock. The Hand boys got done making boards
                                    at the creek and came into the woods above the stable where they cut another tree
                                    and made some more boards.
                        Saturday October 16th.
                        Father and Alvin put in at least part of the time on the cow stable. The Hand boys
                                    didn't get here till nine o'clock. About 10.30 o'clock I
                                    started to town in the hack. Got to Uncle Rip's at just noon and ate dinner
                                    with them W. R. himself was not at home. I went up into Mr Shirley's
                                        office31 talked to him and Mr Henderson32 on politics awhile, went to mill and got the meal (which was left
                                    yesterday), and about three o'clock started home. It had been blowing hard
                                    from the south all day and had got very chilly. I was so chilled when I got home
                                    that I had no appetite and went to bed where I soon got as well as I was
                                    before-apparently

                        But I still did'n't feel very well to-day. The winds continued to
                                    blow more or less hard all day—heavy masses of dark cloud floated over
                                    and a few times during the day snow fell. I went

                                            taking charge of his father's farm and making his fortune by
                                            trading stock. He served as both the Morgan County deputy county treasurer
                                            and county treasurer and was a state senator from 1868 to 1872. In 1873, he,

                                    corn throwing the ears on the ground. Mother and Alvin washed. After dinner Alvin
                                    and I went with the wagon and got the corn I had pulled There was a wagon-bed full
                                    of it. Then I hauled a load of wood for the fire-place by myself while Alvin went
                                    around and dug two baskets full of his sweet potatoes. Father had finished the patch
                                    close by. He and I went down to the gravel-pit below Bain's and got some
                                    rock to put under the shed-sill. I then hauled Alvin's sweet potatoes and
                                    quit. Rhoda Hand35 came this afternoon and begged a lot of old
                                    papers. John Crone36 was here just before night to get Father to
                                    fix their chimney Promise given to do so. Mrs. "Meter" Benge37 was around trying to buy corn but could'n't
                                    here. It froze pretty hard last night and was cold all day. We have probably five
                                    bushels of old corn.

                        Tuesday October 19th.
                        It was snowing when we got up and kept at it till nearly noon. It only got a couple
                                    of inches deep in spots however. The sky cleared at noon and the snow disappeared.
                                    Father rode up to Mrs. Crone's this morning but could'n't
                                    do anything as they had a fire in the "place." So he soon came
                                    back and disappeared again till noon. I spent a little while with Wat who came up to
                                    salt his cattle after dinner and spent about two hours and a half digging
                                    Alvin's sweet potatoes; got about a bushel. Father worked at his stable
                                    part of the time. The Hand boys came after dinner and he put them at work on another
                                    tree across the creek. Alvin squizzed38 most of the forenoon and
                                    helped Father a little in the afternoon.
                        Wednesday, October 20th.
                        Father went off to Mrs. Crone's again this morning. Alvin and I went down
                                    and hauled wood across the creek as I did last Wednesday. We also helped
                                    Hand's boys a little with their logs. Alvin came back to the house and dug
                                    some more sweet potatoes but I hauled till noon. After dinner, Alvin and I went to
                                    digging Irish potatoes immediately below the house. The yield was small, about three
                                    bushels of eatable potatoes for the afternoon's work. Father got home about
                                    three o clock. Bill Hand came to the house at the same time having finished his tree
                                    and got some meal. Father worked at the stable till night. The day was a good deal
                                    warmer but there was the hardest frost of the season this morning.
                                        Jake39 was here awhile this forenoon but
                                    on what errand was not discovered.
                        Thursday October 21st.
                        Alvin and I hauled up the clap boards made yesterday and the day before and stacked
                                    them up close to the new building. This took till ten o'clock after which
                                    we finished hauling the wood which is to go to town, across the creek. After dinner
                                    I dug potatoes till night. Father worked at the building till a little before night
                                    when he helped me a while with the 
                              
                                 38 The meaning of "squiz" is
                                            uncertain. Internal evidence suggests that it may refer to some kind of
                                            woodworking. See especially the journal entry for January 19, 1881. Lloyd
                                            Hancock has suggested that Alvin might be making apple cider and the
                                            "squiz-shop" was a cider press. Interview with Lloyd

                                 39As noted in the introduction, William
                                            Gregory's uncle, Virginius T. (Jake) Harrison, forty-eight, and his
                                            wife Lucinda, forty-nine, owned a Jefferson Township farm. U.S., Tenth

                                     potatoes. Alvin worked at the building all the
                                    afternoon. It rained a small thunder-shower last night, but was clear and warm
                                    to-day.
                        Friday, October 22nd.
                        It rained a small shower this morning before daylight, but quit entirely about eight
                                    o clock except a couple of very small sprinkles. Work on the building was not very
                                    much interrupted. I chored around till after dinner when we all three soon finished
                                    digging potatoes. I also went around and dug the few remaining sweet potatoes in
                                    Alvin's patch together with a few Irish "taters" that had
                                    been planted there I likewise went down to where we plowed a big patch of
                                        peach-blows40 under the clover but there was very nearly
                                    nothing there. Father went away, professedly to Wat's, after supper
                        Saturday, October 23rd.
                        It was a cold raw day, cloudy, with occasional small sprinkles. Father and Alvin put
                                    in the day at the building. I went to town in the hack taking a sackful of wheat
                                    belonging to Bill Hand. I made several purchases for the family and got a pair of
                                    heavy boots for myself. I got back home about two o clock and hauled two loads of
                                    wood, one being chunks picked up in the pasture and one wood cut last spring across
                                    the creek. Bill Hand came and got his flour about four o'clock. Sam
                                        Howoll41 rode home with me
                        Sunday, October 24th
                        I started down to Wat's a-visiting for the day; got down to Bain's
                                    and met him coming away. I then came back up on the creek where singing-school was
                                    in full blast with a more than average attendance of spectators. I did not go to the
                                    afternoon lesson till nearly four o'clock and did'n't
                                    come home till after the night session H vdms gnld whsg Qabgdk Aqnvm. Father went to
                                    "singin" in the afternoon awhile. The day was bright, clear, and
                                    comfortably warm.
                        Monday October 25th.
                        I put in most the forenoon pulling off another lot of corn and throwing it on the
                                    ground. It was in Bill Hand's wheat-field. 
                              
                                 40 Peach-blows were large, smooth-skinned potatoes.

                                     Father and Alvin spent the time on the
                                    building. Em and her baby42 came in their buggy and staid most
                                    of the day. After dinner Father and I went to town with a load of the wood down at
                                    the road. We had the side boards on the wagon and the bed full so that we had
                                    perhaps 3/4 of a cord on. Each of us then paid our tax or rather Father paid all of
                                    it amounting to $10.78 his $8.38; mine $2.40. It
                                    was dark when we got home. It was clear and warm till night when it clouded up and
                                    began raining. Alvin chored and played around during the afternoon.
                        Tuesday October 26th.
                        The day was damp cloudy and disagreeable. Work on the everlasting cow barn however
                                    progressed without interruption. I was sent up to Bob Foster's to see about
                                    some potatoes but found him not. I soon came back and found Jake here. He wanted a
                                    barrel of salt hauled out from town. He soon left. I hitched to the wagon, went down
                                    and picked up the corn I pulled yesterday. I left part of it on the pen in the
                                    calf-lot and brought the rest of it to the crib. After dinner, Alvin helping me
                                    load, I started with a load of wood to town. When I arrived at Donald
                                        Bain's,43 for the first time in the family history,
                                    the king-bolt of the wagon broke. I borrowed one of Bain's, partly unloaded
                                    the wagon and with the help of the boys got things righted, and started on again.
                                    After unloading I drove down to Kiefer's44 had the
                                    king-bolt mended then went and got Jake's salt, and lastly got home about
                                    six o'clock. Nathe Whitson came this afternoon and got his broad-ax
                        Wednesday October 27th.
                        Bob Foster was here a short time this morning after some sow-belly. He got some. I
                                    hitched up, and started to town about nine o'clock Alvin helping me to
                                    load. I procured a pair of oil-tanned buck-skin gloves (I believe that is what the
                                    clerk called them) and some sugar for Mother and raced home getting here before one
                                    o'clock. Father helped load after dinner

                                 44 Julius C. Keifer, thirty-eight, was a Martinsville
                                            blacksmith in 1880. The Morgan County history lists him as running an

                                     and I went to town again but got back about
                                    six. Father worked most of the time at his cow-stable assisted by Alvin when he was
                                    not helping Mother wash It was a cloudy cool, sour day.
                        Thursday, October 28th.
                        And it was more or less the same kind of weather all day to-day. Alvin and I started
                                    in the hack after breakfast to the village of Wilbur, (vulgarly called
                                        Lick-skillet.)45 We went after apples and were to get them
                                    at Mr Horace Pearce's.46 The gentleman named was not at
                                    home himself, but his wife helped us to get five bushels of very nice-looking winter
                                    apples for which she charged us the steep price of 75 cents per bushel. I euchered
                                    myself by giving 35 cents for a bushel of, as I though[t] slightly rotten ones which
                                    turned out to be of very small account. I also acted the fool in running a
                                    wild-goose chase after Mr. Miller Howell,47 in the direction
                                    opposite to that I should have taken to find him. It was nearly noon when I found
                                    him got five dollars from him and started on the homeward six miles and two
                                    o'clock when we got here. Bob Foster came with about twelve bushels of
                                    potatoes for us about three o'clock. I hauled up a load of those clap
                                    boards which were made across the creek. Father spent the day on his cow-stable
                                    again. Sally (Jake's girl)48 was here just at night to
                                    see about their salt.
                        Friday, October 29th.
                        Bob Foster was on hand pretty early and Father and he spent the day putting the roof
                                    on the new building. They lacked one course of getting half the roof on. Alvin also
                                    helped at it in various ways. I took another load of wood to town. I delivered it to
                                    Mr E. W. Callis.49 All that I have hauled before this has

                                            blacksmith or two, a carpenter, a saw mill, a post office, and from a half

                                            where he bought the Morgan County Gazette. He edited the

                                     been delivered to Mr. Faulkner.50 I got home at one o'clock after which Alvin and I hauled up
                                    the remainder of the clap boards across the creek. We hauled a little wood in the
                                    last load. Jake was down with his team and sled after his barrel of salt this
                                    morning.
                        Saturday, October 30th.
                        Father and I went to town in the hack. I was up at Uncle Rip's a few moments
                                    only, I made no purchases. Father bought a few necessaries and we started home
                                    before noon. There was to be a Republican rally in town to-day. Many people were
                                    there but not more than the average Saturday crowd. Father and Alvin put in their
                                    time till night on the building. Alvin worked at it part of the forenoon. It was
                                    heavily cloudy all day and rained slightly at noon. It was a good deal warmer.
                        Sunday, October 31st.
                        This was positively "the last day without more pay" of James
                                    Holmes's "singin" on the creek.51
                                    Enough money was made up to have a lesson in the afternoon. I attended in the
                                    forenoon but put on my very good duds and started to Bethlehem52
                                    in the afternoon. Went up to "singin" awhile, which made me so
                                    late at Crone's that I only heard Mr Moore's concluding sentences.
                                    Father was up at the creek in the forenoon and jooking at some nameless place awile
                                    after dinner. Alvin made a circuit of about a mile this forenoon via
                                    Fowler's and Bob Foster's. Effie and Aunt Mary were here a few
                                    moments in the evening. Lila was also along.53 I had some severe
                                    twinges of neuralgia toothache before going to bed. It was a splendid clear cool
                                    day.
                        Monday, November 1st.
                        Bob Foster was promptly on the scene and Father, Alvin, and he spent the day on the
                                    cow-stable roof. When night came it only lacked two courses of being done. I went to
                                    town with a 
                              
                                 50 Squire W. Faulkner, fifty, ran a Martinsville hotel
                                            and restaurant, the Faulkner House. Wounded in the abdomen during the Civil

                                     load of wood. I went up into Uncle Rips office
                                    to make a political inquiry, gawked around town a little while and got home by one o
                                    clock. After eating I hauled, Alvin helping, two loads of clap boards from the
                                    pasture not far from the stable; then turned the horses out and about night began a
                                    job of digging at the end of the kitchen. It was a nice clear cool day—a
                                    "weather-breeder" I presume. Aleck Benge54 and
                                    John Bain55 were both present for a short time on the premises
                                    business unknown. Grandmother Harrison died a year ago today56
                        
                        Tuesday, November 2nd.
                        Still another nice clear cool day. I put in the forenoon mostly digging at my job
                                    begun last evening. Father and Alvin got the roof of the cow-stable done about two
                                    o'clock, after which we three men folks went in the hack to Hyndsdale to
                                    exercise the right of suffrage. We all three voted for the Hancock electors57 and did not tarry long getting home about four o clock. Billy
                                        Ballinger58 came home with us. Father and Alvin went to
                                    flooring the building and I did some more digging
                        To-day completes the thirtieth year of Father and Mother's married life.
                        Wednesday November 3rd.
                        Aleck Benge was here early this morning to get a job of gathering corn but
                                    did'n't get it. Father and I went to town with the last load of
                                    wood. The news of Garfield's assured triumph did not astonish us much.59 We made some necessary purchases but were bothered with so
                                    many jobs that it was four 
                              
                                 54 Probably William A. Benge, twenty-three, a young

                                 58 William Ballinger, twenty-one, was a farm laborer
                                            residing in 1880 on a Jefferson Township farm with his brother-in-law,

                                 59 By November 3, 1880, the Republican victory had
                                            been forecast. By that time James A. Garfield was reported to have 231
                                            electoral votes. Only 185 were required for victory. Ultimately, the
                                            Republican candidate received 214 electoral votes; although his popular vote
                                            was only slightly larger than Hancock's. Martinsville Republican, October 28, 1880; Williams, Current, and Friedel, History of the United States, II, 183.
                           
                                     o'clock when we got home. Alvin nearly
                                    finished up the job of digging at the kitchen end, and chored around. The day was
                                    cloudy cool and threatening, warmer at night. Jake was here just at dark and
                                    borrowed Alvin's cabbage cutting squig.60
                        
                        Thursday, November 4th.
                        Stoke Stiles Senior61 was here pretty soon after breakfast to see
                                    about buying Charley Warthen's part of the corn in the lower field. Bob
                                    Foster came a short time after Stokely left and about 9 o'clock he and I
                                    went to Charley Warthen's sale. A good sized crowd was there, considerable
                                    fun was had, bidding was not very spirited and things went rather cheap. I came home
                                    at two o'clock. Alvin went to Jake's to instruct them in the
                                    correct use of the kraut-cutter62 and also went to Dan
                                        Kirk's63 to return a picture he had framed. Father
                                    spent most of the day flooring the main part of his new cow-barn, assisted by Alvin
                                    after he got back. After I returned we all three went across the creek and sawed off
                                    three oak logs to make barn-floors of. Got back by four o'clock and more
                                    floor was laid while I chored around. It rained a good part of last night and part
                                    of the forenoon was cloudy and threatening the rest of the day. Jap Bunton64 was here and got a bit of salt pork.
                        Friday, November 5th.
                        It rained a small amount last night and was cloudy and damp all day. Alvin and I
                                    gathered the twelve bushels of corn or so which remained on that standing uncut in
                                    the rye patch. I also hauled a load of fireplace wood from across the creek to the
                                    house. After dinner Alvin made a wooden cross for Effie; and I gathered a load of
                                    corn from the "crooked field. Alvin helped me from three o'clock
                                    till dark. Father spent most of his time laying floor in the main part of his
                                    building. Stokely Stiles the

                                 61 Probably Stokely Stiles, born October 12, 1831, and
                                            died December 12, 1912, who was a Jefferson Township farmer. He served in
                                            Company F, 148th Indiana Volunteers and in 1880 owned 420 acres of land.

                                     elder was here to see about the Warthen corn
                                    again. He is to take it. Charley himself was where I was gathering this afternoon to
                                    see about it.
                        Saturday November 6th.
                        The rains descended last night and to-day till ten o'clock without
                                    interruption. At ten it began to snow and kept at it unceasingly till dark. In-door
                                    life was the order of the day Alvin spent the day agreeably to himself in the shop
                                    working at his saw-mill. Father did nothing in particular nor did I except to write
                                    a letter to Grandmother.
                        Sunday, November 7th.
                        It was pretty cold last night and clear and cool all day. I was gone from home all
                                    the time after breakfast till dark. I was at Wat's during the time
                                    mentioned. Os and "Dutch" Dan Bain65 were
                                    there most of the time. We had a feast of reason and a flow of soul to some extent
                                    also considerable fun. Alvin went up to Jake's awhile in the afternoon
                                    Nothing noteworthy occurred here
                        Monday, November 8th
                        It was partly cloudy to-day and rained a little about eleven o'clock but
                                    soon quit. Father went to town this morning with the wagon. Bill Hand came just
                                    before he started and taking a sack of his wheat went along. Father got home after
                                    one o'clock. Before that time I was mainly occupied in finishing up the job
                                    of digging at the kitchen's end. Alvin went to Jake's immediately
                                    after breakfast and was gone till nearly dark. Father and I got things ready,
                                    kettle, sled, etc. and killed the black sow knocking her on the head with the ax
                                    after a good deal of fooling with the old musket. It was a good deal of trouble
                                    throughout for lack of preparations. Em gave Father 18 heads of cabbage when he came
                                    home.
                        Tuesday November 9th
                        Father and Alvin went in the wagon above the city and about 10.30 o'clock
                                    reappeared with a heavy load of rock of which part was for use in the cow-shed and
                                    part at the kitchen 
                              
                                 65 "Dutch" Dan Bain was probably
                                            Daniel M. Bain twenty-three, a cousin living on William Bain's
                                            Jefferson Township farm. "Os" was probably William
                                            Gregory's uncle, Oscar Hamilton, listed as a gardner on the same
                                            farm. U.S., Tenth Census, 1880, p. 176.
                           
                                     end. Wat came up with Jimmy Bishop66 driving some cattle to the Upper 80. The two steer calves he
                                    got of us, came home last Saturday and I helped him get them back. I came home and
                                    carried five basketsfull of seed corn up stairs to keep away from mice and freezing.
                                    I was then sent after our sausage-grinder which had been at Wm Riley
                                        Nosler's67 for a long time I went, procured it, and
                                    got back by dinner time besides interviewing several of my neighbors on the way.
                                    After dinner Father went to town with the wagon, taking half the sow killed
                                    yesterday to sell, and the head, neck-bone, some old "belly," and
                                    one foot, saved from the cats, to give to Bill Bunton68 who
                                    began a job of cutting wood in our woods across the creek this morning. Alvin and I
                                    were put to work fixing a bad place in the road a little below the lower corn-field.
                                    Alvin was needed at the house but I "staid with" that job till
                                    dark. Tom and Pete Newbern69 were gathering in
                                    Warthen's corn to-day. They took one load home and brought one up here to
                                    our crib. Jim Singleton70 was here a moment at dinner-time;
                                    business unknown. Jake's Sally was also here during the day after arnica.
                                    The day was partly cloudy and a good deal warmer.
                        Wednesday, November 10th.
                        It rained hard at least part of last night and the wind blew in fearful gusts from
                                    the south all the afternoon and part of the forenoon. Heavy masses of cloud floated
                                    over and there was an occasional spitting of rain. Father was away on business at
                                    Mrs Joel Moore's during the forenoon. In the afternoon he and Alvin went
                                    with the wagon and got some more logs from the old Crone church to be used in the
                                    cow-stable. I chored around at various things during the day. Alvin did likewise
                                    during the forenoon besides helping Mother wash. It was rather warm but got a little
                                    cooler towards night I believe Aleck Benge gathered the corn on his contract
                                    yesterday.
                        
                           
                              66 James Bishop, the fifteen-year-old brother of Margarett
                                        Emma Harrison, lived at Wat's in 1880, working on the farm. Ibid., p. 177.
                           
                              67 Probably William Riley Nosier, forty-three, who ran a
                                        sawmill in Jefferson Township. He was born in Owen County, Indiana, on November
                                        9, 1835, and came to Morgan County in 1876. Ibid., p. 176;

                              69 Probably Peter Newburn, seventeen, a servant on the
                                        Stokley Stiles farm. His brother owned a Jefferson Township farm. See footnote

                        Thursday November 11th.
                        The clouds had nearly all disappeared but it was some colder and the winds blew hard
                                    from different directions in the course of the day. Until ten o clock we were all
                                    three occupied in putting the logs hauled yesterday in position. At ten
                                    o'clock Father started to town with the wagon while Alvin put down the oak
                                    plank hauled Tuesday on the logs we had just placed in the new cow-shed. I went over
                                    to where Bill Bunton was cutting wood and also interviewed Fowler's who
                                    were gathering corn not far from him; and came home. Mr. Henry Crone71 made his usual quarterly call to get money for Mr Moore. He got 75
                                    cents, 50 from Alvin, 25 from me. Father got home between three and four
                                    o'clock with some more oak planks, and after supper went to laying them
                                    down for the cow-shed floor. Prof. W. D. Bain of the college on the hill72came down after school to borrow the brass kettle. Our horses
                                    have a touch of the epizootic or something like it.
                        Friday November 12th.
                        The day was put in or the greater part of it in extending the kitchen. The end was
                                    sawed out another sill connected with the old one by some short pieces three feet
                                    long, then it was sided up as before and a roof sloping to the north and consisting
                                    of one course of shaved oak shingles and one course of clapboards was put on. It was
                                    not finished to-day. While Father and Alvin were doing this I swept off the main
                                    floor of the cow-barn and about ten o'clock went to gathering corn. I
                                    gathered about 5 bushels for the hogs before dinner, and finished up the
                                    "crooked field" after dinner. I quit awhile before sundown and
                                    Alvin and I hauled up three loads of the buckwheat and put it on the floor I had
                                    swept. The day was cold raw and generally clear
                        Saturday November 13th
                        Father and Alvin laid the floor in the kitchen extension. The kitchen is now three
                                    feet longer and I don't know how much colder. At about ten o clock Father
                                    and I started in the

                                     hack to town. I was up at Uncle Rip's
                                    a few moments. Various things hindered our starting back till three o clock. When we
                                    got here supper was eaten and immediately afterward Alvin and I went to hauling in
                                    the rest of the buckwheat. It took us a good while after sunset as it did yesterday
                                    but the moonlight was bright. We also hauled up a jag of fireplace wood afterward.
                                    It was a cold sour day. Bro Runyon held forth at Lamb's creek at night and
                                    I went. I was gallivinating over the country with girls and boys till 1
                                    o'clock
                        Sunday, November 14th.
                        A cloudy (or partly so) very raw cold day. We had a chase of about two hours this
                                    forenoon after about a dozen of Bain's hogs which finally went into
                                    Fowler's pasture. Two more were seen this afternoon and put into the road.
                                    Bro. Runyon preached at the creek in the forenoon and at night both of which sermons
                                    I sat and at least partially listened to. The A.M. sermon was professedly devoted to
                                    laying down an infallible rule to follow to insure salvation; in the evening he
                                    tried to show what Conversion was—with his usual success. The interval
                                    between the sermons I spent at Donald Bain's. James G. Bain and family were
                                        there.73 Effie H. was at the creek church at night for the
                                    first time in her life I reckon.
                        Monday, November 15th.
                        It was cloudy all day, snowed a little about noon and blew very cold, and raw, and
                                    hard from the south all day. Father and I went to Donald Bain's with the
                                    wagon and got some seasoned lumber to make barn doors of. We came back and Alvin and
                                    Father went to making the doors while I hauled two loads of wood for the fire-place
                                    from across the creek, I then unhitched the horses, stabled them, and chored around
                                    till night. After supper I went up and heard Mr. Runyon reason to the sinners
                                    without visible effect. I was at home by 8.30 o'clock. A hog of
                                    Bain's caused us some trouble again but finally disappeared.
                        Tuesday, November 16th.
                        A day like yesterday, excepting the snow which came last night and staid all day. It
                                    was very slight however. Till noon 
                              
                                 73 James G. Bain, thirty-six, was editor and publisher
                                            of the Martinsville Republican, now Recorder, and the

                                     Father and Alvin made doors for the cow-barn
                                    (or "church" as it is to be entitled) and hung them while I chored
                                    around. After dinner Alvin and I went down into the field south of the rye-patch and
                                    gathered part of a load of corn. At night I again went to hear the Rev. Runyan
                                    preach this time on the Remission of Sins. He completely (in his own estimation at
                                    least) killed and buried every ism but Campbellism;74 destroyed
                                    the witness of the spirit as efficacious evidence, established the necessity of
                                    baptism for remission and was rewarded with three female "jiners"
                        Friday [sic], November 17th
                        It began snowing last night and continued at it all day to-day without however
                                    getting a depth of more than three inches on the ground. It was rather disagreeable
                                    out-doors however and Father and Alvin went to ceiling up the kitchen. I chored
                                    around and about eleven o clock started up to the creek church to witness the
                                    baptizing of two of the unfortunate converts made last night. The air was very cold.
                                    Finding that they were going a considerable distance from the church I struck out
                                    for Loper's school-house.75 There were perhaps 20
                                    scholars and everything appeared to be going on prosperously. I staid till one o
                                    clock, then started home. The kitchen was not nearly completed.
                        Thursday, November 18th.
                        Thermometer indicated 5† below zero this morning, the snow was six inches
                                    deep, the sky clear, and remained so during the day but though it got considerably
                                    warmer before night there was not much thaw. Father started to town to mill in the
                                    hack about ten o'clock and got home about three. He brought a letter from
                                    Grandmother who appears to be in fair health, reasonably contented, and says she has
                                    determined to stay where she is this winter and come next spring prepared to 
                              
                                 74 Campbellism was a Protestant doctrine taught by Dr.
                                            Alexander Campbell who rejected complexity and denominational development.
                                            "Man, he believed, must find Christ by restoring first-generation
                                            biblical Christianity." Martin E. Marty, Righteous

                                 75 Loper's schoolhouse could not be
                                            identified with certainty. A journal entry for December 17, 1880, indicates
                                            Effie Harrison was teaching there. An entry for January 19, 1881, shows her
                                            teaching at School Number 7. If these two schools were the same, then
                                            Loper's is better known as the Buffalo schoolhouse.
                           
                                     end her days with us. She inclosed a photograph
                                    but did not reveal the original. We finally about agreed that it was taken from a
                                    daguerreotype of Mother which she sat for when she was 17 or 18 years of age but
                                    where discovered we knew not, nor how. John Kivett76 was here
                                    awhile in the afternoon. He brought some canned fruit with him to put in our cellar.
                                    It was in rather a damaged state from last nights freeze. Chopping wood, choring
                                    around and helping Mother wash were the main occupations here at the house.
                        Friday, November 19th.
                        12† below zero a little before sunrise. It got warmer during the day,
                                    remained clear till night when it clouded up. It thawed but little during the day
                                    however. Father and Alvin passed a good part of their time in the
                                    "church" flailing and fanning out buckwheat. I chopped wood around
                                    and chored about. Besides I went on two unsuccessful errands. I "hoofed
                                    it" up to Bob Foster's to get Robert to help us kill a beef but he
                                    was gone to town for the day. About four o'clock I started with the hack to
                                    get Effie. On arriving at Fowler's I was told that she was sick and looking
                                    for me. I pushed on, and at Riley Nosler's I found that she had gone to Mrs
                                        Allen's77 I drove up to Mrs.

                                    indisposed but felt well enough then. I pushed on back without her and it was dark
                                    before I got home. I jerked the catch off the hack singletree against a gate post.
                        Saturday, November 20th
                        I was in a rather singular state of feeling physically this day. I had a small
                                    toothache, during the night and found the pain scattered in a kind of neuralgic
                                    affection through my whole system. I wrote a letter to Grandmother this forenoon and
                                    sent it when Pap went to town. He and Alvin finished threshing out the buckwheat and
                                    about eleven o'clock Father started to town. He got the grinding which he
                                    had left last Thursday and a pair of stoga boots79 for Alvin.
                                    While he was

                                    buckwheat. The day was clear, a great deal warmer then yesterday but no very fast
                                    thawing was done yet.
                        Sunday November 21st
                        Not much space will be required to chronicle the events of to-day. No one went
                                    anywhere nor was anything done except the feeding and wood-getting. My face was no
                                    better and made me fevery so that I could hardly bear the cold, and I staid pretty
                                    closely in the house. Alvin had a pestiferous set of chillblains that afforded him
                                    occupation. It was rather colder than yesterday, and clear. We saw no human outside
                                    of the family but John Fowler who passed through about sundown
                        Monday, November 22nd.
                        12† below zero at the coldest this morning. Was very still all day and
                                    clear. It was a little colder than yesterday. Alvin got done fanning the buckwheat
                                    the first time and was nearly all day at it. Father chored around at various things
                                    and after dark took a journey to Wat's but was back by eight
                                    o'clock as he did'n't find Wat. I was better than
                                    yesterday and chopped some in the afternoon.
                        Tuesday, November 23rd.
                        6† below zero this morning and got up to 28† above before
                                    night, thus making a nice, clear, day, (in comparison). Father went up to Bob
                                    Foster's but that gentleman was gathering corn and could not well come.
                                    Father came back, chopped down a tree, and he and Alvin snaked the logs it made to
                                    the house with the horses, I helping. I also cut down a stub not far from the house.
                                    Alvin and I hauled up a small sled-load of fodder. Nathe Whitson having come after
                                    old newspapers for pasting purposes and having his rifle along was induced to stay
                                    and help kill the red heifer designated in last year's chronicles as Bertha
                                    or Burton the cow. It weighed at the outside 60 Ibs. to a quarter dressed but it was
                                    not weighed. Albert Bishop80 came with the wagon and borrowed
                                    the quilted frames for Wat's wife. Wat himself was here after supper
                                    business unknown

                                        brother, was born on July 8, 1863, and died on October 22, 1907. Cowen,

                        Wednesday, November 24th
                        According I suppose to promise made yesterday Bob Foster came soon this morning to
                                    help kill the heifer and was much gratified to find that his help was not needed.
                                    For it was snowing when we got up and kept at it all day. The former snow had only
                                    thawed off in favourable places. It was about three inches deep again on those
                                    places at 9 o'clock P.M. Nothing much was done but get wood, except that
                                    Father went to town after dinner, taking half of the beef killed yesterday, in the
                                    hack. Bob brought back some corn (five sacks I think) this morning which he had
                                    borrowed at times Father bought him a pair of gum boots to-day and a copy of
                                    Scott's novel "Redgauntlet"
                        Thursday November 25th.
                        Thanksgiving Day was not observed here. Father and Alvin spent the time in ceiling up
                                    the kitchen, overhead. They did not get quite done and have another day's
                                    work I think on the sides I chopped wood and chored around. My jaw is still swelled
                                    and ever since last Saturday, eating has been a painful operation to me. This is
                                    growing a trifle monotonous. The new snow was about four inches deep this morning
                                    The day was cloudy till night then clear. It neither froze in the shade nor thawed
                                    much in the sun
                        Friday November 26th
                        It was snowing awhile this morning but mercifully did not continue at it very long,
                                    so that we had not a great deal more snow than before. The rest of the day was as
                                    yesterday. The work of ceiling up the kitchen progressed all day and was not
                                    finished at night. It was so nearly so however that Mother moved in and took
                                    possession again. I chopped and chored around as usual. I manufactured into firewood
                                    the last of the willow poles I grubbed last spring Jaw about the same.
                        Saturday, November 27th.
                        A clear day with some thaw in the afternoon. John Kivett and son and Bill Hand came
                                    around this way with John's sled before we had eaten breakfast. They were
                                    going to town and had come after some of Bill's wheat. Father and I bundled
                                    up and went with them. I to see about getting my jaw cured. Dr. Cure merely gave me
                                    a bottle of liniment. I went up to Uncle Rip's and staid too long as the
                                    boys could'n't find me and left me. I however came in Rol
                                    Mosier's wagon one hour later.  Alvin
                                    entirley finished ceiling up the kitchen and chored around. I didn't feel
                                    any better for my trip when I got home.
                        Sunday November 28th
                        It drizzled a fog in large drops all day and made things icy for a time. My face was
                                    worse. I could barely get any thing between my jaws and spent most of the time in
                                    bed. Alvin spent most of the day at his uncle Jacob's. Pap staid closely in
                                    the house. I have forgotten to state that yesterday I got a letter from Frona81 that had gone to Uncle Rip's and staid awhile. It
                                    was evidently as old in news as Grandmother's last and was written in
                                    Frona's usualy style perhaps I should say some improvement on her former
                                    style. A card bearing a picture of a Dutchman smoking, his belly or body being
                                    composed of an immense barrel, which she had labeled "Hancock"
                                    caused great laughter by Uncle Rip and his family. Alvin began to answer her letter
                                    tonight.
                        Monday November 29th
                        I passed a fearful time last night and to-day till five o clock. My jaws were so
                                    nearly closed that very little except fluid could pass between
                                    them. I was fevered and chilly hungry and nauseated, too well to want to be down all
                                    the time, too sick to want to set up long. It had grown very painful to swallow
                                    anything and the inside of my mouth was getting sore acutely so upon the surface.
                                    About dark a vilely rotten fetid-tasted matter squirted into my mouth from the roots
                                    of my old tooth and I spat that stuff out of my mouth more or less steadily for two
                                    hours. I didnt sleep very soundly but better than last night. Father worked at his
                                    cow-stable all day says he expects to be able to "hang the cows"
                                    in a few days. Alvin and Mother washed after which and between which he helped
                                    Father. Riley Nosier was here this morning and paid $30. on his
                                    wife's note.
                        Tuesday, November 30th.
                        I remained quietly in the house all day. I still felt weak and debilitated; so much
                                    so that I could not stay on my feet long at a time. Father and Alvin worked the
                                    livelong [day] preparing the cow-stable. They were nearly done at night but it 
                              
                                 81 Probably Sophronia Van Demark, who was a cousin of
                                            William Gregory and daughter of F. J. Van Demark. See footnote eighty-seven.

                                     was so late that they only got old Peg fastened
                                    in the stancheons for the night—the rest had to wait till morning.
                                    To-day's weather was cloudy, yet tolerably bright, warm but thawed little
                                    and a small sleet and rain began at night which however did'n't
                                    last long.
                        Wednesday December 1st.
                        Nor to-day did I any work. I am strangely weakened, to feel so well, and have had no
                                    more indisposition than that of the past few days. The day was sunshiny and
                                    considerable thawing took place. Father and Alvin put in their time making a huge
                                    door nine feet in width and hung it at the end of the buggy-shed. They then fixed at
                                    things about the cow-barn which will take I should think about four day's
                                    work yet to complete. I went up to the school house on the hill at noon. The
                                    scholars were somewhat rude and boisterous and I not very well so I
                                    did'n't enjoy it very much. Tom Newbern gathered a load of corn
                                    to-day
                        Thursday December 2nd.
                        A clear sunshiny day with some thawing That everlasting cow-barn took up the time of
                                    the other two men of the house almost to the exclusion of everything else. I knocked
                                    around, felt better, and cleaned out the stable a task which as it had been
                                    neglected for two weeks might in one sense of the term be called Herculean
                        Friday, December 3rd.
                        A cloudy tolerably warm day, with a good deal of thaw but it seems to me that there
                                    is nearly as much snow as there was a week ago. We were all fooling around till
                                    nearly noon, I doing not much of anything, the others putting what they called the
                                    finishing touches on the new barn. I cant see it for the loft is to go in yet. Then
                                    Father went down below the Curtis field and cut down a small dead ash that stood by
                                    the side of the road. I went down with the sled and we got it. Then assisted by
                                    Alvin we hauled a load of oak stuff from the tree by the hog-lot gate after which
                                    Alvin and he hauled or "snaked" a couple of logs. By this it was
                                    supper time, and nearly sundown so they only had time to get up a sled-load of
                                    fodder. Stokely Stiles Sr and Tom Newbern gathered the rest of the Charlie Warthen
                                    corn to-day hauling two loads up here and one home. It returned about 85 bushels to
                                    the share according to Stokely's estimate. Alvin finished that letter to
                                    Frona
                        
                        Saturday, December 4th
                        The day opened with heavy fog almost rain. It did begin to rain in real earnest about
                                    noon and was pelting it down at bed-time in soaking style. The snow began to
                                    disappear but ice seemed to take its place in the roads, paths etc. Father and Alvin
                                    were at work putting the loft in the cow-barn. They used up all the lumber around
                                    that was suitable. Between eleven and twelve o'clock we hitched to the hack
                                    and Father started to town. He was back at three. Alvin and I had made wood while he
                                    was gone but had'n't got enough for Sunday when it began raining
                                    so hard we had to quit. We got a letter from Grandmother who had $100
                                    spare cash that she wanted to lend to us at 6% interest which was about
                                    all there was of the letter. The daguerreotype was found at Mt. Vernon.
                        A walk through the cow-barn when the cows are in stanchions makes one think of the
                                    public pillories of the olden time.
                        Sunday, December 5th.
                        The sky though not entirely free from clouds was more or less clear all day, but the
                                    wind blew raw, cold and hard from the north and west, and it got colder all day. I
                                    wandered over nearly to the creek church this forenoon but concluded that everybody
                                    would be a fair weather Christian especially as I saw no signs of vitality, so I
                                    came home again, getting here just as Wat, Em, and the children arrived in the
                                    buggy. They were here till about 4 o'clock, having got here between ten and
                                    eleven. Alvin is grunting around with a small attack of toothache.
                        A year ago at five o clock in the morning Charley died after a night of suffering.
                        Monday, December 6th.
                        The day opened with cold raw wind from the north-west. The sun shone but little. It
                                    began spitting snow about eleven o'clock and kept at it without getting
                                    much on the ground. Nothing of much importance was done Father was fussing around
                                    doing various odd jobs around the new barn. Alvin was helping Mother wash most of
                                    the time and I spent about one-third of the time making wood; the rest of the time
                                    in the house. Bob Foster was here after an auger during the afternoon.
                        
                        Tuesday, December 7th.
                        The same kind of weather as yesterday except that it did'n't begin
                                    to snow till about four o clock when it began to pelt down in good earnest. It was
                                    rather colder than yesterday. Father wrote a short letter to Grandmother and sent
                                    her a note for $100 at 6 per cent signed by Mother and himself
                                    Mother's name being signed first. He went to town a horseback about ten
                                    o'clock and got back about three. Alvin spent some time in the squiz-shop
                                    and he and I made a good deal of firewood during the day.
                        Wednesday, December 8th.
                        The sky was clear the weather cold without much wind, averaging I believe about
                                    20† above zero during the day and sinking to 5† above before 9
                                    o clock in the evening. Alvin spent the greater part of the day in the shop working
                                    at his saw-mill which is going up slowly. Father fussed around at nothing in
                                    particular. He went up to Bob Foster's after dark to recover his augers. He
                                    had old Colonel rough shod on all four feet yesterday. Beyond chopping and splitting
                                    a little wood occasionally to keep "in whack" I did nothing. My
                                    jaws though I can see nothing to hinder will not yet open more than half an inch.
                                    Why is this thusly? Only about an inch of snow at most had fallen but little of if
                                    went off to-day.
                        Thursday, December 9th.
                        Nor did it go off to-day either though the sun shone brightly all day, and the
                                    temperature averaged and varied about as yesterday. Father was gone most of the day
                                    to town. He went to get his other horse shod. He rode one and led the other and
                                    returned about four o'clock with the job done. Alvin devoted all of the
                                    time he could to his squiz, which seems to be going to take up a great part of the
                                    room in the shop. I did as I did yesterday. John Kivett was here awhile this
                                    afternoon. He said he came merely because he had got tired of sitting around home.
                        Friday, December 10th.
                        The weather was very like that of yesterday though it felt a slight degree warmer,
                                    and pleasanter. Father spent all day in making a "bob-sled." He
                                    began it soon after breakfast and the sun had set when it was completed. Alvin
                                    helped him the greater part of the time, though he and I hauled up a sled-load of
                                    fodder and put in the cow-barn, also picked up a lot of the  chip and chunks left around said barn and hauled them
                                    up to the house. They were snowy and somewhat nasty and I rather wonder now why I
                                    hauled them up here.
                        Saturday, December 11th.
                        A good deal warmer but no thawing, cloudy most of the time, and the south wind began
                                    to blow at night. I put those snowy chips in the wood-house. Alvin and Father cut
                                    some logs and after awhile we hitched up first to the old sled and hauled up the top
                                    of the ash tree that the log sled was made of which stood a little distance south of
                                    the stable. Then they hitched to the log sled and hauled the body up. The next to
                                    tackle was a big beech on the hill-side just above the stable which Alvin and I cut
                                    last spring and began to make stovewood of but quit after about using up our
                                    ax-handles. The first log rolled a short distance down hill sled and all. The sled
                                    was then put aside and the two logs were "snaked" down without it,
                                    but not without some danger. It being eleven o clock Father started in the hack to
                                    town and I concluded I would go with him. I was up at Uncle W. R.'s a short
                                    time and was charged with a bundle for Effie to be left at Wat's. I brought
                                    it down and put it in our butter-pail before starting out. Mr. Cunningham82 thought it belonged to one of his clerks so Father left it
                                    and we started home. I happened to find out it was not in the pail after I was some
                                    distance out. I hoofed back, got the bundle, and came out in Aleck
                                        Stiles's83 wagon in company with five others. Got
                                    home at 3.30 o'clock. I broke the mainspring of my watch while winding it
                                    at night. Alvin divided his time between firewood and squiz while we were gone and
                                    we made a lot of wood after I got home.
                        Sunday, December 12th.
                        A great deal warmer so much so that the slight amount of snow went off in favorable
                                    places a thin spatter of mud took its place. It began a slight drizzling rain at
                                    noon and kept at it till after dark. Alvin took a jook in the forenoon; got as far
                                    as Stoke Stiles's and recovered the "go-devil" or
                                    post-auger. I footed it up to Crone's church where Jim Holmes's

                                     school was in full blast with a large
                                    attendance both of scholars and spectators. The order was such that he requested a
                                    better quality once. I came home and staid there. No further noteworthy incidents
                                    occurred
                        Monday, December 13th.
                        The sun shone part of the time and the slow thaw continued though it froze slightly
                                    last night. We put in the day from seven o clock (nearly) till night, gathering corn
                                    in Cal Curtis s contract. We got in about 70 bushels, one load without the
                                    side-boards on one with them on, and about 25 bushels in the afternoon. The yield is
                                    about half what it usually is. John Kivett came down where we were a few moments in
                                    the afternoon, errand if he had any not made known. Will Bain84
                                    was down a few moments after school to inform me of his proposed spelling match
                                    tomorrow night
                        Tuesday, December 14th.
                        A mild spring-like day, clear and nice overhead; muddy under foot. We finished the
                                    Curtis field our part of it I mean getting hardly 10 bushels then filled up the
                                    wagon in the creek end of the field below the rye-patch (now Bill Hand's
                                    wheat-field). As we made many turns it was noon when we got to the house. After
                                    dinner we got another load from the shortest rows on the "horse's
                                    head" and got up here in time to haul up a load of fodder. Will Bain sent
                                    me a note by John Foster requesting me to bring my test speller when I came to the
                                    match. Riley Nosier came after the sausage-mill about sundown. The
                                    "spellin" drew a good crowd of youngsters who had lots of fun. At
                                    the first round I came out first best through George Pearce85
                                    missing "italisize". The second time Will Bain and I both
                                    misspelled "cannonade" I through inattention and sleepiness. Drawn
                                    battle. Recess came and it was a long one in which a couple of kissing games were
                                    all the rage. All but a few in which few I was included took part in them. After
                                    recess I "gave out" and Pearce came out ahead. There was no use
                                    for the test speller as the expected champions did not appear. I was in bed by ten o
                                    clock.

                        Wednesday, December 15th.
                        A good deal of a freeze last night and not very much of a thaw to-day. The sun only
                                    shone a short time. The high ridges made by the old Dudley plow86 last summer being frozen made it fearfully rough. We gathered perhaps 60
                                    bushels of corn to-day, going three times after it. We went four times the entire
                                    length of the field below the "rye-patch" striking it a little
                                    west of the middle and gathering toward Fowler's line. We got up with about
                                    22 bushels in the wagon at two o'clock, ate dinner, and went back getting
                                    ten bushels more. The yield was very good in quantity, superb in quality.
                        Thursday December 16th.
                        Considerable of a freeze last night but no frost. It was some cooler all day then
                                    yesterday the sun did'n't shine much and a north wind blew part of
                                    the time. We got into the field a half-hour earlier this morning and got two full
                                    loads with the side boards on and ten bushels besides, finishing next to
                                    Fowler's and beginning on the eastern part of the field south of Bill
                                    Hand's wheat Mother washed by herself or without any help to-day, a thing
                                    which she has not done in a good while. There is a good deal of complaint about sore
                                    hands, feet, heads, bellies, and backs.
                        Friday, December 17th.
                        Cloudy and threatening this morning. We started out as early as yesterday to-gather
                                    corn and got one five rows gathered across the field when it began to rain pretty
                                    hard and freeze as it fell. We were obliged to quit for the day. Father and Alvin
                                    went to giving the buckwheat another cleaning. I sat in the house till after two
                                    o'clock when I hitched to the hack and went over to Loper's
                                    school-house after Effie. I drove up and interviewed Cal Curtis awhile before
                                    starting back. The road from the creek to Fowler's was icy, the creek
                                    itself had shelves of ice on each side and a zig-zag course
                                    between sides through the ice. But we got back safely without breaking anything. The
                                    singletree hook broken the 19th of November was replaced by a new one to-day. It did
                                    not rain all the time nor very much after noon.

                        Saturday, December 18th.
                        It continued cloudy, till noon when the sun came out and it thawed till night. Bob
                                    Foster and John Kivett came shortly after breakfast Bob to go to town, John to see
                                    about his canned fruit. He took three of his cans and soon started home with them.
                                    Bob and Father went to town in the hack. I made wood for two or three hours with
                                    Alvin helping part of the time. Father got back about three o'clock;
                                    brought Effie's parcel which I left at Wat's last Saturday and a
                                    line from F.J. Van-Demark87 inclosing money orders for the
                                    $100 which Grandmother was to lend us. Father paid it on the farm debt.
                                    After he got home Alvin and I hauled up a sled-load of fodder. The visitor was the
                                    most industrious one about the house except Mother. My old tooth was growling
                                    slightly and I took two or three "yaller powders" Alvin I believe
                                    fanned out the rest of the buckwheat. Uncle Rip sent Effie her candy to treat her
                                    scholars with.
                        Sunday, December 19th.
                        The day was cloudy and cold and ice covered a great part of the "outside
                                    world." I have forgotten to state that a light snow was on the ground
                                    yesterday morning. It did not thaw any to-day. The Rev. Runyan preached on the creek
                                    to-day and I heard one of his strictly Campbellite sermons preached to about a house
                                    full He made the rather sweeping assertion that the Christ could or would not save
                                    Christians but would condemn them at the day of judgment if they remained divided
                                    into sects till then. I came home and about three o clock took Effie back to or
                                    nearly to Mrs Allen's in the hack Symptoms of another "jawing
                                    spell" began to be felt in my face. My tooth hurt and there was some
                                    swelling. One of our young pigs was killed last night, apparently by a cow and we
                                    were favored to night with a visitation from two strange cats a
                                    "yaller" and a gray and white one.
                        Monday, December 20th.
                        It was snowing when we got up and kept at it slowly nearly all day but
                                    was'n't an inch deep at night. Alvin was in the squiz shop the
                                    greater part of the time making so-called improvements on his fanning-mill. He and I
                                    sawed up one of 
                              
                                 87 Flavius Josephus Van Demark, born February 18,
                                            1844, was William Gregory's mother's half-brother. See
                                            footnote twenty. Charles Harrison, "Family Record."
                           
                                     the logs hauled Dec. 11th and I split it up,
                                    which was about all I did. Cal Curtis got his last jag of corn out of the field this
                                    forenoon and our cows were very soon let on the stalks. Father tinkered around at
                                    various jobs during the day.
                        Tuesday, December 21st
                        A cloudy day with the thermometer just about the freezing point so that very little
                                    freezing was done or thawing either. Father took part of the buckwheat and six sacks
                                    of corn and went up to High Rocks Mills with it getting back about three
                                    o'clock. I built up the fence again at the corner of Bill Hand's
                                    wheat which Alvin took out last spring, and I let the calves into the stalks but not
                                    where the cows were. It seems that Alvin did not get the buckwheat done Saturday as
                                    he was at it again to-day. I tinkered around at various other things, and Alvin was
                                    in the squiz-shop part of the time.
                        May and Henry Garrison brought home the sausage-mill which Riley borrowed a week ago
                                    They came at about seven o clock in the evening, and staid about an hour.
                        Wednesday December 22nd
                        The clouds threatened snow or rain every minute all day and made the day dark and
                                    gloomy. Alfred Kivett was here a short time in the morning. His object if I
                                    understood it correctly was to chop wood for pay in other words to be hired to cut
                                    some. After about an hour's waiting for it to storm we hitched to the wagon
                                    and got what corn remained in the field south of Bill Hand's wheat. We got
                                    first about 16 bushels of husked corn and "nubbins" which we put
                                    in the crib. We then got the remainder of the field which consisted mainly of
                                    "nubbins" pulling if off in the husk and putting it on the floor
                                    of the cow-barn. After a short council in which Alvin somewhat bitterly opposed
                                    gathering any more, Father was indifferent, and I earnestly in favor of continuing,
                                    we finally went down into the field across the creek or the
                                    "clover-patch" This was planted in "Bloody
                                    Butcher" or Michigan corn and gave a small yield so that though we were
                                    there nearly 3 hours we only got about 20 bushels making a days' gathering
                                    of about 40 bushels. The last piece of a load we put in the old crib. The ground
                                    over there is very rough. The first buckwheat cakes were eaten
                                    this morning.
                        Thursday December 23rd.
                        It began snowing this morning and kept at it nearly all the time till night without
                                    getting over an inch more on the  ground. Father
                                    made two ax-handles and tinkered around, Alvin helped Mother wash and helped me make
                                    some firewood, besides also some squizzing and I fussed about without getting much
                                    done as is usually the case on such days. The thermometer stood at 34†
                                    above zero on an average. Jake brought Alvin's kraut-cutter home this
                                    afternoon but did'n't stay long.
                        Friday December 24th.
                        The sun peeped forth dimly a few times but the day was cloudy though not very cold.
                                    Bill Hand came while we were at breakfast. He took a sackful of his wheat or rather
                                    it was taken for him as Father went across the creek and got a wagon-load of wood.
                                    He hauled 3 loads of Ballinger wood from across the creek while I stowed it away and
                                    assisted by Alvin manufactured the last of the logs hauled last Saturday week. He
                                    then went down and cut two trees on the other bank of the creek a sugar-tree and a
                                    beech. I hauled three logs from those trees to the house with the log sled. Then
                                    came supper after which Alvin and I hauled up the tops of the aforementioned trees
                                    and lastly another "drag" was brought up by Father and myself
                                    completing the job as far as to-day is con[c]erned.
                        Saturday, December 25th
                        It began snowing this morning and kept at it till about three o'clock when
                                    it quit and by eight o clock was clear. It was'n't more than a
                                    half inch deeper when it quit. Father and I started to town in the hack taking;
                                    first a wooden cross made a long time ago by Alvin for Effie; a lot of nuts for the
                                    girls; and lastly a box containing the strange "yaller" cat that
                                    came last Sunday.; It was let out between Amos Hart's and town.88 I ate dinner at Uncle Rip's having gone up there
                                    after I thought dinner was over. I bought a copy of the Scientific American and one
                                    of the American Agriculturist for Alvin; also a pair of gum boots at the store for
                                    myself. We got home by 3.30 o'clock. I have omitted to state that I wrote a
                                    letter to Grandmother last night. It was sent to-day. It was not a very busy day in
                                    town.
                        Sunday, December 26th.
                        A rather disappointing Sunday. It was a continuation of the same everlasting cloudy
                                    weather but it did not storm today. I went down to Wat's, soon after
                                    breakfast. I found him at 
                              
                                 88 Probably the home of Amos S. Hart of Washington

                                     home but alone. He was obliged to go to town
                                    for his wife and babies who had staid over last night. I came back home and kept
                                    myself there. Alvin has what appears to be a case of the
                                    "epizoot." No other noteworthy incident occurred here, I believe,
                                    to day.
                        Monday, December 27th
                        It snowed in flurries occasionally during the forenoon and continued gray and cloudy
                                    till night when it cleared. A piercing wind set in this morning and by night the
                                    thermometer stood at only 12† above zero. The weather report will make
                                    the most of to-day's record. Alvin squizzed more or less through the day. I
                                    fooled around not doing much of anything. Father wrote a statement of the dates,
                                    indorsements, etc. on Mrs Garrison's now Mrs Riley Nosler's note
                                    of Nov. 18 1876 and went over in that neighborhood to take it to her. He visited at
                                    Kivett's and I know not where else before he got back which was about two
                                    o'clock.
                        Tuesday, December 28th
                        The mercury stood about at zero all day and the snow fell sometimes fast sometimes
                                    not so fast till night when it became nearly clear about nine o'clock. The
                                    snow was perhaps an inch deeper or about three inches, not more on the level, in
                                    all. Father did nothing besides the chores and sitting in the house. I chopped wood
                                    occasionally to keep in whack. Alvin tried to squiz but it was rather cold. John
                                    Kivett was here this forenoon to borrow the sausage-grinder. It was discovered to be
                                    broken but he took it all the same. It will probably never return here whole; as it
                                    left.
                        Wednesday, December 29th
                        14† below zero at sunrise this morning and about zero all day on the
                                    porch. A very cutting wind came from the northwest and it was very cold. The sun
                                    shone in the middle of the day but clouds drove over all the time and frost flew in
                                    clouds in the evening mingled with snow. Nothing was done except cutting some wood,
                                    and the chores except that I began a letter to Dwight Calhoun.89
                                    It was too cold to squiz or go away from home
                        
                           
                              89 Dwight Calhoun was a distant cousin of William Gregory.
                                        Dwight's mother, Lucy Hitchcock, was one of William Gregory's
                                        mother's aunts. Charles Harrison, "Family
                                    Record."
                        
                        
                        Thursday, December 30th
                        And it was the same way to-day. The mercury only fell to 7† below zero
                                    last night or rather stood at that this morning. The air was filled with flying
                                    frost, creating some beautifully bright "sun-dogs" as the sun
                                    arose. They were nearly as bright as rainbows. It averaged 8† above zero
                                    all day; the wind did not blow and the sun shone most of the time. The same things
                                    that occupied us yesterday occupied us to-day except that I
                                    did'n't write any in that letter and Alvin tried to squiz rather
                                    more but it was rather coolish for him even.
                        Friday December 31st
                        A clear cold day followed by a clear, calm cold night. The mercury indicated 16
                                    degrees below zero at sunrise. The eclipse was'n't thought of or
                                    seen. About 12 degrees above zero was the average for the day. There was a little
                                    change in the monotonous round: Mother and Alvin devoted part of the day to the
                                    cleansing of the dirty duds etc. of the household. At noon I went up to the
                                    school-house on the hill but found neither teacher nor pupils and concluded that
                                    Will's school was frozen out or adjourned till warmer weather. I also
                                    passed considerable time manufacturing firewood and was assisted by Alvin to some
                                    extent. Father staid quietly around. I burnt up the letter I had begun to Dwight
                                    Calhoun as it did not suit me.
                        So the record is closed for the year 1880. It is a history that notwithstanding the
                                    obscure lives of its personages, might have been written so as to have been more
                                    interesting. It will sufficiently repay the writer if these chronicles are ever of
                                    interest or use to any one. And any readers are requested to remember that written

               A Documentary History of the Indiana, Decade of the Harmony Society,
                        1814–1824. Volume II, 1820–1824. Compiled and
                    edited by Karl J. R. Arndt. (Indianapolis: Indiana Historical Society, 1978. Pp. xiii, 978. Notes,
                    illustrations, index. Clothbound, $17.50; paperbound, $8.00.)
            The letters and documents in the second volume portray the problems as well as the more pleasant
                    aspects relating to the Harmony Society during its last five years in Indiana. The Harmonist system
                    of communal living and adherence to religious beliefs had been established. They were hard-working
                    Germans, and each member made his contribution for the good of the Society by the manner in which he
                    executed the specific task assigned to him. As a result, prosperity and wealth followed which
                    encouraged them to develop manufacturing. Their frugality, hardheadedness, and resourcefulness led
                    from a common farm economy to an early industrial society. They engaged in farming, flour milling,
                    processing farm products, cotton spinning, weaving cloth, making wine, brickmaking, and numerous
                    other industries.
            Jonathan Jennings, governor of Indiana, supported home manufacture and wore Society-made cloth.
                    Likewise, William Henry Harrison ordered cloth and wool from the Harmonists. Frederick Rapp pleaded
                    for a high tariff to protect domestic manufactures and the American farmer. He also requested a
                    remedy for the poor mail service to which the postmaster general responded.
            Frederick Rapp took an active part in politics and was well-known by politicians. There are numerous
                    letters from office seekers soliciting Harmonists' votes. Ratliff Boon was quite concerned
                    when he learned they were supporting one of his opponents and requested them not to cast their
                    votes.
            The Society had markets for their wares and produce in Pittsburgh, Boston, Louisville, New Orleans,
                    and St. Louis. In addition they operated stores in Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky. Several times
                    they took Arabian horses, leather, calf hides, and barrels of timothy and clover seed in partial
                    payment of a debt.
            Apparently the Society always had funds as Jonathan Jennings wrote for a thousand-dollar loan with
                    interest at 10 percent, which was not granted. A year later Samuel Merrill,  state treasurer, was able to negotiate a loan of five thousand dollars
                    with interest at 6 percent.
            There are a number of letters inquiring about membership in the Society and seeking information on
                    the religious foundation and organization of the Harmonists. They enjoyed friendly relationships
                    with the Shakers. In 1820 Robert Owen wrote to George Rapp also desiring data on the Society.
                    Unfortunately, Rapp's reply has not been located.
            In February, 1824, three Harmonists left Indiana in search of a new location which was found in
                    western Pennsylvania. A town was started, and crops were planted. A journal of the tour was kept.
                    When Richard Flower left for Philadelphia the following month, he spread the word that Harmony was
                    to be sold. A letter from Frederick Rapp gave the terms of the sale and his intentions to advertise
                    in England and the eastern states. The advertisement gives a glowing account of the
                    twenty-thousand-acre estate.
            Isaac and Willis Stewart of Louisville engaged the Plough Boy for eleven hundred dollars to transport
                    the Society from Indiana to Economy, Pennsylvania. On May 24, 1824, the Plough Boy
                    began its voyage down the Wabash. Among the documents is the log of the Plough
                    Boy, May 24 to June 6, 1824.
            This is a fascinating volume one can read for pleasure. One need not be a Hoosier to enjoy the
                    letters and documents of the Harmony Society. Professor Karl Arndt is to be congratulated for having
                    undertaken such a monumental task. Much of the fine editing, good index, annotations, and cross
                    references is due to the patience and untiring efforts of Lana Ruegmar. A bibliography would have
                    been helpful.

               Joseph Neef: The Americanization of Pestalozzianism. By Gerald Lee Gutek.
                    (University: The University of Alabama Press, 1978. Pp. viii, 159. Notes, bibliography, index.
                    $10.75.)
            Suggestive of recent developments in educational practice and criticism, this study deserves
                    attention from social historians and others interested in pedagogy and the use of education for
                    purposes of social reform. Part one provides a biographical survey of Joseph Neef
                    (1770–1854), French emigrant and pioneer American educational reformer. Part two
                    elucidates in  detail the elements of his pedagogical theory and
                    method. The subdivision of each chapter into distinct topics makes the book a useful reference tool,
                    but while the writing is prudent and bright, such organization does encourage excessive repetition.
            The presence of Johann Pestalozzi, the famed Swiss educator, and William Maclure, a neglected
                    education enthusiast and social reformer, pervaded Neef s life as an educator. Inspired by
                    Rousseau's romantic naturalism and by his attention to the psychology and dignity of
                    childhood, Pestalozzi fashioned an eclectic educational philosophy that prescribed an environment of
                    emotional security, in contrast to the practice of corporal punishment then current in European and
                    American schools, and a method based on sensationalism, which rejected reliance on literary
                    instruction and learning by rote. After serving in Napoleon's army in the Italian campaign,
                    Neef trained under Pestalozzi at his school in Burgdorf, Switzerland. In 1806, Maclure persuaded
                    Neef, now the disciple, to disseminate Pestalozzianism in America in the hope that it eventually
                    would liberate the working class from its chains. After directing schools in Pennsylvania and
                    Kentucky, a discouraged Neef turned to farming until he accepted Maclure's invitation to
                    join Robert Owen's short-lived communitarian experiment at New Harmony. While clouded by
                    disputes among the Owenites, Neefs career in educational reform culminated there in 1827, the year
                    coincidentally of Pestalozzi's death.
            Gerald Lee Gutek, an authority on Pestalozzi and an author of several books in educational history,
                    agrees with earlier writers that Neefs mission had little influence on American institutional
                    development. Still, he is correct in calling for a reassessment of Neefs work, which foreshadowed
                    some of the ideas in the progressive education movement and the thought of social-reconstructionist
                    educators. In contrast to previous interpreters, the author stresses that Neef was more than merely
                    "the lengthened shadow" of Pestalozzi in America. True, under the spell of
                    Enlightenment philosophes, Neef, the rationalist, eschewed Rousseau's
                    conception of the child as "noble savage"; animated by "Liberty,
                    Equality, and Fraternity," Neef, the republican, repudiated Pestalozzi's
                    paternalism. But to what extent did his alteration of the master's teaching represent
                    Americanization?
            The author has mined dexterously the ideas buried in Neefs Sketch of a Plan and Method
                        of Education (1808) and has examined the pertinent papers in the Illinois Historical  Survey and in the Workingmen's Institute at New
                    Harmony. Unfortunately the paucity of primary documents leaves such matters as the relationship
                    between Neefs thought and the republicanism of his adopted land tantalizingly uncertain.
                    Consequently, such an assertion, as in the chapter on ethical theory, that Neef "adapted
                    quickly to the egalitarianism of the Indiana and Kentucky frontier" (p. 123) must rely on a
                    largely uncritical acceptance of the frontier hypothesis and tends to exaggerate the differences
                    between Pestalozzi and Neef. Perhaps this "backwoodsman's" toil and
                    retirement at New Harmony reflected his disillusionment with the American republic. Neef spent his
                    last twenty years at New Harmony watching sunsets—if we can believe his
                    great-granddaughter—with no significant followers to carry on his work.

               Indiana University: Midwestern Pioneer. Vol. III, Years of
                        Fulfillment. By Thomas D. Clark. (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1977. Pp. xxii,
                    678. Illustrations, bibliography, index. $19.95.)
            This volume is the last of three large ones carefully delineating the part played by Indiana
                    University as "a Midwestern Pioneer" in the development of higher education.
                    Thomas D. Clark's work is truly monumental, even as it uses elaborate detail in its
                    thoroughness.
            Hoosiers as late as the early twentieth century seem to have been content with a state university of
                    acceptability in Indiana circles. David Starr Jordan, elected president in 1884, and William L.
                    Bryan, who later served as president for three and one half decades, had emphasized good teaching
                    rather than research. Perhaps the times were not yet ripe for an effort to secure a reputation for
                    sophisticated scholarship or for efforts to forge ahead in an imaginative way to assume intellectual
                    leadership.
            The tremendous changes in Indiana University over the last four decades involved expenditures beyond
                    the imagination of earlier presidents. This was especially noteworthy after 1935 when New Deal and
                    World War II programs poured millions of dollars worth of materials into university coffers. An
                    increased emphasis on research meant larger sums for private scientific efforts along with state and
                    federal projects. Elaborate  new buildings included a wide
                    variety of student housing projects, extensive efforts to serve the theater, diversified
                    laboratories to fill research needs, and classrooms, libraries, and other edifices which were the
                    results of extensive planning.
            The long established projects of Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey, dealing with male and female sexuality,
                    received thorough-going support from President Herman B Wells, a situation which would not have been
                    possible even a short time before. In a period of conflicting ideologies, great differences of
                    opinion existed in the state and the university as to the extent to which communism had acquired a
                    foothold in the United States. Similar discussion concerned itself with the influence of Naziism.
                    The belief of many that communism and Hitlerism should receive the same treatment in a functioning
                    democracy startled even some exponents of free speech.
            Wide attention to many of the new academic developments expressed itself in the struggle for
                    curriculum reform and in the fight for beauty and utility in building construction. Likewise there
                    was determined effort for improvement in administrative procedures, in abounding efforts to secure
                    athletic distinction, in the development of radio and television excellence, and in participation in
                    the newly emerging nuclear age. Sometimes cultured progress seemed to be sidetracked by an emphasis
                    on pragmatic concerns, but here too there was phenomenal support for changing viewpoints. In no
                    place was this more evident than when the Metropolitan Grand Opera Company made its annual
                    appearance, supplementing a local auditorium series of real distinction.
            All in all the book is a remarkable social and intellectual history of Indiana University,
                    1938–1969.

            Throughout the nation the bicentennial celebrations provided both the occasion and the funding for
                    projects of a commemorative nature. Accordingly many new tomes have appeared on the local history
                    sections of library shelves. Wisconsin, despite—or perhaps because of—its
                    reputation for being one of the most thoroughly researched states, has not been slow to sponsor
                    volumes of various kinds. Racine: Growth and Change in a Wisconsin County and Woodlot
                        and Ballot Box: Marathon County in the Twentieth Century are two such local projects from
                    two contrasting areas of "America's Dairyland."
            Racine County, located in the southeastern quadrant of Wisconsin, was an agricultural region in its
                    early years, but since the 1880s it has been part of the urban-industrial, lake-shore corridor. In
                    an attempt to give full play to human and political diversity as well as to economic development,
                    ten local scholars were each asked to contribute a section on the county. Subjects range from
                    geography and agriculture, through industry and business to politics and government, religion,
                    education, and culture, the immigrant heritage, Indians and early white settlement, organized labor,
                    and the community in war. In the long-hallowed tradition of county histories this volume aims to be
                    both a reference tool for much of Racine's past and a topical history which any reader can
                    pick up and enjoy at any point. The reference aspect is readily visible both in style and content,
                    and it is buttressed by a useful statistical appendix. The text is also easy to scan, but its
                    enjoyment is marred by an uneven quality. Some parts match the solid Wisconsin standard of
                    scholarship, but others indicate only a half-hearted interest in and commitment to the subject under
                    discussion. Perhaps the authors were asked to span too long a period in such a short space. Given
                    the existence of other Racine County histories penned by an earlier generation, it might have been
                    more useful to concentrate on the present century, which has certainly produced a myriad of
                    interesting phenomena worthy of detailed attention.
            Such a decision was indeed taken by the coauthors of Woodlot and Ballot Box. Howard
                    R. Klueter and James J. Lorence set out to narrate the economic and political history of Marathon
                    County in the twentieth century. Located in the northcentral part of Wisconsin this
                    county's early development focused on the exploitation of abundant timber resources. Once
                    this lumbering heritage has been discussed, the shape of the modern economy gradually emerges in the
                    form of wood-using industries, especially paper, and then more recently with newer  manufacturing groups like metalwork. The contribution of the
                    agricultural sector also receives well-deserved attention. Political events in this populous
                    heartland region have followed a complex course. Progressive and liberal tendencies were and are
                    offset by an underlying conservatism, and economic upturns and downswings have competed with
                    ethnocultural ties in election issues at both the local and state level. Information on
                    twentieth-century Marathon County is certainly abundant, but its presentation could be improved. It
                    is difficult to understand why more attention has been directed to the economy and to the earlier
                    years of this century. But more disturbing than the lopsided treatment is the dense style. The
                    authors seem reluctant to depart far from their primary and secondary sources. Further refinement of
                    evidence would make for easier reading, especially for a general audience. The book is more likely
                    aimed at eager Marathon residents. Doubtless that small band of academics who seem to make a career
                    out of knowing all about Wisconsin will also peruse this and the Racine volume, but few others will
                    take the time to delve into the nitty-gritty of local history. These bicentennial books are
                    certainly worthy of note, but they will have limited impact.

               A Kentucky Sampler: Essays from The Filson Club History Quarterly, 1926–1976. Edited by Lowell Harrison and Nelson L. Dawson. (Lexington: The
                    University Press of Kentucky, 1977. Pp. 446. Notes, map, illustrations. $12.50.)
            A private society in Louisville dedicated to the collection of Kentucky history, the Filson Club has
                    been in existence for nearly one hundred years and its journal, the Filson Club History
                        Quarterly, for slightly more than fifty years. To commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of
                    the Quarterly, Lowell Harrison, professor of history at Western Kentucky
                    University, and Nelson L. Dawson, editor of the Quarterly, present twenty-eight
                    articles from the approximately eight hundred published since 1926. Striving for chronological
                    balance and topical diversity, the editors have divided Kentucky's history into five
                    periods: the pioneer era, the antebellum years, the Civil War, the late nineteenth century, and the
                    twentieth century. From four to seven essays `comprise each period.
            Predictably some articles are better than others. Particularly impressive are Thomas D.
                    Clark's "The Slavery Background  of
                    Foster's My Old Kentucky Home," which not only puts the famous song into its
                    historical context, but also speculates about specific influences on the songwriter himself; Nancy
                    D. Baird's scholarly analysis of the impact of cholera on antebellum Kentucky; Nicholas C.
                    Burckel's summary of William Goebel and railroad regulation; and Robert J.
                    Leupold's study of the impact of the Works Progress Administration on the gubernatorial
                    campaign of 1935. Likewise of special note are Charles G. Talbert's account of the British
                    and Indian War of 1781–1783; Lowell Harrison's summary of Cassius Clay and the
                        True American; Louis Hartz' study of John Mashall Harlan's
                    pre-Supreme Court years; and Joseph F. Wall's revisionist interpretation of Henry Watterson
                    and the presidential election of 1876.
            Other articles concern Indian place names, an early history of Bullitt's Lick, the notorious
                    Harpes, the code duello, antebellum milksickness, General James Taylor and the beginnings of
                    Newport, the Indiana-Ohio raid of John Hunt Morgan, Quantrill's bushwhackers, Louisville
                    during the first year of the Civil War, Civil War Shakers, Frank Wolford, the Louisville and
                    Nashville Railroad during the Civil War, some background of constitutional revision in
                    1890–1891, Louisville's labor disturbance of 1877, Stoney Point, the
                    BancoKentucky story, the night riders of 1907, best selling women authors, Paul Sawyier, and
                    folklore.
            Mostly anecdotal rather than broadly interpretative in nature, these essays will appeal more to
                    historical buffs than scholars—eleven of the articles were initially presented as
                    after-dinner papers to the Filson Club. In their introduction the editors note that for the first
                    three years of its existence the Quarterly enjoyed an editorial board, an
                    institution inexplicably abandoned in 1929. Since most academic institutions only reward faculty for
                    articles published in refereed journals, the Quarterly would be well-advised to
                    revive its editorial board. So doing, its centennial anthology will be of even higher quality.

               An Emerging Entertainment: The Drama of the American People to 1828. By Walter
                    J. Meserve. (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1977. Pp. x, 342. Notes, selected bibliography,
                    indexes. $17.50.)
            Unfortunately, few scholars have shown much interest in American drama prior to World War I. For all
                    too many students  of American culture, the history of this art
                    form does not begin until the work of a playwright such as Eugene O'Neill because,
                    supposedly, he alone had the rare ability to create drama that sprang from truly indigenous roots.
                    Walter J. Meserve, a professor of theater and drama at Indiana University, takes issue with this
                    academic myopia. In An Emerging Entertainment, he argues a convincing case for the
                    significance of American drama in its early centuries, specifically up to 1828—the year
                    that marks the beginning of Edwin Forrest's Prize Play Contests (advertized in the New York
                        Critic), the first time that American playwrights were invited to contribute
                    plays in a competition and promised to be remunerated for their achievements.
            In his opening chapter, Meserve outlines his objectives for his study of this long neglected aspect
                    of American history; they are fourfold: a) to provide a chronological study and critical evaluation
                    of the plays written and published in America to 1828; b) to explore the kinds of drama written
                    during particular periods and the relationship of drama to the cultural and historical progress of
                    the country; c) to provide biographical material on important dramatists and historical information
                    on relevant plays; and, d) to determine the development of American drama as a literary genre and
                    its contribution to American theater. In the main, Meserve succeeds in his multi-purpose task, and
                    his book fills a gap in our understanding of the American creative arts.
            Carefully distinguishing himself as a historian of the drama as opposed to a historian of the
                    theater, Meserve provides an intellectual history of early America through the prism of Indian
                    treaty ceremonies (dramatic enactments that were often printed), farces, melodramas, and ephemeral
                    plays. He acknowledges the benchmarks of early American drama—Robert Hunter's
                        Androborus (the first play printed in America, in 1714); Thomas
                    Godfrey's The Prince of Parthia (the first drama written by an American
                    and produced by professional actors, in 1767); Royall Tyler's The
                    Contrast (the first native American comedy to be professionally produced, in
                    1789)—but does not overemphasize or distort their impact. Instead, like the
                    "new" social historians, Meserve explores American dramatic art as a medium
                    through which educational, religious, and cultural history can be written. In his discussion of
                    early American dramatic literary criticism (the first extended analysis that this reviewer has seen
                    in recent scholarship), he moves  comfortably among eighteenth-
                    and early nineteenth-century theories of aesthetics and epistemology.
            Although this history of American drama ranges over 230 years of the American past, the book
                    concentrates on the brief era of the New Republic. Meserve focuses his interpretation on the five
                    decades between 1787 and 1828. Chapters seven and eight, for example, form the bulk (128 pages) of
                    his evaluation and insightfully trace the rise of nationalism and political ideology as exhibited in
                    various American dramatic genre.
            Meserve's book also serves as a major reference work on American drama. It has two excellent
                    indexes, one of names and the other of plays, and an extremely thorough bibliography. Moreover, the
                    book is but the first installment of a complete, scholarly, and authoritative historical assessment
                    of American drama that Meserve now projects in several volumes.

               The Wolf by the Ears: Thomas Jefferson and Slavery. By John Chester Miller. (New
                    York: The Free Press, 1977. Pp. xii, 319. Illustrations, notes, bibliography, index.
                    $12.95.)
            Why another book on Jefferson and slavery? Winthrop Jordan has investigated Jefferson's
                    presuppositions, Fawn Brodie has questioned Jefferson's sexual behavior, and Robert
                    McColley has examined slavery in Jeffersonian Virginia. What remains? For John Chester Miller the
                    unfinished task is to explain how Jefferson consciously dealt with the disparity between his
                    preachments and practices. Miller's question is important. How could Jefferson proclaim
                    human rights to a candid world while he owned slaves and even promoted slavery in later years?
                    Miller's answer is disturbing: Jefferson concealed his prejudice from himself by denying
                    the dignity and abilities of blacks and by ignoring slavery's debilitating effects on its
                    principal victims. For example, since Jefferson could not endure the thought of enslaved men and
                    women of letters, he readily responded to black intellectual achievements with "scepticism
                    or open incredulity" (p. 77).
            Apparently, Miller is even more intrigued by slavery's impact on Jefferson and his politics.
                    For Miller, Jefferson's defense of slavery had ironic effects. He adopted the substances of
                    Federalist policy toward Toussaint L'Ouverture, purchased the Louisiana territory for
                    yeoman farmers (although its fresh lands reinvigorated the peculiar institution), and abolished the
                         slave trade (reserving slave exportation to Maryland and
                    Virginia and giving each even more reason to perpetuate slavery).
            Following his retirement from political office, Jefferson's defense of slavery led him to
                    discard his earlier beliefs. He advocated "man-made, legal forms" over
                    "natural rights" (p. 230), incipient capitalists (investing in lands and slaves)
                    over the "freedom-loving yeoman farmer" (p. 236), the South "at the
                    expense of his reputation as an opponent of slavery" (p. 250), and the rights of states
                    over individuals. He even "helped kill the things he loved—free speech, a free
                    press, and the unfettered freedom of the human mind, in the sphere that really mattered to him:
                    political theory" (p. 263).
            By this point, Miller's purpose in focusing on one aspect of Jefferson's life in
                    contrast to his earlier full biography of Hamilton becomes evident. Slavery greatly affected
                    Jefferson's world view, leading him to contradict earlier political positions and even to
                    absurd and repulsive stances. For example, in the 1790s Jefferson proposed to prohibit all holders
                    of government securities and bank stocks from sitting in Congress. By excluding slaveowners from
                    this morality test, he impled that owning human beings was less reprehensible than owning stocks and
                    bonds. Although informative, such observations are limited. By focusing only on the peculiar
                    institution, Miller cannot assess slavery's impact on Jefferson relative to other factors
                    and forces. Necessarily, Miller's Jefferson unfairly appears to be dominated by slavery.
            In the case of the Sally Hemings story, Miller shifts from paradox and irony to denial. His dismissal
                    is at odds with his pronounced methodology. Although Miller earlier judged Jefferson by his deeds
                    rather than by his words (as Jefferson requested), he now assesses Jefferson's alleged
                    sexual involvement both by his words and his deeds—and for good reason. The tale, for
                    Miller, is in "utter defiance of the testimony he bore over the course of a long lifetime
                    of the primacy of the moral sense and his loathing of racial mixture" (p. 176).
                    Jefferson's ability to resist the willing and tantalizing Maria Cosway confirms his
                    capacity to deny temptation. Only once, as a young bachelor (well before Sally's time) did
                    Jefferson attempt to seduce any woman (Mrs. Walker). In the face of Fawn Brodie's
                    circumstantial and conjectural evidence, Miller is arguing that exceptional behavior proves the rule
                    and that Jefferson could not have lived a lie, not even to himself.
            
            Because he focuses on deeds rather than words, Miller did not feel the need to explore fresh
                    manuscript sources and instead relies heavily upon standard secondary works. Despite the absence of
                    new information and the author's "episodic" (p. xii) format of thirty-two
                    brief chapters, precluding the development of a unified argument, Miller's book
                    nevertheless remains a convincing and at times moving volume. It moves one to despair by effectively
                    showing how even the best of principles can be corrupted by self-interest and by political
                    realities. As Jefferson described the conundrum in 1820, "'We have the wolf by the
                    ears … and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and
                    self-preservation in the other'" (p. 241).

               Keeping the Faith: A. Philip Randolph, Milton P. Webster, and the Brotherhood of
                        Sleeping Car Porters, 1925–37. By William H. Harris. (Urbana: University of
                    Illinois Press, 1977. Pp. xiv, 252. Notes, tables, appendix, note on sources, index.
                    $12.50.)
            
               Keeping the Faith is an example of institutional labor history at its best. It is
                    not, therefore, about sleeping car porters, but about their union and its leadership. Thoroughly
                    researched, tightly analytical, well-balanced, and thoughtful, it provides an intricate account of
                    the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP) from its birth in 1925 to its recognition as the sole
                    bargaining agent for the Pullman porters in 1937.
            BSCP was a uniquely American institution, reflecting the racial discrimination which cut across all
                    levels of the American labor movement and society at large. The Pullman Palace Car Company employed
                    only black porters, and since the various railway brotherhoods barred Afro-Americans from
                    membership, BSCP leaders were forced to function simultaneously as both race and labor leaders.
            William H. Harris' technique of telling his story by juxtaposing the radically different
                    labor ideologies of the union's two key leaders, Asa Philip Randolph and Milton P. Webster,
                    succeeds quite well. An idealistic socialist when he assumed the presidency of BSCP in 1925,
                    Randolph believed that the union should act as a "guardian of black labor" (p.
                    164) and envisioned the Brotherhood as a "pioneering wedge that would open the doors of the
                    general American labor movement for  Afro-Americans"
                    (p. 218). As a race leader within the American Federation of Labor, he usually played the role of
                    racial propagandist, promoting conferences on the plight of black workers and urging economic
                    radicalism as a strategy for racial uplift. With such lofty aspirations, it is hardly surprising
                    that Randolph depended upon "pure and simple" labor leaders, such as Milton P.
                    Webster of the Chicago district, to conduct the daily operations of BSCP. Because Webster worried
                    more about enrolling new members than about a militant public image, he and Randolph constantly
                    bickered over policy priorities. Fortunately, each recognized the merits of the other's
                    position, enabling the Brotherhood to wield significantly more influence than its membership rolls
                    alone indicated.
            Although clearly written, Keeping the Faith, is so detailed that occasionally the
                    reader's interest meanders away from the narrative. Also, the influences of broader social
                    forces, such as the Great Depression, upon the Brotherhood's decision-making apparatus are
                    minimized, restricting the book's usefulness in answering larger issues which emerge from
                    the interaction between employer paternalism, laissezfaire government, the labor movement, and
                    racial oppression. This could have been alleviated by more extensive use of interpretive sources.
                    Nevertheless, this is a superb book which greatly enhances understanding of the internal structure
                    of BSCP during its crucial first decade of existence.

               Those Radio Commentators! By Irving E. Fang. (Ames: Iowa State University Press,
                    1977. Pp. ix, 341. Illustrations, bibliographies, index. $14.95.)
            This well-written, handsomely illustrated collection of biographical sketches of fifteen of the most
                    important radio commentators of the 1930s and the 1940s is both fascinating and entertaining, but
                    its value to historians is greatly lessened by the fact that the author did not document his
                    sources. This all too common recent phenomenon of omitting footnotes might be understandable in a
                    popularly written commercial book, but it is inexcusable for a university press to take such
                    unscholarly shortcuts. If university presses do not further the cause of scholarship, what then is
                    the purpose of their existence?
            It is difficult to quarrel with Irving E. Fang's belief that the radio commentators of the
                    1930s and the 1940s played a  vital role in influencing American
                    political opinion. Radio had clearly replaced the newspaper as the principal source of news for most
                    Americans by the 1930s. The most popular of the commentators, Walter Winchell, Edward R. Murrow, H.
                    V. Kaltenborn, Drew Pearson, and Elmer Davis, probably did influence more people than even the
                    inflated egos of some of them led them to believe. But, as Fang concedes, it is difficult, if not
                    impossible, to determine to what degree they influenced any one decision. For example, he raises the
                    question of whether American support for England in World War II would have been as strong as it was
                    without the talented Murrow to champion the British cause. There is no generally accepted scientific
                    method of proving this, but most observers agree that Murrow was the most effective single spokesman
                    for the British cause.
            Fang is on far weaker ground, however, when he appears to accept as true the testimony of Ernest
                    Cuneo, a man whom he describes as "an attorney with New Deal connections" (p. 264)
                    and later a member of Winchell's staff, to the effect that Winchell played a decisive role
                    in electing Franklin Roosevelt to a third term in 1940. Cuneo's story is that, at his
                    urging, Winchell began broadcasting support for Roosevelt's third term in 1938. The idea
                    was to bring Roosevelt's opposition out into the open "so that it could be
                    identified and fought" (p. 254). The strategy supposedly worked, and Fang gives Winchell
                    credit for Roosevelt's victory in 1940: "White House insiders said
                    Winchell's broadcasts and columns provided the 1940 victory margin" (p. 264).
                    Winchell's support undoubtedly was very helpful to Roosevelt, but not a single New Deal
                    scholar credits either Winchell or Cuneo with a major role in the 1940 election.
            The author does a good job in providing short, lively biographical sketches of some of
                    America's most colorful and eccentric radio personalities. He pulls no punches, yet does
                    not go out of his way to attack his subjects. He is probably the hardest on Winchell, whom he
                    describes as "petty and vicious" (p. 246). Even with Winchell, however, he
                    concludes on a positive note by saying that "at times he [Winchell] rose above the
                    smallness of his nature" (p. 273).
            Of special interest to readers of this journal is the very fine chapter on Elmer Davis, the product
                    of Aurora, Indiana, and Franklin College, whose Hoosier twang became a familiar sound to millions of
                    Americans. Davis, who went on from Franklin to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar, was indisputedly the most
                    intellectual  of all the commentators. He was also one of the
                    most respected members of his profession, a fact that led Franklin Roosevelt to name him the
                    director of the Office of War Information in 1942. The New York Times said it best
                    when it described Davis as a "horse-sense liberal … given neither to hysterical
                    hand wringing nor to fuzzy optimism" (p. 193).
            Fang has written a very readable and enjoyable account of several of the radio news personalities of
                    yesterday, ranging from the shallow, uneducated, raucous Winchell to the pompous, scholarly
                    Kaltenborn. Unfortunately, he has chosen to ignore most of the abundant archival sources so
                    carefully utilized by David Culbert in his News for Everyman (1976).
                    Fang's account contains a great deal of useful information, but serious students of
                    American radio should use it in conjunction with the more scholarly works of Culbert and Erik
                    Barnouw. A very attractive bonus feature is the inclusion of two soundsheets which contain short,
                    interesting excerpts from broadcasts of the fifteen radio commentators discussed in the book.

               From Main Street to State Street: Town, City, and Community in America. By Park
                    Dixon Goist. (Port Washington, N.Y.: Kennikat Press, 1977. Pp. 180. Notes and references,
                    bibliography, index. $12.50.)
            If close personal interaction, extensive cooperation, group solidarity, and a strong identification
                    with a locality define community, then most Americans associate community with the small town. The
                    erosion of community life as a consequence of the growth of large cities, in fact, has been a major
                    image in American thought since the 1890s. Yet by examining the writings of numerous
                        novelists, reformers, sociologists, and city planners who "sought to rethink the
                        meaning of community in terms more appropriate to large cities" (p. 7), Park Dixon
                    Goist reminds readers that the American cultural debate over the decline of community has been
                    considerable.
            Goist uses Booth Tarkington, Theodore Dreiser, and Robert and Helen Lynd, among others, to illustrate
                    the traditional image of community in town and city. Just as Tarkington's The
                        Gentleman from Indiana presents the small town as the embodiment of community life,
                    Dreiser's Sister Carrie consistently portrays the city as a chaotic world
                    devoid of socially sanctioned norms or long-term human bonds. And the Lynds' Middletown
                     suggests that Muncie lost its community cohesion as rapid
                    industrial growth divided the city into distinctly different business and working classes.
            As Goist shows, however, many American writers envisioned various degrees of community in the big
                    city. Some, like Hamlin Garland, saw only stultification and a repressive sameness in the small town
                    and took refuge in the cultural communities of European cities and New York. Jane Addams sought to
                    develop community cohesion within the urban neighborhood through the settlement house. Radical
                    journalists such as Hutchins Hapgood and Ernest Poole found group solidarity and meaningful social
                    interaction within the labor movement. Sociologist Robert Park theorized that occupational groups,
                    ethnic groups, churches, neighborhoods, and even street gangs provided social integration in the
                    city. Although Charles Mulford Robinson and John Nollen, two of the most influential American city
                    planners during the Progressive era, stressed the role of careful physical planning in enhancing
                    urban group life, neither, Goist suggests, ever questioned the possibility of viable community in
                    the city. Finally, Lewis Mumford had great faith in the potential ability of regional planning and
                    new towns to provide community in the modern metropolis if only modern man would value the community
                    experience above materialism.
            
               From Main Street to State Street very successfully demonstrates the wide range of
                    American thought about the possibilities of community life within large cities. The chapters
                    describing reformers, sociologists, and planners are more successful than those describing novelists
                    because of the greater focus and substance of the source materials. Clearer attention to the
                    writers' viewpoints regarding the social and political limitations of community based upon
                    only small intellectual, occupational, ethnic, or neighborhood subcommunities instead of the urban
                    population as a whole would have been useful. Yet, overall, the book provides a valuable basis to
                    compare the community images of many prominant American writers, including Tarkington and the Lynds.

               Trouble Downtown: The Local Context of Twentieth-Century America. By Henry F.
                    Bedford. (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., 1978. Pp. x, 213. Illustrations, notes, maps,
                    index. $5.95.)
            
            Henry F. Bedford designed his Trouble Downtown: The Local Context of Twentieth-Century
                        America as a supplementary reading for an undergraduate course in recent United States
                    history. His method is to employ six local incidents as "metaphors" of several
                    facets of the national experience in this century. Bedford develops these incidents against two
                    underlying themes: the "nationalization" of problems once thought to be entirely
                    within the realm of local authorities and the concomitant growth of federal involvement and
                    violence, or the threat of it, as a goad to reform.
            The episodes include the strike by the textile workers of Lawrence, Massachusetts, in 1912, the
                    illicit booze business of Chicago in the 1920s, the unionization of the Ford Motor
                    Company's River Rouge plant in 1932, the Detroit race riot of 1943, the Montgomery bus
                    boycott of 1955, and the Watts riot of 1965. The best chapters are those dealing with Lawrence and
                    Montgomery. Here the issues Bedford wishes to explore are sharply defined: the exploitation of
                    factory workers and their eventual resistance and segregation and its legal demise. In both
                    episodes, the winners achieved their limited goals through invoking the aid of non-local allies. And
                    in both cases violence or its threat had a role in precipitating the settlement.
            The remaining chapters are regrettably unfocused. In the chapter on Chicago in the 1920s, for
                    example, Bedford recounts the Capone gang's rise to power, but what larger issue the
                    chapter concerns is unclear. Possibly, it is the social consequences of urbanization, or the victory
                    of big-city mores over the values of small-town America. It may also be the decade's weary
                    disillusionment with reform or, indeed, the formation of crime syndicates as a particular form of
                    the nation-wide integration of business. Mentioning all of these, the chapter analyzes none nor does
                    it convincingly relate the Capone gang's history to any but the last. The chapter on the
                    two incidents in Detroit, like that on the Watts riot, suffers from a similar lack of focus.
            In Trouble Downtown, Bedford utilizes a definition of violence that encompasses not
                    only riots, wars, bombings, and beatings, but also "the ritualized violence of frenzied
                    production, the psychological violence of a disintegrating family, the internal violence that warped
                    individual personalities" (p. 127). So elastic a definition as this renders the concept
                    virtually useless as an' analytical tool.
            In brief, Trouble Downtown is an interesting effort to use local history to
                    illuminate national problems, but any instructor  utilizing it
                    should provide students with a sharper focus on the issues than Bedford supplies.

               A Guide to the State Archives of Michigan: State Records. By Valerie Gerrard
                    Browne and David Jerome Johnson. ([Lansing]: Michigan History Division, Michigan Department of
                    State, 1977. Pp. xx, 401. Illustrations, appendixes, index. $14.95.)
            This guide, published as a bicentennial project, describes all records accessioned by the Michigan
                    State Archives up to January 1, 1975, a total of ten thousand cubic feet. The introduction gives a
                    history of the state government organization and instructions on how to use the guide. Other
                    sections explain how record series are described and the rules and hours of the library.
                    Administrative histories describe the creation, functions, and changes in authority, name, or
                    structure of all state agencies. There are four appendixes, which list the governors and the federal
                    records, census schedules, and individual finding aids in the archives. Finally, there is a detailed
                    index.
            The book contains four main sections—the executive and legislative branches, the state
                    supreme court, and "Defunct, Miscellaneous, Superceded or Transferred Agencies."
                    Each agency constitutes one record group. In 1966 the executive branch was consolidated into
                    nineteen agencies. If the records of an agency were sent to the archives before the reorganization,
                    they are listed in the "Defunct, etc." section under the agency's old
                    name. Otherwise, all records appear under the names of the new umbrella agencies. If a bureau or
                    division moves to a different agency, the archives lists its records with the agency which actually
                    deposits the records. When the name of an agency changes, but the responsibilities do not, all its
                    records are listed under the latest name. All this requires the reader to use the administrative
                    histories, "See Also's," and index very carefully to follow a particular
                    governmental function as it moves around the governmental structure, appearing in different record
                    groups under different names. A cross-reference listing all current and defunct agencies by function
                    would have been helpful.
            On the whole, the guide is very well done. The series have distinct titles and comprehensive
                    descriptions, pinpointing the nature of the records available.

               A Bibliography on Historical Organization Practices: Interpretation. Compiled by
                    Rosemary S. Reese; edited by Frederick L. Rath, Jr., and Merrilyn Rogers O'Connell.
                    (Nashville: American Association for State and Local History, 1978. Pp. ix, 90. Appendix, index.
                    $10.00.)
            This slim volume, the third of the American Association for State and Local History's Bibliography on Historical Organization Practices, presents a useful compilation
                    of the literature on museum interpretation. Interpretation, according to the preface by editors
                    Frederick L. Rath and Merrilyn Rogers O'Connell, is the "way in which a museum
                    uses its resources to carry out its educational function …. " In other words, it
                    is the way in which a museum presents its message to the public.
            Although the compiler states several times that this bibliography is not comprehensive, the
                    literature of the field is adequately covered. What results is a well-organized volume that will be
                    of great use to anyone involved in the museum profession.
            The bibliography proper is divided into six major sections preceded by a selected "Basic
                    Reference Shelf that will provide anyone with a good working library. Chapters follow on the role of
                    interpretation, visitor surveys, museum programs, museums and schools, exhibits and museums in the
                    media age. Entries are annotated when their contents are not immediately apparent. Filmed and taped
                    materials are included in the listings.
            The book contains further helpful information. The first chapter is devoted to a survey of the major
                    national and international museum organizations and a summary of their purposes, professional
                    services, publications, and training programs. Smaller, specialized organizations are noted at the
                    ends of the appropriate sections of the bibliography. An appendix lists relevant subscription
                    information on all periodicals cited. This will be found especially helpful by those working in
                    small museums without ready access to libraries comprehensive enough to include professional museum
                    journals in their collections.
            The volume is easy to use and is further enhanced by a detailed index. It is a good, practical guide
                    that belongs on the shelf of anyone in any way involved in the operation of a museum.

                        To the Editor of the Indiana Magazine of History:
                        Donald Chaput's article on "The Family of Drouet de Richerville:
                                    Merchants, Soldiers, and Chiefs of Indiana" (June 1978, page
                                    103–116) is very welcome in this aspect of the study of Indiana and
                                    American history.
                        But it convinces me there is need for greater understanding of the Church's
                                    involvement in the lifestyle of that period. Footnote 52 on page 112, for instance,
                                    is a case in point. According to the Registre de la Paroisse de Sainte
                                        Anne du Detroit, Vol 2, 1704–1780, p. 819, the four children of
                                    Joseph Drouet, Sieur de Richerville, were baptized on May 14, 1773; but Cyprian
                                    Tanguay, Volume I, 127, reports these included the twins girls Charlotte and Anne
                                    who were both born on March 14, 1773.
                        Reading on in the parish register there can be found another boy named John-Baptist
                                    baptized within months, claiming the same father and a different mother who recorded
                                    as Richerville's wife.
                        Why is this in the register? Since the "Indian" lands were
                                    inherited via women the birth of twin daughters to Richerville must have been an
                                    inspiration to legitimize them by the christening. An old French custom, well-known,
                                    was to baptize children on their birthdate lest they die in the wilderness without
                                    the saving waters. At a convenient time the ceremonies were supplied, and still can
                                    be today, as the practice continues, in the nearest parish church where the friends
                                    and relatives could witness the christening ceremonies and the record be written
                                    down. Thus, Father Gibault records the baptism in Sainte Anne's Registre, it being the only parish church around Ft. Wayne other
                                    than Vincennes.
                        Furthermore, it is plain Richerville is not married to these children's
                                    mother. The French plainly says the infants were born "avec une Miamise
                                    avec laquelle il habite depuis pleusieurs années." Even today,
                                    to refer to a couple "living together" is telling. This
                                    "Miami woman," according to Bessie

                                    p. 2 (a booklet of the Fort Wayne Public Library, n.d.) is identified in Henry
                                    Hay's Journal as the sister of "Chief
                                    Pacanne" Roy, a grandson of Pierre and Marguerite Ouabankikoue Roy, also
                                    Detroiters. This sister, Tacumwa or Marie-Louise Roy, is Joseph Drouet's
                                    "Miami woman". She is not Little
                                    Turtle's older sister (as Chaput suggests on page 113). This can be
                                    understood when one realizes Richardville had taken as his paramour a girl with
                                    prominent Detroit relatives; hence she is passed off as "a Miami
                                    woman." Also, the "Indians" of the Miami Nation, as Bert
                                    Anson and others explain, referred to all their relatives as sisters and brothers,
                                    not having words for cousins and so on that would be our English meaning.
                        The Roy couple had another daughter also named Marie-Louise who married Alexis
                                    Trottier dit Beaubien de Ruisseux. She was born 1708 and died 1735; she is confused
                                    with Tacumwa sometimes, since the Widow Richardville (Tacumwa) is recorded to have
                                    also married an Alexis Beaubien. She spent a lot of time working for
                                    John-Baptist's interests, however. This is in both the Detroit and
                                    Vincennes registers.
                        Finally, John-Baptist "born under an apple tree" near the village
                                    of Lalabiche, Fort Wayne, in 1761 was later known as The Wildcat (Pishewa).
                                    According to Vesper Wilkinson's compilation of the "Descendants of
                                    Francis Godfroy" in the Miami County Historical Museum, his son Bird-Eyed
                                    and three daughters were related to James Raridan Godefroy via Catherine's
                                    marriage to Francis LaFontaine.
                        So much for this clarification.
                        
                                    
                                        Anthony J. Prosen
                                    
                                
                     
                  
               
                
            
                    
                  
                     
                        To the Editor of the Indiana Magazine of History:
                        Dr. Prosen's major point, that I failed to understand why the baptismal
                                    entries were in the Detroit registers, remains a mystery to me. As an historian I
                                    cannot often use such phrases as "must have been." I have not the
                                    slightest proof, nor theory, as to why Father Gibault entered the facts in the
                                    Detroit registers. Dr. Prosen's suggestion may be correct. However,
                                    distance, and travel plans would also have to be considered. What if Father Gibault
                                    was leaving soon for Kaskaskia; would he still enter the births there, or would he
                                    prefer to enter them at the closest parish, Detroit?
                        Two other points raised by Dr. Prosen have been covered in the article. I do not
                                    state that Richerville was married to anyone. On p. 112 I wrote of
                                    "Joseph's relationship with 
                                    Tecumwah." He also mentions that Jean-Baptiste was known as "the
                                    Wildcat (Pishewa)." I did mention this, in the top paragraph on p. 114.
                        I admit that Tecumwah's background is not as definite as I suggested. She
                                    does appear to be related to Little Turtle, but the degree of relationship is
                                    questionable. For example, Bert Anson (p. 178) leaves the question open; the John Tipton Papers, XXIV, 323n., states that she was a sister of
                                    Little Turtle. When the Richerville papers first came to public notice, in Magazine of American History, XXIV (July, 1890), 45–51,
                                    the author examined them, printed excerpts and documents in full, and concluded that
                                    Tecumwah was the daughter of Chief Aque-nosh-qua and that she was a sister of Little
                                    Turtle.
                        It is not clear to me what point Dr. Prosen is raising in his last paragraph. The
                                    inter-relationships of the Richerville family with the Godfroys and Lafontaines is
                                    well-established, and well-known.
                        It is obvious that Dr. Prosen is familiar with many of the individuals mentioned in
                                    my article, and I appreciate having his comments. His point about the pride, and
                                    mystery, about twins is especially interesting, and perhaps I can gather more cases
                                    to see how this principle worked on the frontier.
