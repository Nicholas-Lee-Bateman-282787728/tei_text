            <byline>Edited by Rodney O. Davis<hi rend="sup">∗</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>Shortly after the Civil War, Samuel and Margaret Myers and three of their seven living children
                    migrated from Fairbanks, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, to <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. Samuel was sixty years old, and two of the sons who accompanied him to Missouri had
                    fought in the guerilla-ravaged area of southwestern Missouri during the war. Perhaps not
                    surprisingly, correspondence between the Missouri and Indiana branches of the Myers clan began
                    almost immediately. Because the difficulties of resettlement in a semi-frontier area were a major
                    preoccupation for those who moved west, letters "back home" detailed these
                    concerns. Homesickness and sorrow over separation, along with the hard economic times and the
                    grasshopper visitation of the mid-1870s on the Middle Border, were frequent subjects of
                    correspondence. Between 1871 and 1879 the letter writers included for the most part an overworked
                    and ultimately ailing Samuel Myers, his wife Margaret, and their crippled son <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName>; the principal recipients were Margaret (Maggie) Myers Harris and Mary Myers Davis, two
                    of the three Myers children who remained in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan County</region>
                    </placeName>. Culminating points in this early correspondence were letters detailing the illnesses
                    and subsequent deaths of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Samuel, the latter resulting from a prolonged seige of cancer. Minor themes
                    involved the two other Myers sons who accompanied their parents to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>; the marriage of Samuel Barnes Myers to Martha C. (Clem) Reynolds and the death three

            </p>
            <p>A second set of Myers letters, written between 1879 and 1895, is more concerned with the three
                    members of the Myers second generation who did not follow Samuel west immediately but who finally
                    did so within five years of his death. Shortly before the presidential election of 1880, and before
                    the birth of their fifth child, Maggie and Jacob Harris migrated to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vernon County</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. They remained there, near relatives, for fifteen years before making a final rather
                    dramatic move to the Cherokee Outlet after the death of Maggie's mother. In 1883, three
                    years after Jake's and Maggie's departure from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan County</region>
                    </placeName>, Mary and John Davis and Charles and Bell Myers nearly simultaneously left Indiana to
                    relocate in Walton Township, Harvey County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>. There the Davises would remain, but the Myers, four years later, made an ill-starred
                    foray into the frontier of western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>. That effort a failure, in 1891 Charles and Bell retraced their steps somewhat and
                    reestablished themselves in Thayer County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>, perhaps to be near Musa, their daughter who had "run away" and
                    married in 1889. Margaret Myers, Samuel's widow, remained in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vernon County</region>
                    </placeName>, living a rather typical nineteenth-century widow's life of dependency with
                    the families of her three children who lived there. As she aged, her letters became briefer and
                    increasingly more querulous. Her death in 1891, and the final migration of Jake and Maggie Harris to
                    Oklahoma four years later, bring the Myers letters to an appropriate close.</p>
            <p>It can certainly be argued that the move to Missouri was productive of neither satisfaction nor
                    security for Samuel or Margaret Myers. It led instead to an ultimately unfulfilling and fruitless
                    regime of very hard work at an advanced age and to frustration generated by the hard times of the
                    middle 1870s. Although <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s early death was probably not unexpected, Samuel could not have anticipated
                    the cancer that befell him before he died. The expenses that attended both <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s illnesses and Samuel's futile cancer treatment left the patriarch
                    with severely diminished resources at the time of his own demise. In spite of that, he was surely
                    buttressed by the support of his sons Nelson and especially Barnes, who remained in the
                    neighborhood, and by the concern of his other children.</p>
            <p>Nelson and Barnes Myers were able to do better than their father did in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vernon County</region>

                    market gardening. Barnes, on the other hand, never once left the area; he continued to farm

                        <country reg="nvu">Nevada</country>
                    </placeName>. In the third generation, Barnes's and Clem's son Lewis, born soon
                    after the devastating loss of their first child, was to become a director and vice-president of <placeName>
                        <country reg="nvu">Nevada</country>
                    </placeName>'s First National Bank.</p>
            <p>Maggie and Jake Harris never really took hold in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, staying as they did in three different <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vernon County</region>
                    </placeName> locations while there. Furthermore, their early years in Oklahoma territory were
                    difficult, and although they were somewhat younger than Maggie's parents had been when
                    leaving Fairbanks in 1869, they nevertheless had to begin from scratch on a true frontier, in a
                    country previously unsettled by Europeans. By the time of their final move, however, they also had
                    adult children to help in the pioneering process. They were eventually able to build a comfortable
                    home, to acquire community status, and indeed to be locally revered as old settlers in their
                    advanced age. Perhaps significantly, Maggie established the community's first Sunday
                    School, which met in the family dugout.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> As was almost always the case with the
                    third generation of Samuel Myers's family, the Harris children rooted themselves near their
                    parents in their final home in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>. Mary and John Davis stayed in the Walton area till their deaths; John eventually
                    abandoned storekeeping and took up farming again near the town. They and their sons, who also
                    remained in Harvey County, were respected members of a community that would be moderately
                    prosperous.</p>
            <p>Of all the children of Samuel and Margaret Myers, Charles and his wife Bell had the largest family to
                    raise. In retrospect, Charlie's optimism about his chances for success in western Kansas
                    seems almost pathetic; hindsight has demonstrated that he and Bell pushed their luck by migrating to
                    that sub-humid region in the mid-1880s. Consequently, like thousands of other immigrants who could
                    not support themselves in western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1891 a middle-aged and somewhat disabled Charlie Myers took his family north and
                    east to rented land in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>, an older-settled region where he, Bell, and several of their children were to remain.</p>
            <p>Overall, the collection of Myers family correspondence reflects rather typical concerns of
                    transplanted Hoosiers; rarely is any of the correspondence speculative. Instead, family members
                    concerned themselves with more concrete topics, such as the amount of dried peaches or the extent of
                    a wet spring. Reading the letters almost a century later permits a rather easy understanding of the
                    range of emotion the migrating Myers family experienced.</p>

                              <hi rend="sup">1</hi> In order to allow the correspondents to speak for
                                        themselves, the second installment of the Myers family letters that follows has
                                        been minimally edited. Spelling, grammar, and syntax have been transcribed
                                        exactly as written. Although an attempt was made to determine the punctuation
                                        intended by each writer, it was virtually impossible to distinguish among
                                        commas, periods, pen rests, and blots. In addition, various family members used
                                        dashes, ditto marks, number signs, and lines of dots both within and at the end
                                        of sentences. Frequently there was no punctuation at all. In order to facilitate
                                        reading and avoid confusion, double spaces have been inserted between sentences
                                        whether or not any kind of punctuation appeared, and seemingly indiscriminate
                                        commas, ditto marks, number signs, etc., have been ignored. Decisions concerning
                                        vowels and capitalization were also at times necessarily arbitrary. Spacing of
                                        headings, salutations, paragraphs, and closings has been standardized. Obvious
                                        unintentional repetitions have been omitted. A three-or four-dot ellipsis
                                        indicates omission of a few words or sentences, while a line of dots signals
                                        omission of one or more paragraphs. Only occasionally were lengthy blocks of
                                        material omitted for their marginal importance. Information crowded in at the
                                        top or sides of the letters has usually been inserted as a postscript. Illegible
                                        words or phrases have been so indicated in brackets, and questionable
                                        transcriptions are followed by a bracketed question mark. An attempt has been
                                        made to identify all family members-013 as many other individuals as
                                        possible—to whom there is reference in the letters. Birth and death
                                        dates were taken from family Bibles and cemetery records or inferred from
                                        federal census manuscript records.</item>

                        <p>We have had verry good health So far this mild winter. I saw Cousin Jake on the 13
                                    and had a talk with him and he said that he was favorable to coming oute but could
                                    not until fall on account of parties owing him and to collect it he will have to
                                    waite for the coming crops to get his pay.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> I advised him to go
                                    and settle and take theire notes and specify how they should be paid and then he
                                    could sell them or have them collected by others, he said that he was not in debt.
                                    But I tell you what I think <hi rend="i">its mere guess work</hi> that so many owing
                                    him leaves him short of ready money and I think that this is the trouble. I would
                                    write to Magy or Mary to find oute if it was So and then write to him. if need be to
                                    advance him monie to move on I asked him how he would go he said by rail and ship
                                    his Horses by rail. And another thing I would make a statement what each other would
                                    expect of one another in order to avoide confusion that may or might arise in coming
                                    events his cousin told me that Jake had said he wanted to go west and from our
                                    convesation he said the same And he thinks this a good oppertunity I told him that
                                    you wanted him and did not want to let Straingers have your place to ruin it I think
                                    he sees the it would be to his advantage to go to some place where he could
                                    accumulate land for his coming family. I think you can induce him to come I think it
                                    such a misfortune when an opertunity is opened up that young folk do not improve it.
                                    And I consider this a good one for him better than probly he will meet with again he
                                    likes you and said that he would have no difficulty in getting along. I will go for
                                    him again and if you wish for me to say any more to him send me word what to Say and
                                    I will do So.</p>
                        <p>If Geo Was Single I would advise you to have him to move to Some western town it
                                    might be the means of changing him to a new life and usefull to himself and
                                    children. If Charley is not doing well he ought to where he is and I think he is

                        <p>Your Ma has been writing to you, and I will write you a line or two she came over to
                                    see us day before yesterday and we brought her home this morning, we wanted her to
                                    stay longer but as it is cold she thought she would rather come home, she has her
                                    room here at [illegible] and is more comfortably situated than she is with us. we
                                    tried to get her to go and stay with us but we have but two rooms and it is a little
                                    lonesome there and she did not think she could be satisfied there though I am sure I
                                    would do all I could to make it pleasant for her I think she has a very pleasant
                                    family on the place, but when she has children it does not seem right to be living
                                    with strangers. I do wish some of you there could come out and live with her. I

                  <hi rend="sup">20</hi> Pence was a short-lived village in northwest Scott County, <placeName>

                        </placeName>, three counties east of the Colorado border. Though free land was available in
                        Scott County for homestead and preemption entry, the area was heavily affected by drought and
                        crop failure and general retrenchment after the speculative boom of the mid-1880s. Charlie Myers
                        farmed and operated a blacksmith shop there. Scott County was a bit more fortunate than some
                        neighboring counties, as it was crossed by recently finished lines of the Missouri Pacific and
                        Santa Fe railroads. But the railroads, unfortunately, were built far to the south of Pence. See

                                            Harris and her family were to make one more move. Jake made the run into the
                                            Cherokee Outlet in September, 1893, and claimed a quarter-section in Pawnee
                                            County that was patented ten years later. He lived alone on the claim during
                                            the first winter, trapping muskrats on the nearby Neosho River. In the early
                                            spring of 1895 he moved his family to a dugout on his claim and steadily
                                            improved the farm. Jake and Maggie remained there until his death in 1927
                                            and hers in 1943. Clella Kelley and Phyllis Anderson, interview with author,

            <p>Although fairly consistent records exist for the period 1875–1895, the data from the years
                    1877–1879 and 1887–1891 were chosen because information contained no gaps,
                    because termination data and comments for all admissions were given, and because the time period
                    represented relative economic prosperity. Studying periods of economic depression would have shown a
                    "worst case" situation, giving a distorted picture of the poorhouse. In addition
                    to these considerations, the nature of Indiana poorhouses changed dramatically between 1895 and

                    "It shall be the duty of the General assembly, as soon as circumstances will permit, to
                    form a penal Code, founded on the principles of reformation, and not on vindictive Justice: and also

                    of paupers in a single facility was an objective as early as 1839, when commissioners requested that

                    boarding. In 1841 rent for the poorhouse was ordered paid to Willaim S. Vail in the amount of
                    $46.66 for four months. As superintendent of the poorhouse, Daniel Fuller was paid
                    $20.00 per month. Alexander Holloway was given $4.50 for boarding paupers and
                    furnishing a small coffin, and George Stephens was paid $15.75 for three coffins.
                    Attendance upon and medicine for a needy family and others were charged at $35.37 and
                    paid. Dr. Griffin Smith was paid the considerable sum of $120.00 for care and medicine
                    for a poor individual. Other expenses covered shoes for a pauper and hay and cowbells for the cows
                    kept for the benefit of the poor at the poor farm.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>The poor relief budget grew over the years and reflected changes in practice at the poorhouse. In
                    1841 the commissioners instructed the new supervisor of the poorhouse that "it shall be his
                    duty to examine the condition of said paupers at least once in each week and whenever in his
                    judgement he shall find that any pauper has so [recovered] in health and strength to be able to
                    support themselves, he shall forthwith discharge them."16 A careful look at relief

                    the poor. It could be easily reached for inspection, but it was far enough removed so as to be
                    outside the potentially evil influence of the city. It was also located on the boundary line of the

                                200 acres, with a remarkably pleasant and convenient family residence. The building in
                                which the poor are kept is in the rear of this, and very defective in construction and
                                in the general plan, and poorly furnished. I found here but two who were dependent on
                                the public and on the Superintendent for their support and daily comforts; one, an
                                insane man, who had in the winter been found in the woods with his feet frozen; the
                                other, an aged negro. "The number of inmates increases as the winter months
                                advance. Formerly the poor were kept in the town, but serious evils attended this
                                arrangement, and now the opposite extreme is adopted, they being too far removed to come

                            frame. The main building contains the Superintendent's residence, quarters for the
                            help and rooms for the better class of women-inmates, and has a basement used as a kitchen
                            and dinning-room; this building was in excellent order and very comfortably furnished
                            throughout. There are two other one story buildings for the rest of the inmates, one of
                            brick for the women and one of frame for the men, which are not very cheerful, but were in
                            fair order and clean. In the men's building are several cell-rooms for the insane,

                            all the dependent children. There is a bath house with tubs, regularly used. Most of the
                            paupers are feeble and old. The chronic insane, who are able-bodied, are for the most part
                            usefully employed. On the whole the management appeared very good, with the exception of the
                            treatment of the more violent insane, and the Superintendent and wife impressed me as being
                            intelligent and conscientious people. An elaborate set of rules for the government of the
                            Institution is displayed in each sitting-room and hall. If these are lived up to there will
                            be little fault to find with this asylum. The Superintendent's salary is
                            $600 per annum. Annual net cost is about $5,000. Average number of
                            inmates about 47. Weekly cost per inmate about $2.04.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>

                            improvement over the facilities which existed before that time for caring for the poor. The
                            arrangement of separate buildings for the men and women provides good sex separation.</p>
                        <p>When visited the asylum was found in a good state of cleanliness and the same may be said of
                            the inmates. Bathing is required weekly of every inmate and each department has a bath tub.
                            Clothing appeared to be of fair quality and the beds were furnished. The part of the asylum
                            occupied by the Superintendent's family is heated by a furnace; the part occupied
                            by inmates by means of stoves in the corridors. Some interior improvements in the brick
                            building during the past year have increased the conveniences and comforts of the kitchen
                            and dining room.</p>
                        <p>The farm has one of the handsomest and most commodious barns in the County. Fences are in

                        <p>Among the principal needs of the asylum are day rooms for the inmates, who now sit only in
                            the corridors. A better water supply is urgently needed also. At present all water used in
                            the asylum must be carried out of doors. The institution appeared to be in most particulars
                            well managed. The Superintendent in control at the time of this visit was to be succeeded
                            December 1st by a man who had offered to take the place for a salary $50 smaller
                            than the salary paid to the Superintendent already in charge.</p>
                        <p>The average number of inmates is about seventy-five, and the average weekly cost of

            <p>The township trustee, who was directly responsible for outdoor relief, was also required to see that
                    those requiring indoor relief were sent to the poorhouse. Contrary to what one might suspect,
                    poverty and destitution were not given as the most common causes for admission to the poorhouse. In
                    most cases poverty accompanied other conditions and circumstances. People were obviously poor when
                    they arrived at the poorhouse, but it is clear from records <list type="footnotes">

                    precipitate a stay at the poorhouse (see Figure 1). Sickness and age, for example, were major
                    reasons; persons too ill to care for themselves or elderly men and women unable physically to
                    practice food preparation or hygiene were often admitted. Many aged people, perhaps, either had no
                    one who could house them or hoped to avoid burdening relatives or friends with their presence. The
                    discharge category "taken away by relatives" applied to several elderly people
                    after a short stay. The terms "orphan," "homeless," and
                    "deserted" usually described women and children. The very young were normally not
                    expected to provide their own living, and the loss of one or both parents added extra trauma to
                    difficult times. Women left homeless because of abuse, separation, or divorce or because they had
                    rebelled against parental authority or committed some indiscretion had no immediate means of support
                    and often no place to stay. Most women who bore children at the poorhouse left within a few weeks
                    "to find work." The homeless and deserted were probably capable of work and
                    self-support but were caught without short-term means.</p>
            <p>Sex ratios, however, showed clear patterns. More men than women were admitted in both time periods,
                    but the proportion of women in the later group was much higher than the 1877–1879 group.
                    Nevertheless, more than three-fourths of those admitted overall were male, which differs markedly
                    from Katz's pre-1870 figures, but less so from his 1870–1886 data.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Age on admission varied widely according to condition (see Figure 2). Those accepted primarily for
                    old age were mostly in their sixties in the 1877–1879 group, but nearly all were in their
                    seventies in the 1887–1891 group, The small number of admissions of those ages
                    demonstrates that few people, particularly the poor, lived into their eighties in the late
                    nineteenth century. Those who were sick when they arrived at the poorhouse were distributed very
                    evenly by age (see Figure 3). Nearly equal numbers from the 13–19 age group through the
                    70–79 category were admitted for treatment of illness. The
                    "simpleminded" and the "insane," however, tended to be in their
                    twenties and thirties. Even though the 1887–1891 group covered a longer period of time,
                    fewer admissions were recorded for mental disorders because new state hospitals for the insane were
                    constructed or completed during this time and increasing numbers of the chronically insane were sent

            <p>The two largest age groups admitted under the heading "destitute/poor" were those
                    in their forties and sixties. Only one person aged 30-39 was admitted because of poverty over the
                    period of study. The very young and the very old were most often accepted because they were
                    homeless. Over 58 percent of these petitioners were under twelve or over seventy, but some homeless
                    people came from all age groups. Those admitted for pregnancy were most often aged 13–19;
                    fewer women in their twenties sought shelter, and only one woman over thirty.</p>
            <p>Given the severity of northern Indiana winters, one might expect seasonal patterns for admissions,
                    but this was not the case (see Figure 4).<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Entries to the poorhouse were
                    highest in January, March, and May and relatively high in July, October, and December. These figures
                    suggest that poorhouse admissions rose during periods of increased mobility; that is, when people
                    traveled in order to look for work or perhaps in response to the seasonal pattern of agricultural
                    labor. Arriving in <placeName>

                    and looking for new work. Warmer weather provided the opportunity for travel with reduced danger of
                    cold. While at least one study of another region showed an increase during the winter months and
                    decline in warm weather, seasonal variations tended to be a feature of large metropolitan areas.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

                    any definition. A few who were helped at the poor farm were from outside the county, but they did
                    not stay for an extended period. The trustee referral system minimized aid for outsiders.</p>
            <p>Death proved to be the second most significant means of escape from the poorhouse (see Figure 5),
                    indicating the large number of elderly and seriously sick or injured who received care. Cause of
                    death often does not appear in the ledger. Although some who died were taken by friends and
                    relatives for burial, many were interred in area cemeteries or on the poor farm at county expense.
                    It is a sad scenario to consider the sense of desolation that must have accompanied an approaching
                    anonymous death in the poorhouse and burial at the county farm. Records also indicate that one could
                    be discharged from the poorhouse; there was a distinction often made between "left
                    voluntarily" or "left to get work" and <list type="footnotes">

                    of stay in the two periods was 311.1 days. This figure, however, is high because it reflects lodging
                    of all residents; one elderly person stayed over sixteen years. For those sheltered less than one
                    year, the average time was sixty-four days. The poorhouse most often catered to those who stayed
                    less than thirty days; only the elderly tended toward permanent residency as a group. Others were
                    assisted and then encouraged to leave.</p>
            <p>Records indicate, then, that the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph County</region>
                    </placeName> poorhouse was a short-term residence, although for the elderly it was often a long-term
                    home and occasionally a final resting place. If it was not the most desirable place to live,
                    eyewitness reports described it as at least minimally comfortable; surely it offered advantages over
                    living on the street. The poverty of the poorhouse's residents was taken for granted, but
                    other factors strongly influenced the decision to go there as well. Poor relief officials generally
                    showed a genuine concern for the poor while simultaneously closely monitoring limited budgets. Their
                    assumption, and the sense of the poor relief system, was that at least some help must be given to
                    the helpless.</p>
            <p>Sources also indicate that changes in outdoor relief policy, if they occurred in Indiana in this
                    period, did not increase the number of individuals who were assisted at the poorhouse. The <placeName>

                    numbers in residence slowly shrank. If anything, changes became less, rather than more, punitive in
                    nature. More research is needed to determine whether "less eligibility" became a
                    criterion for the administration of outdoor relief in Indiana and the remainder of the Midwest and
                    whether economic prosperity, poor relief policy, or an as yet unknown factor affected the
                    composition of the residents of Indiana's poorhouse.</p>

            <p>Indiana homemakers formed the first home economics clubs in 1913 to receive home economics lessons
                    developed by the Cooperative Extension Service of Purdue University. In 1980 the Indiana Extension
                    Homemakers Association (IEHA) launched a statewide oral history project to commemorate the
                    seventy-fifth anniversary of the first clubs in 1988. IEHA originally intended to prepare an
                    organizational history, but planners discovered a "lack of documentation" on the
                    subject and thus extended their inquiry to include an exploration of homemaking itself. IEHA
                    volunteers attended workshops on oral history methodology before conducting and transcribing
                    interviews with almost three hundred Indiana homemakers from nearly every county in the state. Since
                    most of the women interviewed were over seventy, fieldworkers sought in particular to recover
                    experiences of homemakers between 1910 and the 1940s.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    families, including courtship, marriage, childbirth, child rearing, and widowhood. The volumes are
                    arranged topically with relevant segments of interviews presented under each heading, and each
                    segment in turn is identified by the interviewee's name, county of residence when
                    interviewed, and age, making it possible to approximate the time period of each recollection. Arnold

                    changes. Splendid photographs, gathered from women around the state and from collections at Purdue

                        general.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> It is unclear whether the occasional failures to probe revealing
                    or insightful statements resulted from editorial decisions or the actual interviews. Readers will be
                    frustrated at times with the short excerpts of interviews and will likely yearn for longer
                    conversations with some of the women.</p>
            <p>It is also regrettable that each section's introduction merely summarizes women's
                    comments and makes few connections to broader historical themes. An appendix offering some
                    indication of the socioeconomic status, religion, ethnic background, and farm or small-town location
                    would have been helpful; as it stands, inferences on how economic, social, religious, or residential
                    differences affected the choices the homemakers and their families made are left to the readers.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Finally, the repetition of several recollections in different volumes detracts
                    from the project's effectiveness. These flaws do not, however, minimize the overall
                    achievement of Arnold and the many women working with her.</p>
            <p>A number of themes—either explicit or implicit—appear throughout the five IEHA
                    volumes: neighborhood interdependence, effects of technological change, gender roles on the farm,
                    and the significance of home economics and associational activities for rural women. In an attempt
                    to highlight these general facets of rural life, this essay will quote extensively from the
                    homemakers' own words in order to convey the richness of their recollections. It will also
                    attempt to place these topics in the larger contexts of twentieth-century life and women's
                    history and to suggest the significance of this data in connection with some historiographical
                    issues in these fields. Neighborliness in rural Indiana communities in the first decades of the

            <p>Entire neighborhoods gathered for summer threshings and late autumn butcherings and combined
                    socializing with hard physical labor. These days were especially happy for younger children who
                    "loved to run around" while the adults worked. Nothing went to waste among their
                    thrifty and practical elders who found ways to use all parts of the hogs; even the bladders on
                    butchering days were blown up "as children play with balloons today."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The work involved in threshing and butchering and preserving pork was strictly

                    the hogs, hung the carcasses, and rendered the lard, while the women prepared the dinners for the
                    large gatherings and cleaned the entrails for sausage casings: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            take the entrails out… .</p>
                        <p>As soon as the entrails were emptied and brought in, three or four women with their little

                            because it was necessary that they be clean. If the hogs didn't have worms, you had
                            a good casing to stuff sausage.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                            mid-nineteenth century, there is a remarkable similarity between the gender role assignments
                            he found and those described in <hi rend="i">Memories of Hoosier Homemakers.</hi> His
                            working definition of gender is one that also serves well in understanding rural Indiana

                            and the ways they think and feel about what they do, as well as how and why they do what

                    in the entire neighborhood was over, a threshing meeting was held to settle up: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Everybody had to pay the men that did the threshing, and if some of them had had more

                            wouldn't take anything, they just did it because of the friendship and fellowship
                            with each other.</p>

                    </quote> At the end of each butchering day, meat would be distributed to neighbors. One woman
                    remembered giving away meat but added, "We were always generous because they were generous
                    to us." Neighbors, some of whom even specified the pieces they wanted, took home fresh
                    meat, and "then when they butchered you got it back."<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After neighbors departed on butchering days, hard work remained for homemakers, who had primary
                    responsibility for preserving the pork. Home freezers were not marketed until the early 1950s, and
                    locker plants were not common before World War II, which made food storage a critical job:
                    "The day of the butchering wasn't so hard on the women as the next day, when you
                    had to get the meat all ready. Now that was the woman's big day."<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Details on diverse methods of making sausage and curing meat indicated family specialties,
                    different ethnic influences, and variations within communities on how best to preserve the pork
                    without waste.</p>
            <p>Butcherings and threshings were special events necessitating neighborly reciprocity, but homemakers
                    depended daily upon one another in more mundane ways. They traded fruits, cooked meals in times of
                    sickness, offered to run errands, and, crucial for baking, shared their yeast starter when
                    another's ran out or soured: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>They all expected to share with one another. If you ran out of your yeast, why they just went

                            mother, then she'd bake her bread the next day, and take it back to them, then they

            <p>Cooperation between neighbors was even important in securing electricity, which transformed food
                    preservation and preparation along with several other facets of homemaking. Recollections recorded
                    in <hi rend="i">Party Lines, Pumps and Privies</hi> of initial reactions to electrical power and
                    appliances offer valuable evidence of the cultural impact of technological change on ordinary
                    people, especially on women who had been homemakers for years before the innovations were available
                    to them.</p>
            <p>Power lines penetrated rural Indiana gradually. The Rural Electric Membership Corporation in Indiana
                    extended electrical power to many farm families in the 1930s, but a sizable number remained without
                    electricity until after World War II. Although most were aware of electricity's potential
                    benefits for their own lives—some families generated their own electricity with a Delco
                    battery system<hi rend="sup">19</hi>—neighborly persuasion was often needed to obtain
                    enough new customers to support and justify an electrical line: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Several evenings we had the neighbors in to talk about it.</p>
                        <p>There had to be quite a few patrons on the line within a mile for them to be willing to do
                            it. We also had to agree to each of us buy an appliance so that they would be sure that we
                            would use enough electricity to pay them to put the lines out.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I think there were eleven of us signed up, and they were willing to do it.
                            That's the way we got our line—by pushing that project.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

                    </quote> Homemaker clubs and extension agents, in educating people about electricity, also
                    indirectly promoted rural consumerism; demonstrations were given on "how much light
                    you'd get from a candle, and then how much you'd get from an electric
                    bulb." In addition, homemaker clubs addressed the issue of cost, a major concern of many
                    rural families during the Depression era. "So many people thought we couldn't
                    afford it, and the lesson was `We Can't Afford <hi rend="i">Not</hi> To Use
                    Electricity,'" one narrator recalled. Despite these efforts there were "a
                    lot of people that didn't do it"; some not only resisted electricity for
                    themselves but "wouldn't let them set poles on their place, so electricity could
                    go past them on that road."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

                    gender divisions in family spending practices: because women shopped for groceries, advertisers
                    targeted women, but in almost all of these recollections, the first appliances were purchased by men
                    because they were held responsible for credit and finances. Although no single appliance appears to
                    have made the most difference in women's lives, there is a clear consensus that
                    "electricity made it so much easier to do many things involved in home and
                    housekeeping." Over and over the women expressed in unpretentious and straightforward terms
                    this sentiment: "Electricity, it's wonderful. I wish I could have had it all my

            <p>As the shift from kerosene and gasoline lamps to electric light bulbs progressed, family lifestyles

                    over, it was about bedtime," a Pulsaki County resident remembered. The difficulty of doing
                    chores at night was evident in one woman's memory of canning after dark: "I
                    don't know how many flies and things we canned, because we couldn't see. But we
                    did it, and it didn't kill us."<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Women also recalled the
                    dirt, smells, and dangers of kerosene and gasoline lamps. "Every once in a while Mom would
                    say, `Well, we've got to have fresh air in here,' and she'd open up the
                    door or the windows. She was always afraid the fumes from the lamps would suffocate us."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> In adddition, the oral histories evoke the sense of awe and wonder associated
                    with first seeing one's home electrified: "I remember the first night we had it
                    [electricity]. Daddy had been out and didn't know they had come and turned it on. So we let
                    him start to the barn with the lanterns and then we turned it on. The expression he had on his
                    face—there was no way you could describe it."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Finally,
                    pitfalls of inexperience with electricity were also recorded. Apparently, home extension lessons on
                    its use had not reached everyone because more than one woman spoke of her own
                    "lesson" with electricity: "One night I decided that I would fix my light
                    plug and—without turning off the current—I attempted to cut off the plug.
                    Needless to say, I had a nice indentation in my knife. The electricity just melted the knife where I
                    tried to cut it."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

                    concludes that "in the forty years since the end of the Second World War, the amenities
                    that were once reserved for just part of the population have become the basic standard for the lives

            <p>Cowan's central thesis, however, that the "diffusion of amenities was accompanied
                    … by increases in the amount of work that some housewives had to do, and in the level of
                    productivity that others were able to achieve," does not accurately reflect the experiences

                    middle-class urban women and while her comments about increased productivity and greater results are
                    certainly applicable to the Hoosier homemakers, the evidence in these interviews makes it impossible
                    to believe that the amount of housework was greater for postwar rural women than for their mothers.
                    "The work processes of housework may have changed substantially since 1940," Cowan
                    notes, "but the work itself has not gone away."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Overall,
                    Cowan gives too little weight to the changes in the process and the amount of physical labor

                    Prohibition, for whatever reasons, are neglected. Several of the interviewees, for example, are old
                    enough to have been among the first generation of women voters and to have lived through World War I
                    and Prohibition, and while younger women were able to recall in detail their mothers'
                    attitudes and activities in other areas, they, too, might have had some interesting observations on
                    these topics. Since several women had recollections of the war, one wishes that more specific
                    questions had been asked. "What do you remember about World War I?" elicited

                    rural Indiana. These Klan stories compensate for the disappointments of this volume. The revived Ku
                    Klux Klan had more members in Indiana in the early 1920s than in perhaps any other state; estimates
                    range from a quarter to a half million members.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> The commonplace nature of the
                    Klan in rural Indiana is evident in the matter-of-fact tone found in many recollections;
                    interviewees remember that the KKK was present, that some neighbors and relatives were members, and
                    that it was secretive and mysterious, especially to children. "I had an uncle that had

                            … and possibly even the housewife's working time, which was now spread

            <p>This very provocative section of <hi rend="i">Memories of Hoosier Home-makers</hi> suggests several
                    questions for additional oral histories on the Indiana Ku Klux Klan. Was there a lingering mistrust
                    within communities after the membership declined later in the decade? Were KKK activities later
                    perceived as aberrations from community values, or were they reflections of values that were usually
                    expressed in less visible ways? It would be interesting to explore the longer term impact of the
                    Klan on rural Indiana.</p>

                    the the Depression families continued old patterns of neighborhood interdependence, exemplified in
                    trading, sharing, and working together. Although rural Hoosiers expressed concern for neighbors who

            <p>Accounts of World War II centered on relatives in the service and the consequences of gas, tire,
                    sugar, and shoe rationing. Depending on their own needs, neighbors often traded ration stamps with
                    one another. In spite of shortages, the war, some recalled, did bring economic recovery through
                    expanded farm production and availability of new jobs. These jobs often drew women from rural
                    communities, and several interviewees echoed William Chafe's thesis that World War II was a
                    major turning point for American women: "many of them didn't go back to being just
                    homemakers after the war. They just kept on with their jobs. They had learned that they could do

                    with mothers and sisters; what were their courting rituals?</p>
            <p>Among the many glimpses of life that are documented in <hi rend="i">Girlhood Days,</hi> some of the
                    most illuminating are those which examine gender roles on the farm, attitudes toward school, and
                    health conditions. Families described were large, and the children, like their colonial and
                    nineteenth-century rural predecessors, still labored on the family farm. Many spoke of performing
                    farm and house chores by the time they were seven. Such tasks included collecting eggs, feeding
                    chickens, filling and hauling water buckets, carrying wood, gardening, and assisting with baking and
                        washing.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> Whether or not girls undertook other farm tasks depended largely
                    on the sexual composition of the family and the attitudes of the father. Assignments based on gender
                    may have irritated some girls, who as elderly women still recalled their exclusion from certain
                    jobs. Although some girls milked cows and helped in the fields (especially when there were not
                    "near as many boys as there was girls" in the family), other fathers refused to
                    let their daughters perform what they considered "male only" tasks. "My
                    father was one of those," a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lagrange County</region>

                    He was very strict about that. We would beg to work." Another father constantly reminded
                    his daughters, " `Your place is to help your mother, and I don't want you out
                    around here, with the stock.'" One farmer, willing to let his daughter work as a
                    field hand, felt more comfortable giving her a male nickname: "My dad had no boys and he
                    always called me Tommy. The other three girls worked in the kitchen and around there, but I always
                    helped feed the horses and hogs and do things like that… . And he called me
                        Tommy."<hi rend="sup">52</hi> Fulfilling male work roles, however, did not reduce
                    traditional female responsibilities: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    to use the washboard," another recalled, "I lots of time stayed home on wash day,
                    because with that big a family, there was lots of washing." During the months of December,
                    January, and February, boys came back to school from the farm, "So during those months
                    we'd have quite a little rowdiness in school much of the time." One woman whose
                    parents hired people rather than keeping their children out of school recalled that her family was
                    the exception: "We didn't hardly ever have to stay home to work. A lot of children
                    did have to, but Dad and Mom never were like that."<hi rend="sup">54</hi> Although most
                    school memories focused on one-room schoolhouses, many women explained how few children attended
                    school beyond their graduation from eighth grade: "A lot of students didn't go to
                    high school in those days. Not because they couldn't pass the test, but because there were
                    no school buses and if they lived in the country they had no access to high school
                    facilities." Transportation difficulties alone did not account for the termination of
                    schooling: "What was the use of going to school?" a <placeName>

            <p>"Growing up Healthy" is an ironic title for a chapter that offers a litany of the
                    diseases contracted by interviewees or by family members. Typhoid, diptheria, smallpox,
                    tuberculosis, rheumatic fever, diarrhea, whooping cough, influenza, and pneumonia, as well as
                    serious farm accidents, punctuate homemakers' accounts. Rural Indiana was not exceptional
                    in this regard, however; for despite considerable progress made in the treatment of several diseases
                    between 1890 and 1920, by the 1930s, "On farms across the land, the birthrate was still
                    high, the average length of life still low, [and] the `old-fashioned' diseases still
                    appallingly prevalent."<hi rend="sup">56</hi> Hoosier women recalled a variety of home
                    remedies, and from the comments about some of the doctors, patients probably had as much chance of
                    recovery with a home remedy as with a doctor. One Lawrence County mother correctly diagnosed her
                    daughter as a victim of "infantile paralysis, because there had been some cases <list type="footnotes">

                            education" law was passed in 1897, but according to the Lynds, the law only
                            required twelve weeks of consecutive attendance per year from ages eight to fourteen.
                            "Until 1924 the upper age limit for required school attendance was
                            fourteen." They also noted that high school attendance in the state increased
                            dramatically from 1920 to 1924. Robert S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd, <hi rend="i">

                    just worms, and he doctored her for worms." Questions of competence aside, without
                    antibiotics and with inoculations for only a few diseases, country doctors in many cases could do
                    little for their patients. Moreover, while many rural families delayed contacting doctors, some
                    explained that they were "often scarce and you just couldn't get one."<hi rend="sup">57</hi> Travel for rural families remained extremely difficult, and many perceived
                    hospitals as distant places where one went to die. It is not surprising that home remedies,
                    relatives, and neighbors were anchors in times of sickness. "Whenever any of the neighbor
                    men would get sick, the neighbors would all pitch in," one woman said.
                    "They'd go and help put out the crops, or help to gather them in, or whatever
                    needed doing. If the women would get down sick, we'd go in and take them things and help
                    out every which way we could."<hi rend="sup">58</hi> Serious illness drew the neighbors
                    together; "When somebody was sick, we had no hospital here … the men always came
                    and sat up at night."<hi rend="sup">59</hi>

                    influence of Progressive faith in science, efficiency, and expertise; and the significance of

                        "<hi rend="i">Just a Housewife</hi>" that by 1900 the first professional home
                    economists sought "to distance themselves from that lowly amateur, the housewife,"
                    and to set standards by which "actual practice would be measured." She concludes
                    that the promotion of standards meant that women had to be taught "not to trust their own
                    tastes" but instead to rely on experts and to "despise tradition and …
                    advice of older women." The only way to escape tradition and effect change was

                            science, these women copied male professions and, unlike Beecher, who extolled the virtues
                            of homemakers, denigrated the competence of women as homemakers. "Themselves women
                            who were having to contend with invidious stereotypes of female nature and female abilities
                            in the academy and workplace, many of the pioneer home economists internalized the

                    Lever Act, land grant colleges established networks of cooperative extension courses for women, and
                    in 1923 the Bureau of Home Economics was created in the Department of Agriculture.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The underlying assumptions of home economics as a discipline are apparent in the formation of the
                    Indiana home economics clubs. These clubs were organized for the purpose of enlightening rural
                    homemakers through lessons and demonstrations. Purdue University home economists, revered by the
                    homemakers, traveled around the state giving presentations in schools or courthouses to groups
                    composed of representatives from the local "home ec" clubs. The local women would
                    then take the practical advice back to women in their own communities. As club membership grew,
                    women lobbied their county officials to contribute funds for a full-time home economics agent in
                    each county.<hi rend="sup">62</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt that lessons "to improve, enlarge and endear the greatest institution in
                    the world—THE HOME" helped alter rural homemaking methods in early
                    twentieth-century Indiana.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> Hoosier women were encouraged to rely on the
                    experts and to give up their old ways in order to become better homemakers. In the beginning, a
                    homemaker recalled, most club members were "farm women and they had no education in
                    developing their sewing and cooking, and I think it was the most wonderful thing that ever
                        happened."<hi rend="sup">64</hi> Since mothers of these farm women had presumably run
                    homes without "education" in homemaking, comments like this indicate that many
                    accepted the assumption that they needed special training.</p>
            <p>Judging from the number of references, some of the most valued lessons were those on cold packing and
                    canning food, but these lessons reveal another dimension of home economics: if the home-maker
                    herself were to use the new methods, she would need a cold packer and a pressure cooker of her own.
                    As previously noted, clubs offered lessons promoting electricity and the benefits of particular
                    electrical products. There were also lessons on the benefits of packaged foods and mixes. Although
                    the published testimony indicates that women were generally receptive to new methods and products,
                    there were probably some who were not convinced. <list type="footnotes">

                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">62</hi> One former agent recalled that visiting every club four or five
                            times a year mushroomed into an impossible task when the number of clubs increased from five
                            to twenty-eight. Ironically, extension agents were forced to remain unmarried. Since
                            homemaking was presented as a full-time profession, "when you got married, you quit
                            work. You weren't expected to work in Extension after you were married."
                            This policy changed only after World War II when single women were difficult to recruit and
                            when more married women were working. <hi rend="i">Going to Club.</hi> 61.</item>

                    advantages of new technologies for simplifying homemaking tasks and thus both implicitly and
                    explicitly promoting consumerism has continued for over seven decades. Rather than the advantages of
                    pressure cookers and electric irons, for example, contemporary lessons have praised the benefits of
                    microwaves and home computers.</p>
            <p>A review of the lessons over this period offers social historians abundant evidence of the impact of
                    change on rural and smalltown women in Indiana. Initially concentrated primarily on food or clothing
                    demonstrations and geared to women who did not work outside the home, lessons in more recent years
                    have focused on a wider range of topics, "We have human development … and we
                    have lessons on aging and wills, banking, women living alone, insurance, social
                    security—all things we never used to get into in Extension Lessons." Because
                    planning was originally premised on the assumption that homemakers had only one job, "more
                    lessons for career women that go hand in hand with homemaking" have been offered since
                    World War II. "Lots of us are working outside the home," a woman in her thirties
                    explained, "and budgeting our time has been of prime importance in our lesson
                        discussions."<hi rend="sup">66</hi> The changing nature of the lessons indicates the
                    pragmatic orientation of extension and its willingness over the decades to deal with contemporary
                    concerns of rural women.</p>
            <p>Quite apart from whatever practical benefits women derived from the lessons, the clubs were
                    enormously important in strengthening neighborliness. Historians have examined nineteenth- and early
                    twentieth-century associational activities for urban women and have written extensively about
                    sisterhood, bonds between women, and women's networks in urban areas,67 but historical

                        <p>Farm women had never had an opportunity to join clubs. And, for many of the women, the social
                            part of it was worth more to them than anything else. It was worthwhile for that, just to
                            get women out and let them know that there was somebody else that had the same problems they
                                did.<hi rend="sup">68</hi>

                    </quote> Many women undoubtedly went to club just because they "wanted someplace to
                    go"; others joined because "everybody else in the community belonged and it was
                    the best of women … ." With the dearth of other activities, "our club
                    meetings and our church were the highlights of our lives, and everybody went." For new
                    residents joining a club was "a good way to get to know people around the
                    neighborhood." Without it, one woman "wouldn't have known
                    anybody." The women were "so friendly. You just felt that you was in a jolly
                    bunch… . I felt right at home with all of them."<hi rend="sup">69</hi>

            <p>For the first decades, clubs met during the day, often with children in attendance, but after World
                    War II some clubs began meeting at night, reflecting employed women's new jobs. Not only
                    were more women working outside the home, but there was also "electricity in more than just
                    a few houses"; and with improved transportation, "we were becoming more mobile.
                    Women weren't afraid to go out at night alone."<hi rend="sup">70</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether attending day or evening meetings, members emphasized to families their determination not to
                    miss these occasions. Club night became known in many families as "Mom's night
                    out!! And you didn't do something that interfered with it. They took care of themselves at
                    home. That was always my time and my family respected it. That was the <hi rend="i">one</hi> thing
                    that Mom did." Family members did not object when women went out because, "To tell
                    the truth, it wouldn't of done them much good." In order to take time out for the
                    day meetings, women often worked harder in the evening to make up for the lost time. Since many
                    children attended the day meetings, they grew up together and also formed special friendships
                    through the clubs: "There was about as many children as there were women and that was a big
                    deal to get to go play with all the children on club day," a woman recalled. With or
                    without children present, women were faithful members because the "fellowship <list type="footnotes">

            <p>In addition to sisterhood, club activities offered women an opportunity to develop leadership skills
                    and increase self-confidence. The responsibility of bringing a lesson back to the club forced some
                    women to speak in front of others for the first time. "I remember the first lesson I
                    took," a <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Whitley County</region>
                    </placeName> woman stated. "I came home with a headache and worried about how I was going
                    to give that lesson." Overcoming her "shaking and quivering" when she
                    made a speech, one member was never again "bothered in front of people."
                    "By receiving lessons from Purdue specialists," a former state president
                    explained, "it helped me to have confidence in myself and to branch out into other
                    community organizations."<hi rend="sup">72</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Special club activities provided some women with extraordinary experiences; for example, several
                    clubs and state groups took field trips to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
               </placeName>, and other
                    cities to tour museums or attend artistic performances. But travels by the Indiana Homemakers Chorus
                    in the 1930s were most notable. Club choruses throughout the state joined to form the Indiana
                    Homemakers Chorus, or "Singing Hoosiers," with approximately two thousand voices
                    and performed at the Hollywood Bowl, the International Exposition in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Toronto</settlement>, <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>

                    D. Roosevelt at a White House lawn party. After entertaining him with "`Home on the
                    Range,' because it was such a favorite of his," the women were greeted by the
                    first lady.</p>

                    </placeName> as part of the French Louisiana Colony. By the 1930s, few living reminders of the
                    city's French past remained, and only a few septuagenarians and octogenarians of French
                    descent remembered old French songs and stories.</p>
            <p>About fifteen years ago, folklorist Ronald L. Baker found an unpublished Works Progress
                    Administration (WPA) Federal Writers' Project manuscript from 1937 entitled "The

                    </placeName>, three chapters detailed French customs, songs, and stories as written down by WPA

                    and folktales (the titles of his second, third, and fourth chapters). In addition, the book contains

                    sources (mostly in English) relating to French-language folklore and folk songs. Baker's

                    </placeName> drawn from other sources, some of which are dated, leading the author to repeat several

            <p>The second chapter is an accurate, colorful, and valuable account of the material culture of the

            <p>Reading the pages of another person's diary can be as entertaining and informative as
                    listening in on a party-line phone, and if the diary's pages encompass a major world event
                    the reader's experience adds up to time and money well spent. Frank W. Peyton's
                        <hi rend="i">A Surgeon's Diary</hi> provides such an experience.</p>
            <p>The major world event covered is the Italian campaign of World War II and its North African and
                    Sicilian preludes. The first Allied offensive in North Africa commenced in November, 1942, with the
                    landing of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName>. It was in Oran, <placeName>
                        <country reg="ae">Algeria</country>
                    </placeName>, in February, 1943, that Dr. Peyton's overseas experience with the 15th
                    Evacuation Hospital began. The hospital moved forward with the advancing army into Tunis, across the
                    Mediterranean Sea to Sicily, and then into <placeName>
                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>
                    </placeName>, starting with the bloody experience of Anzio. The diary ends in Milan in September,
                    1945, following the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> surrender.</p>
            <p>The unique perspective of <hi rend="i">A Surgeon's Diary is that the war is not seen with
                        the usual dropping of bombs, the destruction of ships, and the shooting down of airplanes, nor
                        from the front line with advancing tanks and infantry. Rather one sees the very personal point
                        of view of a military hospital's admitting and treating physician, whose agonizing
                        tasks were to receive the living victims of war's instruments of carnage, to make
                        decisions, and to do whatever possible to provide relief and save life. The hours were long, but
                        the work was as gratifying as it was agonizing.</hi>

                    medical training, however, was that of a physician and surgeon, which was the way he spent his three
                    years in the army. His intensive basic training, before shipping out with the 15th Evacuation
                    Hospital, involved treatment of shock and recognition of irretrievable shock.</p>
            <p>One of the interesting aspects of the narrative is the remarkable effect produced by penicillin when
                    it first became available during the Italian campaign. But <hi rend="i">A Surgeon's
                    Diary</hi> reveals that daily activity was not all war. Peyton tells the fun side of life under
                    adverse circumstances, and, overall, leaves the reader with a feeling of appreciation for being a
                    civilian living in a time of peace.</p>

                    communities" (p. iv).</p>
            <p>Donald M. Royer describes his project as a "socio-historical study … to explain

                    </placeName> settlers" (p. 1). He seeks to answer where in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> they lived, what the conditions were that led to their emigration, why they chose the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> area, and what their role in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s development since the early decades of the nineteenth century has been.</p>
            <p>Despite these claims and the amount of research which led to the publication, however, the work is
                    unsatisfying. One is uncertain, for instance, why the years 1833–1933 were selected.
                    Granted, the first <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> family arrived in 1833, but the number of Germans remained small until the mid-1840s,
                    when the first two churches were established. The ending date is also unexplained. The author,
                    moreover, provides neither systematic nor thorough examination of the questions he raises. Instead,
                    he spends much of the text discussing the reasons for persons leaving <pb n="227" id="VAA4025-086-2-103"/> the Osnabruck region and settling in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>—0104 in the 1850s—and offers some useful material in the process.
                    He argues that most <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> Germans came from the area but does not explain why Germans from other regions
                    apparently avoided <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Only about one-fifth of the text deals with the period after 1900. Acculturation and
                    assimilation, therefore, are neither clearly defined nor adequately developed. At one point the
                    author asserts that World War I was the most important cause of what he terms assimilation; but the
                    point is undeveloped, and evidence on the next page (p. 94) suggests that other forces were at least
                    as important and had been at work long before 1917.</p>
            <p>There are also problems with sources and organization. Documentation is largely provided through
                    local genealogical and antiquarian sources and excludes such vital materials as the manuscript
                    census and recent historical studies of immigration and ethnicity in American history. While
                    sections dealing with persons leaving Osnabruck is fairly well organized, systematic
                    analysis—especially in the latter portions of the text—is lacking. There is no
                    conclusion, and the appendix, which provides details of some <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> families, is unrelated to the text.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the chief limitation here is the quality of historical analysis. One is certainly aware of
                    the need to appreciate the contributions of immigrant groups to American society, but history is
                    more than this. One needs to know whether the experiences of Germans in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> were unique, for instance, and how other ethnic groups fared in the Rose City. One
                    would also appreciate an examination of such issues as prohibition, sabbath laws, and parochial
                    schools. For the most part, this is a genealogical and antiquarian effort. It needs to be more.</p>

                    Edited by Frederick D. Williams. (East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 1989. Pp. xiv, 142.

            <p>For historians of the Old Northwest, 1987 was a busy year. Besides planning celebrations for the two
                    hundredth anniversary of the Constitution, these scholars observed what Philip R. Shriver has called
                    "the other bicentennial"—that of the Northwest Ordinance. On campuses
                    large and small students of that historic document <pb n="228" id="VAA4025-086-2-104"/> gathered to
                    reassess its provisions and the governmental structure it created for the frontier north of the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Northwest Ordinance,</hi> edited by Frederick D. Williams, contains the papers
                    delivered at one such conference held at Michigan State University. Focusing on issues involved in
                    "securing and peopling the Old Northwest" (p. x) and on the development of
                    education in the region, the essays reflect the common theme of the ordinance's ambiguous
                    nature.</p>
            <p>Two papers directly treat this topic. In his keynote address, Jack N. Rakove labels the Ordinance an
                    "ambiguous achievement," for despite the stated intent of the third Article to
                    treat the Indians with "utmost good faith," the document was in fact "a
                    legal facade for the expropriation of Indian land" (p. 2). To fathom this and other
                    "inherent ambiguities of the Ordinance" requires, in Rakove's view,
                    finding a balance between its lofty principles and the "mundane motives" of its
                    framers (p. 3.) It also means recognizing that the flood of western settlement before the Revolution
                    prompted the political issues that demanded Congress's attention in 1787, that the
                    Constitution actually saved the Ordinance from being "little more than a dead
                    letter" (p. 13), and that the noble aspirations expressed in Article III were in fact
                    mocked by the tragic realities confronted by the Amerindians. Here the Ordinance's
                    ambiguity bore bitter fruit, for "one people's liberty was another
                    people's loss" (p. 18).</p>
            <p>Paul Finkelman examines the question of ambiguity in analyzing the relationship between slavery and
                    the Ordinance. In a superbly documented effort, Finkelman demonstrates that although Article VI set
                    the stage for eventual elimination of slavery, it was no emancipation proclamation; instead, he says
                    it was a hastily drafted eleventh-hour addition and an "example of <hi rend="i">how not
                    to</hi> draft a statute" (p. 76). It symbolized the ambiguous legacy of the Ordinance by
                    declaring an end to slavery while at the same time protecting the property rights of slaveowners.</p>
            <p>The remaining essays consider three diverse elements of the Ordinance's formulation and
                    legacy. Gordon T. Stewart cogently argues that the Northwest Ordinance should be seen in the context
                    of the balance of power between British, Spanish, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> interests. Given this struggle, America's "optimistic"
                    leaders, Stewart states, believed that the Ordinance would assist in procuring settler allegiance to

                    </placeName>. In a probing analysis of Protestant missionary efforts in the Old Northwest, Ruth H.
                    Bloch insightfully treats the role of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> Congregationalists in countering a "creeping infidelity," prompted,
                    in their eyes, by the French Revolution. Finally, Jurgen Herbst tells the story of public higher
                    education. He concentrates on the early fragility of the universities, their struggle "to
                    avoid accusations of sectarianism and godlessness" (p. 104), and their reactions to demands
                        <pb n="229" id="VAA4025-086-2-105"/> for "practical" education. While
                    providing helpful historical data, Herbst fails to explain adequately the connections between the
                    provisions and legacy of the Ordinance and these educational developments.</p>
            <p>There is little that is genuinely new in this book, but its contributors furnish some perceptive
                    material. Finkelman's explanation of why southern congressmen supported Article VI is, for
                    example, highly penetrating, as is Stewart's comparison of the strategic importance of the
                    Old Northwest with that of the present-day Middle East. Likewise, Bloch's discussion of
                    Congregationalist desires to spread "the true faith of the growing republic" (p.
                    42) suggests a fresh area of investigation for students of civil religion. In short, this slim
                    volume demonstrates the historiographic value of academe's celebration of "the
                    other bicentennial."</p>

               <hi rend="i">The American Backwoods Frontier</hi> is an exploration in historical geography that
                    seeks to identify the ethnic and ecological origins of America's frontier woodland culture.
                    Terry G. Jordan and Matti Kaups rely on diverse documentary sources as well as observations of
                    remnant artifacts at original locations and in open air museums. Prior to beginning this book, <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> believed that the structural skills and architectural concepts necessary for a rapidly
                    advancing woodland frontier were to be found in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> lands of Central Europe. An absence of supportive field evidence in this area and
                    subsequently encouraging observations in Scandinavia led to him to adopt a new hypothesis. He became
                    convinced that log architecture and fencing, as well as other practices associated with
                    America's woodland frontier, originated among Finnish settlers who migrated from interior <placeName>

                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>

            <p>The resulting book begins with a brief overview of the frontier way of life and a reminder that
                    American woodland settlement advanced most rapidly beyond the Midland or Delaware Valley culture
                    hearth. The second chapter presents the authors' primary hypothesis: "the eastern,
                    interior Finns of Karelian and Savoan background, bearers of a well-developed, beautifully
                    preadapted forest colonization cultural complex, were the most significant <pb n="[230]" id="VAA4025-086-2-106"/>

                    existence of nearly identical cultural traits among the first European settlers of

                    and hunting and gathering practices; and presenting surname and place name occurrences that support

                    than plausible. Excellent graphics depicting the recurring presence of the same material culture
                    traits in northern Europe and interior America effectively reinforce their argument. The
                    Savo-Karelian immigrants are convincingly presented as an adaptable group of settlers with a
                    venerable European woodland frontier heritage. Their early arrival in the Delaware Valley and rapid
                    dispersal to isolated sites in the forest contrasted with the more gregarious, slowly advancing,

                    thesis. They admit that information describing frontier culture in and near the Delaware Valley is
                    sketchy. They also acknowledge a dearth of concrete evidence that later arriving and considerably
                    more numerous Scots-Irish frontiersmen willingly adopted a way of life followed by a few scattered
                    Finns. Nor can essential prior borrowing of Delaware Indian traits by the Savo-Karelians be fully
                    documented. Even with these shortcomings, this provocative and clearly written monograph will hold
                    the attention of any reader who has an interest in American frontier history.</p>

            <p>Despite the flood of Reconstruction studies appearing over the past several decades and a substantial
                    shelf of works already devoted to the enigmatic Andrew Johnson, historians have long needed a
                    modern, balanced biography of the seventeenth president. <pb n="232" id="VAA4025-086-2-108"/> In
                    this well-researched, carefully argued, and solidly written book, Hans L. Trefousse fills this
                    important gap in the historical literature of the middle period.</p>
            <p>Better than any previous biographer, Trefousse has separated fact from fiction in reexamining
                    Johnson's hardscrabble boyhood in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, his migration to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, his success as a tailor, and his meteoric rise to prominence in local, state, and
                    national politics. A powerful orator with a consistently populist appeal, Johnson was equally
                    skillful at playing the dangerous game of divide-and-conquer to advance his career. Ostensibly a
                    Democrat, he nevertheless often quarreled with the leaders of the Tennessee Democracy and worked
                    with dissident Whigs when the need arose. By 1860, a principled commitment to Unionism, combined
                    with intense ambition, drove him strongly to oppose secession, a decision that won Johnson both
                    acclaim and derision throughout the country.</p>
            <p>If success in politics often depends on timing, Johnson had chosen the right moment to command the
                    national stage. Admiring his courage and natural political abilities, Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> rewarded Johnson accordingly: first with control of federal patronage in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, next with appointment as military governor of that state, and finally with the Union
                    party's 1864 vice-presidential nomination.</p>
            <p>Although Trefousse has written several books on the Radical Republicans and does not sympathize with
                    Johnson's views on reconstruction and race, he presents a remarkably evenhanded account of
                    the presidential years by paying careful attention to the intricacies of chronology, personality,
                    and factional infighting. Johnson could never transcend the limits of his Jacksonian ideology, but
                    Trefousse refuses to turn this well-known stubborness into a caricature. Johnson's sincere
                    and sometimes magisterial commitment to the Union and the Constitution receives full attention; and
                    the rich analysis of the Republican opposition does not gloss over weaknesses of either character or
                    judgment. Even though Trefousse avoids becoming embroiled in the persistent controversies of
                    Reconstruction historiography, he implicitly departs from the neo-revisionist interpretations of
                    Harold Hyman and Michael Les Benedict by approaching the impeachment question in a manner more akin
                    to the mildly revisionist views of Eric McKitrick.</p>
            <p>Andrew Johnson, of course, poses formidable difficulties for a conscientious biographer. Trefousse
                    analyzes Johnson's family life and character, but available evidence simply will not
                    support a complete and compelling portrait of this obviously driven but curiously elusive
                    personality. Thus despite Trefousse's thoughtful attempt to explain why Johnson waited so
                    long before trying to remove Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, this strange episode may forever remain
                    inexplicable. The only real weakness in the book is <pb n="233" id="VAA4025-086-2-109"/> the
                    author's rigid adherence to chronology, which sometimes leads to the sudden introduction of
                    topics that are just as quickly dropped and repetitiously picked up later. This makes for some
                    awkward transitions and is especially annoying in the discussion of Johnson's advocacy of
                    homestead legislation. All in all, however, Trefousse has written a superior
                    biography—one that should remain the standard work on Andrew Johnson for some time.</p>

            <p>This volume contains nothing new concerning the frontier, the union, or Stephen A. Douglas. It is a
                    collection of earlier works by Robert W. Johannsen, dating from the 1950s through a lecture
                    delivered in 1986. Part I consists of four essays concerning the Pacific Northwest frontier from
                    1848 through the Civil War; Part II is comprised of six essays which present different aspects of
                    Douglas's career; Part III provides four essays on the vision of Abraham <placeName>

                    </placeName>; Part IV is a lone essay describing the "Young America" spirit of
                    mid-nineteenth-century America.</p>
            <p>Although thirteen of the fifteen essays were previously published, having them all together in one
                    volume provides a clear picture of the Douglas whom historians frequently ignore: the visionary who
                    believed that popular sovereignty was a constitutional right of territorial residents, not merely a
                    pragmatic way to avoid the question of slavery. As late as 1860 he claimed that "popular
                    sovereignty was the single, crucial issue of the campaign" (p. 166). The eleventh essay,
                    "In Search of the Real <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s struggle to define "equality." The Douglas essays in Part
                    II indicate that Douglas had equal difficulty in finding a universally acceptable definition of
                    "popular sovereignty." In his preface, Johannsen suggests that although the
                    martyred <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> has come to be revered "as a representative American … a better
                    case might be made for Douglas" (p. xvii). Both the content and the placement vis-$aG-vis
                    one another of these essays builds on that theme.</p>
            <p>The fourteenth essay, "Sandburg and <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>

                    </placeName>'s life as "the life of the people" (p. 280). The following

            <p>Some repetition of material is unavoidable. Generally this is not bothersome, but careful editing of
                    material that has been fully covered in earlier essays could lessen reading time. Reading any of
                    these essays, however, is time well spent. They clearly demonstrate that the popular view of the

                    </placeName>'s ultimate commitment was to union or to liberty" (p. xv). One would

                    also limit the book's usefulness to the general public. Though organizers hoped to make it

            <p>The Spanish-American War of 1898 represented a turning point in America's relationship with
                    the rest of the world. It foreshadowed the <placeName>

                    </placeName>' expanding role in international affairs in the twentieth century and
                    represented a new national self-confidence. Curtis V. Hard's personal account of the war,
                        <hi rend="i">Banners in the Air,</hi> captures the enthusiasm and patriotism of thousands of
                    National Guardsmen who rushed to join the colors after the sinking of the <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName>
                    </hi> in Havana Harbor. Robert H. Ferrell recently discovered Hard's unpublished manuscript
                    in the archives of the Western Reserve Historical Society and has done a masterful job of editing
                    the journal.</p>
            <p>As commander of the 8th Ohio Volunteers, Hard led his men from mobilization in Ohio to eventual
                    deployment in <placeName>
                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                    </placeName>, where they arrived too late for action at Santiago. Nonetheless, 72 of the <pb n="236" id="VAA4025-086-2-112"/> 1,325 men in his command perished from malaria before they could be
                    removed and quarantined at Montauk Point on Long Island. Despite the fact that the 8th Ohio saw no
                    combat, Hard's account is filled with interesting personal observations about important
                    personalities and operations of the expedition. He records both his disgust with the crusty and
                    often profane commander of the campaign, General William R. Shafter, and his sympathy for General
                    Nelson A. Miles, commanding general of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Army, who was passed over for command in <placeName>
                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                    </placeName> and given the lesser job of occupying <placeName>
                        <country reg="pr">Puerto Rico</country>
                    </placeName>. His own second in command, Lieutenant Colonel Charles W. F. Dick, was then secretary
                    of the Republican National Committee and later, while a member of the <placeName>

                    support for state National Guards and formalized their relationship with the regular army.</p>
            <p>Hard's prose is easy to follow and his observations, perhaps reflecting his midwestern
                    upbringing, are refreshingly direct and concise. He was proud of his regiment and his state and
                    entered service with the same carefree attitude as his men. Before long, however, the Ohioans saw
                    their romantic notions of war collide with unpleasant realities of disease in the Caribbean and the
                    muddled attempts of the War Department to cope with the rapid expansion of the army. The rush to get
                    to <placeName>
                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                    </placeName> and the front was followed in short order by a corresponding rush to get back to
                    America and home.</p>
            <p>Ferrell has done an admirable job in editing Hard's journal and has added an introduction
                    and conclusion, a complete roster of the regiment, eleven pages of notes, a bibliography on the war
                    itself, and a number of previously unpublished photographs of the 8th Ohio in 1898. <hi rend="i">Banners in the Air</hi> provides an interesting and readable eyewitness account of

            <p>American historians have usually assumed that while both apathy and opposition to the Great War
                    existed—especially outside the urban Northeast—most citizens eventually came
                    to support the nation's participation. Christopher C. Gibbs argues, however, that
                    "the great silent majority" of Missourians opposed involvement <pb n="237" id="VAA4025-086-2-113"/> throughout the war "by slacking when possible, resisting where
                    necessary, and going along when no other course of action was available" (p. 156).</p>
            <p>Gibbs refutes those critics who accused the war's opponents of being pacifists, pro-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName>, or political radicals. Pacifism, he contends, did not have deep roots in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, and while significant numbers of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName>-Americans and Italian-Americans lived in the state, opposition to mobilization cannot
                    "be explained by ethnicity alone" (p. 43). Nor does radicalism (Socialists were
                    the most organized opponents) account for the widespread resistance. Rather, opposition emerged from
                    longtime political and economic traditions, particularly "localism, faith in democracy, and
                    anticorporate sentiment" (p. 41). The dominant theme of opponents, according to Gibbs, was
                    that "Wall Street bankers, arms dealers, [and] food speculators … wanted war
                    because they would get richer while the common people paid in money and blood" (p. 43).</p>
            <p>Gibbs's monograph is based on several collections, including the papers of the Missouri
                    Council of Defense, as well as about three dozen state newspapers. His chapter on the council is
                    most interesting and tends to confirm similar research on other states. Created by
                    "bankers, businessmen, and state officials" (p. 50), the Missouri council became
                    like a "private club" in which "workers, blacks, and women were hardly
                    represented at all" (pp. 53, 52). Its purpose was to mobilize the state as it tried to
                    eliminate dissent. The impetus to suppress dissent, according to Gibbs, came not from the grass
                    roots but from businessmen, public officials, and the press.</p>
            <p>The major difficulty with this work stems from documenting the extent of opposition to the war.
                    Newspapers, as the author acknowledges, pose problems because they usually denied dissenters a forum
                    and as a result, news coverage and editorials leave the impression of widespread support for the
                    war. Still, Gibbs says, "a careful reading of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>'s press uncovers a second level of news" that mentions slackers and
                    lack of support for mobilization (p. 28). Gibbs also uses evidence from the mobilizers themselves to
                    show that their campaigns often did not meet their own criteria for success. Interestingly, he notes
                    that only 3.8 percent of Missourians participated in the second Liberty Loan drive and less than 11
                    percent in the third, compared to the national averages of 10 and 18 percent respectively. Still,
                    this reviewer remains skeptical that opposition was as pervasive as the author claims.</p>
            <p>But this reservation is one of degree and should not obscure the fact that this book goes beyond John
                    C. Crighton's <hi rend="i">Missouri and the World War, 1914–1917</hi> (1947) in
                    adding to an understanding of the homefront during the war. It is a nice contribution to the recent
                    literature that has examined mobilization at the state <pb n="238" id="VAA4025-086-2-114"/> and
                    local levels. Students of twentieth-century American nationalism will find this book valuable, too,
                    as an example of how the federal government increased its presence in the lives of citizens.</p>

            <p>The essays in this volume focus on the foremost mass-production industry in the twentieth century.
                    Edited by Nelson Lichtenstein and Stephen Meyer, with contributions by sociologists, historians,
                    industrial relations experts, and economists, the essays illuminate the dynamics of the labor
                    process, assess the character of shop-floor relations, and evaluate the relative power of workers
                    and managers to control the structure and organization of work.</p>
            <p>Wayne Lewchuk argues that the organization and militance of skilled metal workers in Britain (but not
                    in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>) precluded the imposition there of Fordism's machine-paced production and
                    close supervision. Thomas Klug discusses the various strategies used by auto employers to control
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> labor market, which further enhanced the ability of American managers to shape
                    production in the preunion era. Tracing the social history of machine tool design and technical
                    innovation in the industry from the 1900s to the 1950s, Meyer argues that Fordism was flexible
                    enough to accommodate semispecial and automated machines and challenges scholars who hail the recent
                    rise of an allegedly new system of flexible specialization that will reskill—not deskill
                    or degrade—labor. Steve Jefferys shows how radicalized workers at the Dodge Main plant in
                    Hamtramck, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, in the 1930s established a strong shop-floor tradition that legitimized sectional
                    bargaining and industrial action, in stark contrast to the situation that prevailed in General
                    Motors plants. Asking why women were not retained on production jobs after World War II, Ruth
                    Milkman argues that Fordism's emphasis on high wages offered auto managers no incentive to
                    substitute women for men and that management's hiring policies, not union inaction or
                    collusion, determined the composition of the postwar automotive labor force. Lichtenstein assesses
                    the brief history of auto foremen's unionism and speculates on the relationship of the
                    "man in the middle" to the formation of working-class identity and consciousness
                    at midcentury. Stephen Amberg offers an historical perspective on the contemporary transformation of
                    the auto industry in an analysis of Studebaker <pb n="239" id="VAA4025-086-2-115"/> baker in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, arguing the importance of union politics to the successful implementation of flexible
                    specialization and the very survival of American manufacturing. Steven Tolliday and Jonathan Zeitlin
                    are less ingenuous and point to the ambiguous character of labor's power, comparing British
                    and American auto workers and the history of collective bargaining since the 1930s.</p>
            <p>Although the quality of the essays is mixed and uneven, the best of them represent the cutting edge
                    of scholarship, particularly insofar as labor history since the 1930s is concerned. The collection
                    as a whole is rich in insight, provocative (and often effective) in argument, and a useful addition
                    to the literature on unionism and the work process in the twentieth century.</p>

            <p>"In the past, the man has been first," proclaimed Frederick Winslow Taylor in 1911;
                    "in the future the system must be first" (p. 188). Four years later the French
                    painter Francis Picabia wrote that in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, "the machine has become more than a mere adjunct of human life. It is really
                    a part of human life—perhaps the very soul" (p. 330). With Taylor, Picabia saw
                    "the machine" promoting efficiency, gigantic scale, and hierarchical organization
                    in modern culture. The promise of American technological systems to foster a new civilization spread
                    through the Western imagination like no other utopian ideal since the French Revolution, cutting
                    across national and ideological boundaries. By the 1930s, Joseph Stalin would point to the enormous
                    steel complex at Magnitogorsk as a socialist Gary, Indiana, the fulfillment of his early claim that
                    "the combination of Russian revolutionary sweep with American efficiency is the essence of
                    Leninism" (p. 251).</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">American Genesis,</hi> the eminent historian of technology Thomas P. Hughes describes
                    the revolution in systems-building as the most significant contribution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to twentieth-century culture. Like his hero Lewis Mumford, Hughes believes that the
                    history of technology is essentially cultural history and that "technology is both a shaper
                    of, and is shaped by, values" (p. 5). Hughes's synthetic narrative of
                    "technological enthusiasm" between 1870 and 1970 has two central themes: first,
                    the incorporation <pb n="240" id="VAA4025-086-2-116"/> of invention at the turn of the century as
                    the loose, quasi-Bohemian culture of early inventors came under the sway of corporate industry; and
                    second, the diffusion of values and symbols of order, precision, and systematic control from
                    technology to politics and culture.</p>
            <p>Hughes's book reaches its climax when it covers the period between 1919 and 1945, as
                    "Taylorismus and Fordismus" inspired Americans and Europeans alike with a
                    "white socialism" of mass production and consumption overseen by engineers (p.
                    289). Hughes brilliantly demonstrates that it was European Modernists, Weimar social democrats, and
                    Soviet revolutionaries who laid the groundwork for American social planning in the 1930s and the
                    military-industrial complex of the 1940s by translating technics into artistic form and political
                    ideology. But the culminating creations of that enterprise—the Tennessee Valley Authority
                    and the Manhattan Project—also set the stage for the disillusionment with "The
                    System" during the 1960s. Hughes concludes with a survey of the ideas of Jacques Ellul,
                    Mumford, and other theorists of technological dystopia. Despite the Reagan administration's
                    hope of salvation through Star Wars, Hughes asserts that the revolutionary enthusiasm for American
                    technological systems has ended.</p>
            <p>Hughes's masterful study of this critical moment in Western culture interweaves elegant
                    portraits of American inventors and systems-builders with its overarching theory of the dialectic of
                    technics and civilization. At times, however, this synthesis comes undone. Some chapters veer
                    between overly technical discussions of scientific matters and summary statements about the culture
                    of technology that lack grounding in other relevant developments, such as the ideology of progress,
                    popular images of technology, and the emergence of a consumer culture. By neglecting popular
                    attitudes about technology and the representation of systems in mass culture, Hughes misses the
                    monkey wrenches of skepticism, sarcasm, and outrage that ordinary people have often tossed into the
                    works of the systems builders. As a result, Hughes gives the impression that the technological
                    ideologues were right in arguing that systems had replaced human beings—a form of
                    technological determinism at odds with his keen Mumfordian insights into modern history.</p>

                    </placeName> and must be avoided. Even aid to Britain was unacceptable because it would only lead
                    America to war. The <hi rend="i">Daily News</hi> and CDA argued, on the other hand, that Nazi
                    tyranny and ambition were the real dangers and that aid to Britain would, in fact, help avoid <placeName>

                    </placeName> military involvement. With passage of the lend-lease act in March, 1941, the proaid

                    </placeName> policy, but the debate itself continued. The invective and attacks by both sides on the
                    integrity of the other escalated. With repeated and unsubstantiated assertions that the majority of

                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Delano Roosevelt was duping the public into war, the isolationists obscured their best
                    arguments about the risks of intervention. Conversely, the internationalists hurt their cause and
                    muddled the issues by charging that the administration's critics hated Roosevelt more than
                    Hitler and were doing the Nazis' work in America.</p>
            <p>Realist critics of American foreign policy such as Hans Morgenthau, George Kennan, and <placeName>

                    wanted something for nothing. Schneider adds a new and disturbing implication. The public debate
                    gave the president no positive guidance and produced no foreign policy consensus. Some scholars
                    assert that Harry S Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson should have sought congressional declarations of

            <p>Scholars have examined house types from many disciplines and perspectives. But to dismiss <hi rend="i">Common Houses in America's Small Towns</hi> as simply another contribution to
                    an eclectic field would be a mistake. As cultural/historical geographers, the authors pose two basic
                    questions: which common houses predominate in the eastern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and how do they vary geographically? To answer these questions, the authors take a
                    scientific approach, surveying 17,000 old and new single family dwellings ("common
                    houses") in twenty carefully selected small towns (including <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rockville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana) spread across four east-west cultural zones. From this data base, they
                    develop a logical house-type classification system using form rather than ornamentation, test
                    hypotheses about house-type distribution (contradicting many assumptions), and discover spatial and
                    temporal relationships between towns according to their housing characteristics.</p>
            <p>The authors present their findings through concise text and numerous black-and-white photographs,
                    drawings, tables, diagrams, and maps, most of which are essentially graphs indicating each
                    town's percentage of houses in each form category. An introductory chapter reviews the
                    literature on house types and explains the perspectives taken by cultural geographers. The next
                    chapter describes the classification scheme and the criteria for selecting the study towns, which
                    are briefly discussed in the following chapter. An examination of the geographic distribution of
                    basic house characteristics comprises the next chapter. Five subsequent chapters discuss each major
                    house form and its variants. The concluding chapter argues that how Americans house themselves is
                    more easily discovered than how houses vary geographically. A helpful glossary of structural forms,
                    a bibliography, and an index complete the volume.</p>
            <p>Although mechanical flaws, such as the absence in the bibliography of a work cited in the text, are
                    few, readers might wish that traditional pie charts had been substituted for the square charts on
                    the map-graphs. Most disappointing about the book is its incomplete summarization and synthesis,
                    particularly in the concluding chapter, of the abundant detail presented. For example, some nagging
                    questions arise. What combination of house forms characterizes each town and the four cultural
                    regions? Why, not in terms of number of linkages but in specifics of form, structure, and detail,

            <p>Overall, the book's valuable contributions to methodology, classification, and information
                    far outweigh its few shortcomings. As an excellent classification and field guide, Common Houses
                    should be consulted by all who study house types and distribution.</p>

            <p>A remarkable social document was created by photographers working for a federal agency founded during
                    the depths of the Great Depression and active through the gearing up of the industrial war effort.
                    Beginning in 1935 as the Historical Section of the Resettlement Administration, the
                    agency's mission was to inform the public of the plight of the rural poor and to document
                    Resettlement's efforts to improve the circumstances of this "submerged
                    third" of the population. Resettlement and its programs were absorbed by the Farm Security
                    Administration (Department of Agriculture) in 1937, and the photographic staff was transferred to
                    the Office of War Information in 1943 and allowed to wither.</p>
            <p>Throughout their mission, the work of the photographers was guided by their able director, Roy
                    Emerson Stryker, a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> economics instructor, who expanded his initial charge and guided the photographers in a
                    continuing project aimed at fulfilling his dream of a comprehensive visual encyclopedia of American
                    life. The resultant files have been housed at the Library of Congress since 1943 as the FSA/OWI
                    Collection. Although short of a total realization of Stryker's dream, these files are a
                    national treasure. The extent to which this has been recognized can be gauged by leafing through
                    Penelope Dixon's <hi rend="i">Photographers of the Farm Security Administration: An
                        Annotated Bibliography</hi> (1983), which requires fully 250 pages to record all that has been
                    published about, or has made use of, the FSA photographs.</p>
            <p>The FSA/OWI files are also the subject of <hi rend="i">Documenting America,</hi> which is far more
                    than the fiftieth-anniversary tribute it purports to be. The book, edited by Carl Fleischhauer and
                    Beverly W. Brannan, is an indispensable guide for the researcher who uses the files and is a very
                    thorough and accessible introduction for the general reader. It avoids the heavy emphasis, so
                    characteristic of earlier works, on the photographers as artists/personalities. It instead presents
                    the photographs themselves in a new way—perhaps <pb n="245" id="VAA4025-086-2-121"/>
                    closer to Stryker's own intentions—and corrects a number of factual errors
                    which, made early on, have been endlessly repeated.</p>
            <p>The editors have chosen to reproduce single, complete assignments recorded by each of the principal
                    photographers. An example is the fourteen-print selection from a series by Gordon Parks entitled
                    "Ella Watson, U.S. Government Charwoman." Only one photograph from this series has
                    heretofore been widely published (a close-up of Watson and her broom against an American flag
                    background), and while it is an arresting image, alone it gives no hint of the details of a life
                    that can be viewed when the entire series is examined. The point made is that the hit-the-high-spots
                    approach of most earlier works on the FSA photographs results in misconceptions about the nature of
                    the work and of its real value as a source of historical information.</p>
            <p>An assessment of this value is made in the opening essays by Lawrence W. Levine and Alan
                    Trachtenberg. The best, however, is saved for last. At the back of the book is a wonderful essay in
                    which the authors describe not only the FSA/OWI files' content and arrangement, but also
                    their assembly and reorganization by the Library of Congress. Thanks to this essay, future
                    researchers will know much more about what they can expect to encounter when working with the files.
                    The authors reveal, for instance, that their detailed count puts the size of the file at only about
                    half the figure most commonly cited. Even so, there appears to be a vast amount of material not
                    previously dealt with by historians. <hi rend="i">Documenting America</hi> is an important work for
                    anyone interested in documentary photography. It is an essential one for scholars interested in the
                    history captured by the FSA/OWI photographers.</p>
