                        <p>What then shall I speak of? The West? Aye, the West—the growing, prosperous
                  West—the land of broad rivers and rich prairies; and, as some say, of knaves and
                  pickpockets—of visionaries dreaming of eminence and fortune, and bankrupts who have removed
                  thither, to get rid of the impolite calls of their creditors.</p>
                        <p>Between you and me, my friend, I have almost concluded to make this same west the place of my future
                  abode. You know also that it is not a characteristic of mine to be visionary. I have weighed the
                  advantages and disadvantages of a removal in opposite and equally poised scales. I have considered the
                  matter dispassionately, deliberately, seriously, and have come to the conclusion that it will be
                  decidedly for my interest to bid adieu to <placeName>
                              <region>New England</region>
                           </placeName>, and to the mournful ditty of "over the hills and far away," set my
                  face toward the setting sun. The prospects of Lawyers in <placeName>
                              <region>New England</region>
                           </placeName> are by no means cheering enough to satisfy <hi rend="i">me.</hi> The profession, even
                  now, groans with the number of its supernumerary incumbents. The people here are becoming more and
                  more enlightened, and, as I think, less and less fond of litigation. I can make a living in my
                  profession in <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                           </placeName>—I can do the same in <placeName>
                              <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                           </placeName>. But this is not enough. I shall never be satisfied with it, until I am confident that I
                  can do no better. I have no strong desire to be rich, but I am determined not to die <hi rend="i">poor</hi> if it can possibly be avoided. The western states are increasing with almost unparalleled
                  rapidity.</p>
                        <p>The expenses of living there are much less than in <placeName>
                              <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                           </placeName>. The people are more ignorant, and consequently are more inclined to litigation, and are
                  more apt to get entangled in the intricacies of the law. Professional men are more scarce, and are
                  looked upon as persons of some considerable importance.—These are some of the reasons which
                  induce me to think of bidding adieu to the land of my birth. I would not be misunderstood. I do not
                  expect that a young man can there obtain legal or political elevation without the possession of
                  uncommon powers of mind, or vigorous untiring labor. But I do think that his prospects as a Lawyer or
                  a Politician (if he enter into political life) would be better there than in <placeName>
                              <region>New England</region>

                        <p>Have you concluded to remain in Kennebunk? I hope not. It is no place for a man of any degree of
                  energy. You can live there it is <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The young man, who penned the above letter to his friend, Robert Smith, had nothing in common with the
          knaves, pickpockets, visionaries, or bankrupts that were said to be migrating to the West. The self-analysis,
          the study of facts, the calmness in reaching important decisions, the impatience with prejudices, revealed in
          that letter, were prominent characteristics of Hugh McCulloch. Even in this friendly and confidential letter,
          he did not suggest that his physician had advised that he go West for the benefit of his health. In that
          respect, the West proved to be a suitable place of residence, as he said in December, 1837, that he enjoyed
          better health than ever before.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This young man would deserve much from the growing West, because he was fitted by native ability and training
          for leadership. He was descended from a highly respected Scotch family, that settled in Kennebunk Port, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
               </placeName>, about 1765. His father was one of the largest ship owners of <placeName>
                  <region>New England</region>

               </placeName>, was "the best man and the best scholar" of his class.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
          Hugh McCulloch was educated in Kennebunk, at Saco Academy, and at Bowdoin College,<hi rend="sup">5</hi> whence
          he withdrew in less than two years on account of ill health. He had <hi rend="i">good</hi> teachers, among
          them being William Emerson, a man of many admirable qualities, simple manners, and ripe scholarship; and a Mr.
          Pratt at Saco. His health having improved, he taught until 1829. In the meantime he began reading law in
            Kennebunk.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Then he became a student at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>

          continually and consciously learned by giving careful attention to conversations, sermons, debates in

          sermons, letters, speeches and Shakespeare.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> He weighed, organized, and judged all that he
          heard or read with deliberation and independence, and not infrequently expressed his own convictions in

          narrowing for his eager intellect. Through his devotion to education, the arts and sciences, religion, and
          public questions, he became a cultured gentleman, who numbered among his friends men such as the Beechers,

            <p>In order to better appreciate the character and ability of this newcomer to Indiana, it may be appropriate to
          notice briefly his continuing interest in such fields of human thought as education, the arts and sciences,
          religion, and politics. In numerous ways from his boyhood days in Kennebunk throughout a long life he revealed
          his devotion to education. He was always a student, who manifested real interest in the welfare of others. He
          saw the beginning of free schools in <placeName>

          school during its first year, 1853.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Seven years before the coming of free schools,
          McCulloch participated in the meeting at which the Methodist College (now Taylor University at Upland,
          Indiana) was organized.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> In 1858 Lyman C. Draper notified him of his election to a

            <p>How difficult it would have been to be indifferent toward religion in the years during which Hugh McCulloch
          grew to manhood! During his boyhood and youth, "The Westminster Catechism was the standard of
          religious faith" in Congregational <placeName>
                  <region>New England</region>
               </placeName>. When Unitarianism became its rival, almost all of the congregation at Kennebunk, the parents of
          Hugh McCulloch included, went with the Unitarians. Young McCulloch, like others of this era, gave considerable
          thought to questions of theology, without yielding to narrow sectarianism. He heard Methodist circuit riders,
          orthodox preachers and Unitarian pastors. He listened to the powerful, non-denominational, sailor-preacher of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
               </placeName>, Father Taylor. The great Unitarian pulpit leaders were his favorites—Channing,

            <p>His interest in religion was sincere and deep—an interest that he never neglected in a long and
          busy life—yet he could never be a sectarian. After noting changes in both orthodoxy and
          Unitarianism, he said: "There has been evolution in religion and there will continue to be as long as
          mankind advance in culture and humanity."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> To McCulloch, her future brother-

            <p>In both Europe and America, events of great magnitude were shaping the future during Hugh
          McCulloch's youth and early manhood. He was attracted to the study of many public questions and
          theories, including liberalism, natural rights, and abolition.</p>
            <p>In the middle of the nineteenth century, McCulloch was much interested in the cause of liberalism in Europe.
          He wished that his government would protest "against the violations of the great international
          code," but he considered it absurd to think that the <placeName>

               </placeName> must back her opinion with the bayonet should her protest be disregarded. He had great faith in

            </byline>
            <p>In 1839, the whole program of internal improvements in Indiana collapsed. Work was stopped in that year on
          all of the state projects with the exception of the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wabash</region>
               </placeName> and Erie Canal. Much of the blame for this breakdown must be laid, not on the undertaking, but on
          the business methods followed. The works contemplated were rather extensive considering the sparse population
          of the state at the time, nevertheless the internal improvement program would have had a fair chance of
          success if it had been properly managed, in spite of the great depression that followed the panic of 1837.
          However, the business methods followed by the state were anything but good.</p>
            <p>Since the sales of public lands granted to Indiana by Congress were disappointing about five-sixth of the
          funds necessary for the proposed work on roads, canals, and railroads had to be raised by bond issues. The
          "System" orators had promised no higher taxation, and consequently the Assembly had made no
          provision for payment of the interest on the bonds. It was necessary therefore to pay interest charges out of
          the receipts from the sale of bonds.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The entire business of the Commissioners who handled
          the funds was poorly conducted. No records were kept. Their reports were incomplete or inconsistent and it
          seems that the bonds were signed and delivered to the members of the board to sell as best they could. The
          annual report of the Canal Fund Commissioners in 1837 is revealing. It contains the statement: "The
          Board in the contracts which were made during the present year on the sale of the state bonds, made no
          stipulations as to the kind of funds to be received…."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Agents selling the bonds seem to have taken advantage of provisions such as this. Many of the bonds were sold
          on credit or exchanged for other securities in the face of a law to the contrary. In several instances, the
          purchaser lost through speculations and could not pay. In some cases, the agent of the state was at the same
          time a member of the firm <list type="footnotes">

          proceeds. The cost to the state in negotiating the sale amounted to a fourth of the face value of the bonds.
          From a total bond issue of almost $15,000,000, the State realized $8,593,000 in cash,
          $4,000,000 in worthless securities, while about $2,000,000 was embezzled or
          misappropriated by its officers and agents.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Much of this loss resulting from the sale of
          the bonds might have been avoided if the authorities had not been in such a hurry to complete the works

          letting contracts.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>The state government paid little attention to all these irregularities until the money began to fail after
          1839. A resolution offered in the Senate at that time referred to "notorious" current rumors
          of fraud, gross negligence, mismanagement, and wasteful, and unlawful expenditures by the Board of Internal
          Improvements. In his message of December, 1841, the Governor asserted: "Every fair and impartial mind
          must receive the impression, that Indiana has been in many cases the victim of preconcerted imposition and
            fraud."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>By 1839, the state could find no more purchasers for its bonds, and, consequently, the entire system
          collapsed. Fortunately, the credit of the state failed before all the indebtedness contemplated under the
          Mammoth Bill of 1836 had been incurred. As it was, the state was bankrupt. Its income was not sufficient to
          cover interest payments. Additional money could not be raised through taxation because of the stagnation in
          business and fall in the appraisal value of all property since the panic of 1837.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>The Indiana General Assembly of 1839 seemed bewildered by the state of affairs. The stealing of public funds

          for the return of the canal after the debt had been paid. In both the Act of 1846 and the Act of 1847, the
          State expressly reserved the right to resume the ownership of the work when that part of the debt authorized
          to be taken out of the canal revenues had been paid.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> As late as 1853, a competent

            </p>
            <p>However, these expectations failed to materialize. The railroads came in the next few years and took away

                  <region type="county">Wabash</region>
               </placeName> and Erie Canal. With the dwindling away of the receipts of the canal, the creditors who had
          agreed to accept the canal revenues in payment for half of their bonds, saw their security steadily shrinking.
          The bondholders became alarmed and sent petitions to the Legislature urging that their rights be safeguarded.
          In 1857, a committee presented a memorial asking for payment in full because the state had allowed railways to
          be constructed that would compete with the canal. As a result, the security of the bondholders had been made
          practically valueless. The bondholders did not doubt the state's policy in granting railroad
          charters. They admitted that it was correct to take advantage of improved means of transportation, but they
          asked redress for the impairment of their security which they contended had been guaranteed from harm or
          molestation. The bondholders also argued that the state could not ignore interests which it had already
          created, and that it was therefore morally bound to make reparation.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

            <p>Indiana had attempted to forestall railroad competition. After the passage of the Debt Act of 1847, the

            <p>In 1870, a case arose that involved the old issue between the state and the bondholders concerned in the
          settlement of 1847. John W. Garrett brought suit to secure payment on forty-one of the canal bonds which had
          not been turned in under the terms of the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
               </placeName> Bill of 1847. The Governor consulted his legal advisors to determine the best method of dealing
          with this unwelcome situation. He was told that Garrett had the legal right to payment in spite of provisions
          to the contrary in the act of 1847. To refuse payment because he had failed to turn in his bonds under the
          conditions of the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
               </placeName> Bill would amount to repudiation and would violate the section of the <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>
               </placeName> Constitution forbidding a state to pass a law impairing the obligation of contract.</p>
            <p>While the government of Indiana could not have been held for the payment of the bonds, because a state cannot
          be sued, nevertheless Garrett could have collected from the trustees of the canal. If the state had permitted
          the trustees who represented the bondholders to pay these bonds, such action would have amounted to
          confiscation of property of bondholders who had accepted the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
               </placeName> Bill, and in that case the state would have become morally bound to rescind the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
               </placeName> Bill and" to pay all the bondholders. Pressure of public opinion would probably have
          forced such action.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> In order to avoid such a possibility the matter was brought before

            <p>Meanwhile, those bondholders who had accepted the compromise of 1847 were still petitioning for a complete
          settlement of the securities held by them. Considerable bitterness was evidenced in Indiana over this attempt
          of the bondholders to abrogate the terms of the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>

            <p>In studying the growth of any community, no matter what its importance in the scheme of things, the fact that
          it has drawn its strength from a variety of human elements, that its material prosperity rests on a foundation
          composed of diversified economic activities, and that it has attained its place among its sister groups in a
          short time, cannot but be of interest. When to these features, one adds that the region which is to furnish
          the subject of this study is of first rank in the affairs of the state of Indiana, further <hi rend="i">apologia</hi> are unnecessary. <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Lake County</region>
               </placeName> fits into the above picture very neatly. Her population almost surpasses the term heterogeneous;
          the farm, the factory, the railroad, and the steamship, each has its place of importance in her economic
          scheme; and the metamorphosis from dreary swamps to busy cities, while of almost superhuman dimensions has
          occupied only the normal span of a man's life.</p>
            <p>Such miracles, however, are not inexplicable. In the case presented here, we must look first of all at the
          geographic factors. <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Lake County</region>
               </placeName> lies at the extreme northwestern corner of the state, bounded on the north by <geogName>Lake
            Michigan</geogName>, on the south by the Kankakee River, on the east by <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Porter County</region>
               </placeName>, and on the west by <placeName>

               </placeName>. The center of the county lies not over thirty miles from the heart of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
               </placeName>, the transportation center of the interior of the nation. The situation of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
               </placeName> makes it necessary for all railroad lines coming from the East and South to pass through
          northwestern Indiana, with the result that this region is covered with an intricate mass of parallel,
          converging, and intersecting lines. Besides, the entire Great Lakes region can be, and has been, made to bring
          its raw materials and products to the docks of southern <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName>. <placeName>

          basis for a canal system and a group of internal waterways, the Calumet Rivers are ideal. These once formed a
          single river that followed a hairpin course. The source was in <placeName>

               </placeName>. A new channel to <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> was opened by Indians through the marshes
          between Wolf Lake and Calumet Lake. This produced two rivers. The southern one, which flows westward across <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Lake County</region>

                  <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
               </placeName>, is the Little Calumet. The northern one which flows eastward and which for many years discharged
          into the Lake a little west of the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Porter County</region>

               </placeName> is former <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> bottom, the general contour of the district and the
          quality of the soil vary considerably. There was a good deal of low swamp land around the "south
            bay"<hi rend="sup">3</hi> of the lake, but it has practically all been drained and reclaimed.
          Proceeding to the central and southern townships, one finds that the land is no longer a part of the area once
          covered by the lake, and it is not so level as that of the northern areas. Here, there is a noticeable change
          in the quality of the soil as well, for the white and yellow sands of the lake shore give way to a white clay,
          and finally to a deep, rich, black soil. These rolling prairie lands rival those of the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName> prairies farther west. A writer of the middle period made this comment: "There is the

          by the flooding of the Kankakee, while the Calumet marshes now furnish the sites of residences and stores in
          prosperous towns. About midway between the northern and southern boundaries of the county, runs the almost

            <p>The early history of this area is not very well known. It is thought that in 1672 Father Claude Allouez and
          Father D'Ablon, French Missionaries, visited the Indians in the Calumet Region, and that a little
          later Father Marquette went down the Calumet River to its mouth, the present site of Gary Beach.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> La Salle is supposed to have used the route around the lake shore in his journeys between <placeName>

          as well as in the conspiracy of Pontiac. In the latter disturbance, they participated in the attack on <placeName>

               </placeName>. Prominent among the fur traders were Joseph Bailly, who kept the post now known as Baileytown
          (or Baillytown), an Englishman named William Burnet, and two negroes, DeSaible and Mai. <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Dearborn</settlement>

          Indians who were going from the East to the lands of the Mini and the Sioux. The famous Sauk (or Sac) Trail
          cut across the present "LaPorte, Porter and Lake Counties to Joliet, on the western border of the

            <p>In 1828 the national government bought from the Potawatomis a strip of land ten miles wide across the
          northern border of Indiana and touching the Southern tip of the lake. By another treaty, made in 1932, all the
          Indian lands in Indiana were purchased, and while the former owners continued to hunt and fish in the
          game-filled marshes of the Calumet and the Kankakee, their regime in northern Indiana was over. Of course,
          some of the Indians laid "floats"<hi rend="sup">8</hi> on lands purchased from them, but

            <p>In the summer of 1834, a group of surveyors under a certain St. Clair came into the present boundaries of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Lake County</region>
               </placeName> and laid off the land, which was then still included in LaPorte County, into sections. They
          camped at the present site of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Crown Point</settlement>
               </placeName>. During the period occupied by this work, a man named William Butler appeared and laid out four
          claims, two for himself and brother, and two for his friends, George and Theodore Wells. After putting up some
          log cabins, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
               </placeName> left. During the same autumn, Charles Wilson, Richard Fancher and two others came to Cedar Lake
          from Attica, Indiana. Fancher staked off a claim in Section 17, near the Lake which now bears his name. Wilson
          and the other two men took up land near Cedar Lake. Seeing no chance to spend the winter with any degree of
          comfort in this uninhabited region, the men returned to the <placeName>

            <p>In the next two years colonization began in earnest. A settlement was made in the south central portion of
          the county near the later town of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lowell</settlement>
               </placeName>. New settlers came in from <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Jennings County</region>
               </placeName> and the Robinson camp became the nucleus of a small hamlet. Fancher now returned to his claim and
          the Browns and Hornors came back to Cedar Lake. Milo Robinson of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName> came to his brother's settlement and soon opened a store. Pioneers began to come in from <placeName>
                  <region>New England</region>
               </placeName>. Prospects were very favorable for the development of a thriving farm community in this region.</p>
            <p>By the winter of 1835–1836, the Indiana Legislature saw fit to divide the large territory of
          Laporte County into smaller units. The <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Lake County</region>
               </placeName> area was now made a part of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Porter County</region>
               </placeName>, a new political division cut out of the old LaPorte County. This status remained only until
          February, 1837, when <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Lake County</region>
               </placeName> was formed from Porter. Somewhat later in the year, <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Lake County</region>
               </placeName> was divided into three townships, North, Center, and South, the first two of which still exist,
          although greatly modified in size and boundaries. Elections were held, and a justice of the peace chosen for
          each township.</p>
            <p>One problem, however, of great consequence which had been foreseen remained to be solved. Suppose the titles
          of these first settlers to the land, based as they were solely on squatters' rights, should not be
          secured? Then all the labor and hardship of creating homesteads in the area would not benefit these pioneers.
          Surely some means of cooperating to keep their holdings intact should be devised. As early as July 4, 1836, a
          meeting was called at the home of Solon Robinson, and the "Squatters' Union of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Lake County</region>
               </placeName>" came into being. A constitution was drawn up, providing: (1) that if Congress should
          not pass a law securing the rights of the <list type="footnotes">

               <pb n="122" id="VAA4025-032-2-030"/> squatters before the lands were placed on public sale, then the Union
          would secure the rights of its members by "such measures as may be necessary"<hi rend="sup">14</hi> (2) that three men be constituted a County Board of Arbitrators and that a man be appointed
          Register of Claims, in order to settle disputes between settlers regarding their claims; (3) that each
          congressional township, or any settlement of twenty members, could elect a Board of Arbitrators to carry on,
          locally, the same functions performed by the County Board; (4) that any white person holding land with the
          purpose of becoming a settler should be allowed to have only one-fourth of a section, except that one-fourth
          of that amount <hi rend="sup">15</hi> of timber land might be added to give the settler a sufficient supply
          for his needs; and (5) that persons who obtained land only for the sake of speculation should have their lands
          taken away and sold, the proceeds reverting to the treasury of the Squatters' Union. Evidently these
          pioneers meant to have and to hold the fertile lands which they had occupied. It was with this same
          determination that they went to the Public Lands Office in Laporte in 1839 to attend the auction sales of the
          lands, but in bidding for their lands they met with no opposition, and were able each to buy his claim. The
          speculators were to have their inning, however, as we shall see later.</p>

            <p>There ensued, within the next few years, a very interesting struggle over the location of the county seat,
          which was prophetic of the internal strife which was to characterize the county in later years. After the
          organization of the County, sessions of the new court were held at Robinson's court house for a year
          before the locating commissioners took any action.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> The Legislature established the
          temporary court house at Milo Robinson's residence.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> It was impossible at this
          time to locate the court house permanently, since the land in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Lake County</region>
               </placeName> was still practically all owned by the federal government, and continued to be until the land
          sales at Laporte in March, 1839. The Legislature also appointed two new members to the locating commission.
          Again the commission failed to function, and again the Legislature was compelled to act. Thus, in February,
          1839 an entirely new commission was set up with the power to determine the location of the county seat. In May
          the commission met at Robinson's court house. A glance at the claimants to the honor to be awarded
          will perhaps be interesting.</p>

          country, now caused considerable concern here. The panic of 1837, although its worst effects on Indiana were
          delayed, finally struck the state in force in 1839 and 1840, when the <placeName>

          purchase the lands on which they had located had not been opposed at the land sales of 1839, now found
          themselves riding the horns of a new dilemma. In accordance with Jackson's specie circular of 1836,
          the land office had refused to accept from the settlers the bank notes of all non-specie paying banks which
          were all they had to offer. With their specie practically all gone, chiefly because of the necessity of
          improving their lands, these men now had to resort to the speculators, whom they heartily despised and even
          hated. The latter, losing no time in taking advantage of the situation, offered to lend them the money needed
          for entering their claims at the land office, and in return secured mortgages on the land at interest rates of

          1839. In 1843 a wave of scarlet fever invaded this region,<hi rend="sup">36</hi> and again in 1846 a withering

            <p>Crop failures sank the settlers even deeper into the slough of despond. The blight of 1840 mentioned above,
          the rust which attacked the wheat again in 1844, and the heat, drought, and potato rot of 1845—all
          these, coupled with the low price of wheat and the fact that produce had to be hauled forty miles to <placeName>

               </placeName>. It failed, however, to acquire even the transitory success achieved by Liverpool, and never
          became more than a name and a paper plat. When it was finally sold for $14,000 in 1841, no
          settlement had yet been made on the town site. West Point, a contender for the county seat honor at the
          beginning of the County's history, had not been able to hold its population with the wealth of
          prairie land beckoning from the southern part of the County, and faded out in the middle forties.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> These failures, however, were of considerable importance, for they cleared the way for
          future growth on a sound foundation of real prosperity and industry.</p>
            <p>Four new political-divisions had by this time been carved out of the old Center and North townships. In the
          east central part of the county, Winfield Township was created in 1843, but its boundaries have been altered
          several times since that date.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Ross and St. Johns townships were taken from the northern
          part of Center in 1848.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> The founding of the village of Hobart in 1849 led to the
          division of North Township and the formation from it of Hobart Township.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> There were now
          nine townships in the County.</p>
            <p>Towns were still, with the exception of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Crown Point</settlement>
               </placeName>, non-existent. John Wood had come to the <geogName>Deep River</geogName> valley from Danvers, <placeName>

               </placeName> as early at 1935, but his settlement, first known as <geogName>Deep River</geogName>, and later
          as Woodvale, did not attract many new settlers. The village was located on an old Indian reservation in Ross
          Township at the <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Porter County</region>
               </placeName> line, which was a good site for the saw and first grist mills that Wood erected there. Because of
          his desire to keep liquor out of his community, Wood never laid out a town, and, perhaps for the same reason,
          the settlement experienced little growth.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> At any rate, saloons did not appear at
            <geogName>Deep River</geogName>. In Cedar Creek Township, settlement had been begun in 1842 at

               </placeName>, is completing a small volume upon John and William Conner, pioneers of central and eastern
          Indiana. Both of the brothers were prominent in Indian affairs, in trade, in the early settlement of the
          territory and state, and in its subsequent development.</p>
            <p>The house which William Conner built on <geogName>White River</geogName>, below Noblesvile, was one of the
          important centers of the New Purchase for many years. It has recently been restored and developed privately as

          Mrs. Charles N. Thompson, read at the Indiana History Conference in December, 1925, was the first fruit of the
          work which Mr. and Mrs. Thompson were doing <pb n="132" id="VAA4025-032-2-040"/> at that time and which Mr.
          Thompson has developed more fully since then.</p>

            <p>Learning Geography from "Date Lines" can be made an interesting and valuable exercise. Ask
          a history class what <placeName>
                  <country reg="gu">Guam</country>
               </placeName> and Midway are, and they will tell you that they are airplane bases for the new Clipper Ship
          air-mail route to the Orient. Ask what the members know about Tokio, and they will tell you that the Japanese
          "World Series" was held there this past fall. Question students about the South Seas, and
          they will tell you that a scientific expedition was sent there as revealed in the movie, "Mutiny on
          the Bounty."</p>
            <p>Many history teachers will feel humiliated, but refrain from critical remarks if their students answer in
          this manner; others will openly reprimand their students for their ignorance. But to the alert and sympathetic
          teacher, these answers provide an opening wedge for the linking of current events and geography. The pupils
          questioned have some knowledge of these places in so far as current events are concerned, even if they cannot
          point them out on a world map or globe.</p>
            <p>Therefore, why not mount a large map of the world on the bulletin board, leaving space enough for a large
          number of newspaper clippings around the map. Ask each pupil to bring in a newspaper article with the
          "date line" from some place outside of the <placeName>
                  <country reg="-us">United States</country>
               </placeName>. Ask them to locate the cities or sections from which their news items have been cabled, and, if
          time permits, state something about each of those places. After the news story is thoroughly discussed from
          the standpoint of current events, it should be mounted on the bulletin board in the vacant space surrounding
          the map and linked with the proper spot on the map by a piece of string or some other device. <placeName>
                  <country reg="gu">Guam</country>

          confined to one period during the semester. It should carry on throughout the semester or year as either a
          weekly or daily plan so that the full effect of its usefulness may be obtained.</p>
            <p>Electing a Hall of Fame is another possible exercise of value. Students entering high school are also
          entering on the age of hero worship. Many of them will choose movie stars and professional athletes as their
          heroes. One can expect that. But a few of them will choose nobler and abler individuals, if the history
          teacher is aware of his opportunity and avails himself of the chance to recreate the immortals of history and
          make them vivid and real to boys and girls.</p>
            <p>One of the best aids in this work is the enormous number of books of biography, both collective works and
          individual biographies, arranged for different ages. An example of this is the story of Edward Bok, called <hi rend="i">A Dutch Boy Fifty Years After</hi>, which is the Junior High School edition, and <hi rend="i">The
            Americanization of Edward Bok</hi>, which is the regular, unabridged edition of the same story.</p>
            <p>Teachers often seem to be unaware of this vast material. For such instructors no more valuable aids could be
          suggested than the <hi rend="i">Leisure Reading</hi> and <hi rend="i">Home Reading</hi> pamphlets of the
          National Council of Teachers of English. The former is an exhaustive, annotated list of books in many fields
          for boys and girls in the seventh, eighth and ninth grades, while the latter is a similar book-list for pupils
          in grades nine to twelve. Both contain sections on biography which are invaluable.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Teachers of older students should be acquainted with series of <hi rend="i">Biographical Sketches</hi>

               </placeName> University's Hall of Fame. In Statuary Hall, two busts have been placed by each state. <placeName>

               </placeName> University's Hall of Fame has sixty-nine busts chosen by a group of one hundred one
          distinguished citizens from various occupations and residing in different states. These have been chosen at
          the rate of five every five years. In the selection of 1935 only three candidates were chosen, William Penn,
          Simon Newcomb, and Grover <placeName>

            <p>The beginnings of history are not easy to explain to young students. Most world history courses are arranged
          to coincide with the growing curiosity of boys and girls for knowledge of how different things began. Thus,
          they are given a picture of primitive man drawing pictures of primitive animals on the walls of his
          cave-dwellings; they are told about the earliest methods for telling time used among the Indians in Central
          America; they are shown pictures of the earliest writing in the form of hieroglyphics and cuneiform; and they
          are acquainted with the beginning of numbers used by the Arabians or Hindus, according to who the author may
          be. Unless the teacher or some brilliant student pieces together the widely scattered blocks on these various
          subjects, as the history of humanity is traced to the present time, no continuity in the development of
          writing, numbers or time is acquired.</p>
            <p>This problem has been solved for us, however, by the Committee on Materials of Instruction of the American
          Council of Education. This Committee pieces together these blocks in gay, variagated patchwork quilts. One of
          them is a brochure on <hi rend="i">Telling Time Through the Centuries</hi>; another, <hi rend="i">The Story of

                  <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
               </placeName>, has long awaited an historian. Established in pursuance of orders issued by General Harmar in
          the summer of 1787, it was built, and for several years commanded, by the valiant Canadian-American officer,
          Major John F. Hamtramck. Although for many years thereafter, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Knox</settlement>
               </placeName> was an important station in the scheme of American frontier defence, one finds comparatively
          little information about it in the usual printed works of reference, and of that little, a considerable
          portion is unreliable. The index to the first twenty-five volumes of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
            History</hi> contains but two references to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Knox</settlement>
               </placeName> (both pertaining to the "true site" of the fort, which until a very recent
          period has been a matter of dispute), while Jacob P. Dunn's two-volume, 1200-page history of Indiana
          does not mention it at all. Logan Esarey (<hi rend="i">History of Indiana … to 1850</hi>) does
          somewhat better, supplying a brief account of the establishment of the Fort, and several references to
          councils held at the place. All in all, however, one may pardonably wonder why Indiana historians have dealt
          so briefly (if at all) with one of the earliest, and for many years one of the most important stations of the <placeName>

               </placeName> Army within the borders of the state.</p>
            <p>The formal record of military activities which a garrison orderly book comprises presents at best but a
          partial and fragmentary picture of the life of the period to which it belongs. Yet the fragments presented are
          frequently helpful in rounding out the fuller structure of source material which the historian who undertakes
          to recreate the life of a bygone period must have at his command. Unknown to Indiana scholars, such a record
          of military activities at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Knox</settlement>
               </placeName> for the four-year period from the spring of 1793 to the spring of 1797 has for decades been
          preserved at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
               </placeName>, more recently in the Burton Historical Collection. The volume begins with the record of garrison

                  <settlement type="city">Fort Hamilton</settlement>
               </placeName>, from April 24 to May 1, 1793, under command of Captain Thomas Pasteur. At this time, apparently,
          Pasteur was ordered to relieve Lieutenant <pb n="138" id="VAA4025-032-2-046"/> -Colonel Hamtramck at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Knox</settlement>

          Anthony <placeName>

                  <settlement type="city">Fort Knox</settlement>
               </placeName>, carrying the <placeName>

               </placeName> orderly book with him, and on June 24, 1793, formally assumed command of his new station. Here he
          remained at least until May 16, 1797, when he signed the final entry in the present orderly book. John B.
          Dillon states (<hi rend="i">Hist. of Indiana…</hi>, 397) that Pasteur was transferred from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fort Knox</settlement>
               </placeName> to Fort Massac in September, 1798. The comprehensive sketch of his career in <hi rend="i">Indiana
            Historical Collections</hi>, XV, 87, is obviously incorrect in-so-far as it concerns Pasteur's
          share in General <placeName>

            <p>These "selected writings" from the pen of Solon Robinson constitute Volume XXI of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Historical Collections</hi>, and will be followed by the publication of a second volume
          containing another installment in the same series. A foreword by Christopher B. Coleman, Director of the
          Indiana Historical Bureau, presents an admirable introduction. There is a calendar of all the known writings
          of Robinson and those reproduced here are starred. The sketch of the pioneer writer's life is
          sufficient to introduce the main part of the book. Documents from the period, 1827–1845, most of
          which were published in agricultural periodicals and which treat a wide variety of subjects, fill over five
          hundred pages. These were penned before Robinson took up writing as a profession, but they reveal, even in
          this early period, interests that were remarkable. He was highly pleased at seeing his writings in print and
          as postmaster of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Lake County</region>
               </placeName> Court House with the privilege of franking his correspondence, he was generous in his offerings.
          All subjects of current interest were either blessed or damned by him, and editors soon came to welcome
          whatever he had to offer.</p>
            <p>Solon Robinson was truly a "man of parts" with a humanitarian spirit. He was born in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
               </placeName> where he experienced the hardships of the <placeName>
                  <region>New England</region>
               </placeName> farm. He went to <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName> and later settled in Indiana where he began a career as an agricultural leader. After removing to <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName>, he became an agricultural editor; he finished his career in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
               </placeName> but always his greatest interest was the development of the West. Like most Westerners of the
          early period he favored rapid settlement of the country but this "King of Squatters" was a
          person who unselfishly wished others to share his opportunity and experience. Seeing the wasteful methods of
          the West, Robinson discouraged people who would not be capable of withstanding hardship and who with Utopian
          dreams of many acres and quick wealth planned to leave comfortable <placeName>
                  <region>New England</region>
               </placeName> homes. He traveled widely; he labored for agricultural <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-032-2-079"/>
          reform; he encouraged temperance and women's rights; and he believed the country was doomed unless
          the Whigs were kept in control.</p>
            <p>The most valuable work to which Robinson gave his interest was agriculture. He wrote for many agricultural
          periodicals, encouraged discussion of the problems faced by farmers both in the East and West, and
          persistently advised his contemporaries to subscribe for a farm journal. His "country store"
          philosophy appealed to readers of that time and although the methods that he advocated would not be followed
          in every instance today, he was a pioneer in agricultural science. The descriptions of the country seen in his
          travels and the discussion of the towns through which he passed are presented with an objectivity that at
          times led to bitterness. Courage was needed; he showed the faults and advised means to overcome them; he
          wanted his people to be ambitious and progressive. He was almost prophetic in his writings and one may marvel
          at his modern ideas for improvement. Such men should have a high place in history.</p>
            <p>Solon Robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of the formation of a national society of agriculture
          which was in turn to foster a national agricultural school and journal. The leaders of this movement, like
          many others, hoped to win the Smithson fund, but failing in this their society was doomed. Agitation, however,
          later materialized in the formation of a Department of Agriculture which led to a mutual friendship among such
          agricultural leaders as A. B. Allen, Thomas Affleck, Henry L. Ellsworth, Edmund Ruffin and others.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kellar's compilation of the writings left by Solon Robinson is a valuable addition to the
          history of agriculture and the westward movement. He has been untiring in his effort to identify
          contemporaries mentioned in Robinson's writings, and his footnotes are commendable for accuracy and
          consistency. This volume manifests the editor's sincere interest in the neglected story of
          agriculture and agrarian life. The writings are in suitable form to give the more casual reader of American
          history an idea of the problems and purposes of the early leaders in agrarian organization and agitation. The
          serious student will do well to read all the writings included <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-032-2-080"/> for here
          is an atmosphere and picture that is often missed in secondary writings.</p>

                  <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
               </placeName>, 1936. Pp. x, 105, illustrated.</head>
            <p>Any person is worthy of a biography whose activities in deed and fact have transcended his own community. As
          Judge Williams indicates, minor biographies, or rather biographies of persons considered secondary, when their
          careers are sketched in proper perspective, add very materially to our common storehouse of knowledge. This
          short biography of General Wilder is timely and aids not only in defining his career more clearly, but in
          forming a truer conception of men with whom he was associated, commonly considered greater, as well as making
          the locale of their operation more concrete.</p>
            <p>The biography is disappointing in that every phase of a long life is treated so very briefly except that of
          his military career. John Thomas Wilder was born of English ancestry in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
               </placeName>, and, after receiving only an elementary education, he at the age of nineteen came West and was
          engaged in working in a foundry in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>. Here he remained some eight years and was so successful
          he was offered a partnership in the business. This he declined and removed to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
               </placeName>, Indiana, where he became the owner of a small foundry which he operated until the outbreak of
          the Civil War in 1861. Only a few lines more than two pages are used in the sketch to tell the story of his
          career thus far. Wilder was then thirty-one years old.</p>
            <p>The author sketches well the three years of Wilder's military career. Naturally this being the
          exciting, glamourous, and perhaps the most fascinating period of his career, there is more material to write
          about. But after more than three years of strife, Wilder only thirty-five, had yet more than fifty years to
          live, during which time he engaged in a daring and brilliant business career.</p>
            <p>More than half a century was devoted to invention and industry involving iron manufacturing and coal mining
          in East <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
               </placeName>, in a region he had earlier fought over as enemy's country. To this remarkable business
          venture, when Wilder <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-032-2-081"/> really became a successful promoter in the New
          South, only about nine printed pages are given in the biography. It is regrettable that the author, who knew
          General Wilder personally, did not enlarge more on the later and more important part of a long and useful
          life.</p>
            <p>It has been stated that Wilder's military career in the Civil War is well sketched. The author in
          his preface says that no history of his brigade has yet been written, but makes the challenging assertion that
          "no single brigade of that war earned such renown as did Wilder's Lightning
          Brigade." Wilder enlisted at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
               </placeName> with the Seventeenth Indiana Infantry as a Captain, but soon became a Lieutenant-Colonel. He
          first saw active service with his regiment at Cheat Mountain in what was then western <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>. Late in the fall of 1861, the Seventeenth Indiana Infantry was sent to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
               </placeName> where it was incorporated in Buell's Army of the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>. Early in 1862, Wilder became the Colonel of his regiment, saw service in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>, <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, and by September of that year, he was stationed on the south side of Green River at Munfordville
          with about 3500 men to guard a railroad bridge. There he was surrounded by nearly all of General
          Bragg's army. After a gallant defense during which he was repeatedly asked to surrender, he did a
          very unique thing in military history. He asked advice from the Confederate General Simon B. Buckner as to
          what he ought to do in his predicament. Buckner's and Wilder's stories about the incident
          differ in details but are mainly in agreement on the final results. The fort was surrendered to Bragg and the
          latter designated Buckner to receive Wilder's sword. Ever afterward Wilder blamed Buell, who was then
          on his march to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
               </placeName> to intercept Bragg, for not rescuing him at Munfordville.</p>
            <p>Wilder's brigade did heroic work at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
               </placeName> and also at Chickamauga. It became equipped with <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
               </placeName> rifles, and was mounted part of the time as a cavalry force. Soon after the battle of Chickamauga
          Wilder was made a Brigadier-General. In the fall of 1864, ill health forced his resignation from the Army
          after a very honorable service. In 1866 he left Indiana and lived, until his death in 1917, in East Tennesse,
          most of the time at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Johnson City</settlement>
               </placeName>. The General was a man of fine appearance and the author depicts well his sterling character.
          While holding several positions of honor <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-032-2-082"/> and trust, mostly appointive, he
          was essentially a business man and too frank to be a politician.</p>
            <p>Judge Williams uses a free, easy style in his narrative, interest never flags, and anyone who reads the
          biography will express regret at its brevity. The citations include a long list of good secondary authorities,
          and the footnotes are invaluable. The appendices of nearly fifty pages include a collection of very
          interesting and important source data. A table of contents and index are ommitted, but, due to the size of the
          book, this omission may be pardoned. Mechanically, the monograph is splendidly printed in large, clear type
          and it is attractively bound. The little volume will be read with profit by anyone caring to know about a
          virile, active, much-loved man, whose memory should be perpetuated.</p>

            <p>The sub-title, "Pioneers from <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName> to Indiana 1818," arouses the reader's interest in this handsomely printed and
          handsomely bound volume. In the pages of these nine chapters are interesting descriptions of the development
          of Indiana and of the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Capital City</settlement>
               </placeName>, while many phases of pioneer life are also pictured.</p>
            <p>Though Daniel Yandes is made the central figure of the book, most of the volume deals with his children. From
          his ancestors the pioneer Daniel inherited health, enterprise, thrift, a spirit of adventure, a belief in God
          and a faith in his fellowmen. These characteristics, coupled with a keen enjoyment in living, made him very
          valuable to his adopted state.</p>
            <p>The Yandes family came to the site selected for <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
               </placeName> in 1821. It is interesting to watch the development of the several homes of the Yandes family
          from cabin to palatial residence. The locations of these several homes are of interest. The fifth was on the
          site of the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
               </placeName> Federal Building and the last on the site of the present Indiana University Extension Center.</p>
            <p>The Second Presbyterian Church of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
               </placeName>, which Daniel Yandes helped to found in 1838 and in which the members <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-032-2-083"/> of his family continued to show such a deep interest, was on the site of the
          present English Hotel. Because this part of the city was becoming the business center, the church was moved to
          the northwest corner of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
               </placeName> streets in 1870.</p>
            <p>Daniel Yandes was much interested in building, governing, financing and developing his city, county, and
          state. His descendants have rightly held that he "lived his life fearlessly, uprightly,
          energetically, with good fellowship for his brother man, retaining, even in old age, keen interest in the
          world's progress, and venturing to keep in step."</p>
            <p>Six chapters (II-VII) relate to the children of Daniel Yandes—Simon Yandes, James Wilson Yandes,
          Mary Yandes Wheeler, Catherine Yandes Fletcher, Elizabeth Yandes Robinson, and George Bush Yandes. These
          chapters are well written and fascinating. There is an eighth chapter on the "Yandes
          Memorial" and a final chapter devoted to "Grandfather's Clock," a prized
          possession of George Bush Yandes.</p>
            <p>The eldest son of Daniel and Anna Yandes, Simon Yandes, became an influential and wealthy citizen of Indiana.
          In this volume he is classified as a rare man whose activities were a very important "factor in the
          development of the religious, educational, and business life of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
               </placeName> and the State." In middle life and during his later years, this outstanding member of
          the Yandes family, who was never married, gave away large sums of money to <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Wabash</region>
               </placeName> College, to missionary societies, and to relatives. In all, his gifts amounted to about a million
          dollars. At his death, his estate was valued at $30,000. The lives of the brothers and sisters of
          Simon Yandes are sketched in an impartial manner, but space does not permit a notice of each one.</p>
            <p>The authors of the book are daughters of Elizabeth Yandes Robinson and granddaughters of Daniel and Anna
          Yandes. One of the sisters was born in her grandfather's home, and all three of them were permitted
          to spend many years in companionship with their mother who died in 1904. The last survivor of the immediate
          family of Daniel Yandes was George Bush Yandes, who lived until 1913. Like his brother Simon, George did not
          marry. The writers of the volume knew him intimately, and mention him as the member of the family of Daniel
          Yandes, "in the remembrance of <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-032-2-084"/> whom this book has been
          compiled." The third of the brothers, James Wilson Yandes, married Fanny Bliss Button, but the only
          son born to this union died at birth. There are descendants of Daniel Yandes, but not one who bears his name.</p>
            <p>The volume under review is not a narrative history of the Yandes family, but presents, along with character
          sketches a large amount of source matter, including birth and death records, copies of business papers,
          excerpts from newspapers and addresses of various kinds. It is a useful as well as an interesting book, and
          many readers of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> should find it both helpful and enjoyable.</p>

            <p>The farm of one hundred forty acres on which I was born,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> with the exception of twenty
          acres, remained in my father's possession until 1896. When I was five years old, there were about
          sixty-five acres, less than half, under cultivation. The cleared fields were enclosed with rail fences. For a
          few years there were several fields of about ten acres each and one of fifteen which was increased to twenty.
          In two or three fields there were a few large stumps left, but in the others there were many, both little and
          big. Twenty acres, lying north of the western half of the eighty which constituted the main portion of the
          farm, we always called the "woods-pasture." A forested area in the form of a square, which
          "cornered" the eighty to the northeast, known as "the forty acres",
          remained in timber until after the farm passed from my father's hands.</p>
            <p>Though titles to the lands in the general area where we lived had been acquired from the Federal government
          by 1835, in the immediate vicinity of our farm, there was much uncleared land forty years later. Indeed
          "the forty acres" formed a part of a continuous forest of about twelve hundred
          acres—by everybody called the "big woods." My boyhood was spent in a sort of
          "retarded frontier" country. I saw cabin-raisings and log-rollings. I saw "Uncle
          Eleck" (Alexander) Lane<hi rend="sup">2</hi> and others make clap-boards. I saw rail-splitting often,
          and several times handled the maul and wedge myself.</p>
            <p>As fields were cleared, many fine trees were made into sawlogs which were hauled to the mills, frequently by
          ox teams. Much lime was manufactured at Delphi, and, for a number of years, a vast quantity of cord-wood was
          cut every winter to be hauled to the kilms where it was used to "burn" limestone. It was
          customary to make two loads a day from farms as far away as four or five miles. This kept man <list type="footnotes">

          of August, September and October.</p>
            <p>It was in October of 1889, that I had my short, but strenuous, experience with cord-wood. It never fell to my
          lot to cut four-foot wood, but I well remember my two rounds trip per day for a few weeks. I did not mind the
          work, or the time, or the frosty, fall mornings, but I did suffer from a foolish pride while driving through
          the county-seat to the Cartwright Lime-kiln, sitting conspicuously on top of a high load. More than a year
          earlier, I had finished high school. Now I imagined that people who saw me were saying:
          "That's young Lynch. It was generally supposed that we would amount to something, in the
          world, but he's <hi rend="i">hauling cord-wood."</hi> As I grew older, I became sure that no
          one said anything of the kind. I am now certain that most of those who observed me did not give a thought to
          my future. Perhaps a few of them entertained some such passing notion as this: "That boy may amount
          to something yet. He didn't show much promise when here in high school, but now, at least, he seems
          willing to do useful work."</p>
            <p>A great many of the families of Delphi heated their homes with wood, and thus furnished a market to farmers
          in moderate circumstances. At any rate, there were some "stove-wood farmers" in each
          neighborhood who picked up several dollars on the side each year by cutting and hauling wood to town. For a
          good many years, the price of a single wagon-box<hi rend="sup">3</hi> load of stove-wood was $1.25.
          This was not a large sum, but in the seventies and eighties, it was not to be despised. Sometimes the wood was
          sold or "engaged" in advance, and only delivery was necessary when taken to the city.
          However, in many instances, the farmers simply drove up to the hitch-rack that surrounded the courthouse
          square and wailed for a customer. Though the forests served many useful purposes, it is true that a great
          number of valuable as well as inferior trees were "deadened"<hi rend="sup">4</hi> by
          girdling in order that the ground might be brought under cultivation sooner. Whether first
          "deadened" or not, many trees were felled, cut into convenient lengths, and rolled into
          log-heaps to be burned.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi> The wagon-box was called <hi rend="i">wagon-bed</hi> by most of the people whom I
            knew when a boy. Without the additional boards that could be placed above the regular sides and ends of the
            wagon-box, it was called the <hi rend="i">single-bed</hi>, while with the extra boards it was called the <hi rend="i">double-bed.</hi>

            <p>In the days when the forests of Indiana were being rapidly destroyed, a goodly number of poor men in the
          country districts, especially during the winter months, found employment as woodcutters, loggers and
          rail-splitters, while others worked at the sawmills. These laborers, with their families, usually lived in
          small homes scattered over the country either along the edges of the forests or in the villages. These winter
          employments made it possible for enough men to dwell in rural areas to supply the extra farm help needed
          during the summer months. As the timber became scarce, farmers faced a labor problem that was solved in time
          mainly through the purchase of labor-saving machinery. Many a property-less man of the countryside was not
          lured to the city by the attractions of urban life, but was forced to go because winter work disappeared with
          the slaughter of the forests.</p>
            <p>Any mind gifted enough to find it can discover real drama anywhere. Marriage, the birth of children, the
          struggle to make a living, the necessary relations with neighbors, the uncertainties and mysteries of life,
          the continuous round of happenings, little and big, that bring happiness, anxiety, sorrow, or deep
          fear—all these are present in almost every family, and they both disturb and enrich the flowing,
          changing currents of family existence. At times the conditions that faced our family were hard. There was
          never a chance that ease and luxury would ruin us. On the whole, there was a persistent struggle that resulted
          in enough to provide a fair degree of comfort. I was the second of seven children who grew to maturity. There
          were five sisters and one brother, the latter being seven years younger than myself. A sixth sister died at
          thirteen years of age, and a second brother at eighteen months.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Years of good health,
          good crops, and good prices were well jumbled with wet years, dry years, low prices, and doctor bills. In some
          years, there was an economic advance, everything taken into consideration, but as the years passed by, there
          was a slow but sure increase in the modest debt that encumbered the land from the beginning.</p>
            <p>Both my father and mother were eager that each child should have all the educational advantages that could be
          provided. <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">5</hi> The sister died a week after being caught in a cold spring rain when on the way
              to school. Probably no serious results would have followed, but for the fact that the teacher arrived late
              on that important morning which made it necessary for pupils to stand outside in the chilly air. A
              "congestive chill" followed which ran into pneumonia. The little boy died from an
              abscess that formed in one lung, due to a grain of corn being accidentally drawn down into the base of a
              bronchial tube.</item>

               <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-032-2-089"/> The country school which we attended was a good mile and a quarter from
          our home. It was known as the Plank Road School,<hi rend="sup">6</hi> and was in District 5 of Deer Creek
          Township. Until the day of consolidation, there were eight district schools within this township outside of
          Delphi. I learned to read fairly well, spell poorly (mostly by sound), and count some, as a result of a little
          occasional teaching at home before I was six. A few days after my sixth anniversary, I began my school career.
          My first teacher was Dallas Odell, a scion of a pioneer family. I remember him as a kind man, who taught the
          older classes with a good deal of enthusiasm. Naturally he had not much time for beginners, but I made fair
          progress in reading and learned a little in the field of numbers. By the end of the six-months term, I could
          spell all the words in the Elementary Spelling Book from <hi rend="i">go</hi> to <hi rend="i">perpendicular</hi> and <hi rend="i">parallel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the next three years, I moved along regularly, as far as that was possible, I suppose, in a large and
          very irregular school which included pupils from six to eighteen or twenty years of age in all stages of
          advancement. The school-house was a red-brown frame building from which the ground sloped gently away on the
          west and south. Many fine things have been written about the "little red school-houses," and
          they did indeed serve a great purpose. They did not, however, serve the pupils well in every way. At the Plank
          Road School, there were always several boys who were very profane and vulgar in speech, and there was almost
          nothing that a boy was not obliged to learn on the play-ground. I fear that this was true in too many country
          schools all over the land.</p>
            <p>In the summer following my second year in school, I went through a long illness, the only one of a serious
          nature during my entire life. Our family physician, Dr. I. N. Cochran, pronounced the disease
          "brain-fever," which was, I suppose, another name for typhoid fever. One bad result of this
          sickness was that I was induced to believe that I must be <list type="footnotes">

              An occasional plank in a mud-hole or at the side of the road was all that was left of this ambitious
              venture in road building, at the time of my earliest recollections. One of these discarded boards caught
              in the wheel of a passing wagon, suddenly raising one side of the wagon off the ground and throwing out a
              woman occupant. The accident, which happened a quarter of a mile from our home about 1879, resulted
              fatally.</item>

          was a freshman in high-school, I did not engage strenuously enough in rough and tumble sports with other boys.</p>
            <p>In the early spring of 1879, I had an experience that is perhaps worth telling. The Prince William Road
          passed to the west of the school nearly a half mile and angled to the southeast. By following a line-fence
          that ran due south from the east side of the school-yard, one came to the angling road and saved quite a
          little distance. When the roads were bad, my older sister and myself often took this
          "short-cut" along with three of the Ashby children who then lived just northwest of us. A
          small run, Bridge Creek, flowed through a valley south of the school-yard. On the evening of my story, the
          creek, swollen by heavy rains, was out of its banks. To cross, it was necessary to climb along the rail-fence
          for perhaps fifty yards. Fred Ashby was far in the lead and I was next. The two Ashby girls and my sister were
          trailing me, probably fifty feet. I came to higher ground between the winding creek and flooded area already
          passed over and a new channel about eight feet wide, six feet deep, and one hundred twenty-five feet long,
          that had recently been cut in an attempt to straighten the course of the stream. This new channel was just
          about bank full. I was not familiar with it. I looked ahead, and, believing that the young man in front of me
          must have waded this narrow bit of water, I stepped into the rushing current. I immediately learned that this
          was a serious blunder.</p>
            <p>My light body was carried swiftly under the fence—a straight rail panel that reached across the
          cut from bank to bank. There was not much time to think. I did not know how to swim, but, for some
          unaccountable reason, I did not strangle though I went under several times after the first plunge. I recall
          very distinctly that the thought came to my mind: "I must try to swim." I am sure that I
          paddled and kicked some as the current hurried me along. Something over one hundred feet from where I took the
          plunge, I gained a footing and was able to stand in the water which came just about to my shoulders.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <list type="footnotes">
               <item>
                  <hi rend="sup">8</hi> My impression was that, as I was swept along, I was finally able to touch bottom
            with my knees and that I was on my knees when Mr. Ashby reached me. He maintained that, when he took hold of
            my arm at the shoulder, I began to walk. Assuming that he must have been correct, I have given his story
            rather than mine</item>
            </list>
            <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-032-2-091"/>
            <p>Meanwhile the three girls, who were making their way on the fence behind, saw me going down the narrow
          channel and raised a great outcry. The teacher, John Ashby, an older brother of the Ashby children, heard the
          distress signals, ran from the school building, leaped the play-ground fence, ran down the hill and into the
          water to rescue me. I was in a safe place before his arrival, but whether I could have waded out in either
          direction is a question. The teacher declared that he waded water above his waist while coming in after me,
          but that was before he reached the more shallow water where I was marooned.</p>
            <p>I was neither injured nor frightened and walked home with the girls who generously placed some shawls or
          coats around me. Even the thorough wetting in the chilly water did not affect me. My companions guarded me
          carefully on the way home as they had been thoroughly scared. I must have felt very well, because I pretended
          to be frightened whenever we passed hollow places filled with water. I laughed inwardly when the older Ashby
          girl said softly to the others: "Poor little boy. He's afraid of water now."</p>
            <p>I spent nine years in that country school, at least one more than the regulation number. In those days one
          often promoted himself, as he saw fit, or took up new subjects ahead of time if he wished. Taking it by and
          large, the school was a good one for its day. I believe that the teachers through whose hands I passed were
          above the general run. I am certain, however, that I was furnished with only about half enough work in seven
          out of nine years. It was during my sixth and eighth years that I was taught by a really superior teacher,
          Miss Alice M. Crowder, who afterwards married a man by the name of Sharp. She was accurate and efficient,
          asked for real work and got it. Under her instruction, I learned more about how to work and gained more
          inspiration than I did either before or afterwards, until I was beyond high school.</p>
            <p>It was the custom during the earlier years of my period in the country school for spelling classes, when
          called, to line up in front of the school. The words in the lesson were pronounced by the teacher and spelled
          by the pupils in turn beginning<list type="footnotes">
                  <item>on this point. It is possible that as I reached the end of the new channel, I was swept toward the
              right bank of the old creek bed. In this case, I probably did land on my knees on the water-covered bank,
              and I may have succeeded in getting to my feet before my rescuer got hold of me.</item>
               </list>
               <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-032-2-092"/> at the head of the class. If any one in the line misspelled a word, the
          first one below who succeeded in spelling it correctly went above the first to miss. On some days, there was
          not a single failure. On other days, one, two or more words were spelled incorrectly. The one who stood at the
          head of the class at the end of the lesson started at the foot on the next school day. A mark was placed in
          the teacher's record book after the name of the one who stood in the first place each day. This was
          called a head-mark and often, as the school year approached the end, there were two or three pupils who were
          running a close race. It was an honor to win the largest number of head-marks during the year. Twice at least,
          I received the prize that was given to the winner. The second time, I was tied with a boy, a bit older than
          myself, who was in the same class, only a week before the last day of school. My turn would regularly come
          first for the next mark, and there would not be enough days for my dangerous rival to work to the top after
          me, unless two or three members of the class should fail to spell well. There was a good deal of interest in
          the race, and some who were friendly to me urged the pupils who stood higher in the line than my rival to work
          unusually hard on their lessons, which they did. The consequence was that my friend, Frank Myres, was about
          two places below the head of the line when the last set of words were pronounced and the prize fell to me.</p>
            <p>Three or four years later, I went to the nearest school in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
               </placeName> Township (Silver Beach) to attend a spelling match at night. I did not expect to go, but an older
          boy came past our home and promised to look after me if my parents would permit me to accompany him. I was
          happy to hear a favorable answer. The distance was little more than a mile. For about half the distance, we
          walked south on the railroad and then west on a narrow and not much used high-way. I was a slender lad, twelve
          years of age, at the time, and somewhat frightened when all who wished to participate in the contest stood up
          in a line that reached entirely around the room, myself with the rest. There were some casualties on each
          round, but I happened to spell correctly the words that fell to me. After about forty minutes, the crowd was
          astonished to find that the only persons left standing were myself and a young man about twice my age. For a
          short time each of us continued to spell correctly, one <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-032-2-093"/> after the other,
          the words pronounced to us. I had no thought of winning, but I did my best. The word <hi rend="i">plateau</hi>
          came to the tall young men who stood near me, which to my surprise, he spelled <hi rend="i">platteau.</hi> The
          master of ceremonies said clearly and with some excitement, "next," and I came through
          triumphantly. The spelling match was over and we started home. Several boys walked eastward along the road.
          There was a small amount of snow on the ground and some one came along with a team and bob-sled. The boys all
          jumped on except myself. I made the attempt but failed and was left alone with about three quarters of a mile
          to cover at ten o'clock at night. I was not particularly happy, but since there was nothing else to
          do I trudged along toward home, arriving safely, with some big news to tell at breakfast the next morning.</p>
            <p>I was not much interested in winning laurels as a speller, and I attended very few spelling matches as I grew
          older. There were persons in many communities who became expert spellers. Miss Sue Wingard of our neighborhood
          and John Gillam of the next school district eastward were known far and wide as champions. They took part in
          many contests and usually one or the other was the victor wherever they might appear. In the eighties, the
          ciphering match tended to supersede the spelling match. By the end of the century one seldom heard of either,
          though local contests within single schools continued to be held on Friday afternoons for some years after
          interest had waned in regard to public matches.</p>
