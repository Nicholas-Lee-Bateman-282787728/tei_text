            "A Primitive Method of Enforcing the Law" Vigilantism as a Response to Bank
                    Crimes in Indiana, 1925-1933
            PAUL MUSGRAVE
            On May 29, 1933, hundreds of vigilantes captured three men in the woods just outside Culver, Indiana.
                    Their quarry was the last of a gang who had stolen more than $12,000 from the State
                    Exchange Bank in Culver that morning. Armed with shotguns, the robbers had entered the bank at 9:07;
                    while some of them watched over the bank's customers and employees, their leader ordered
                    the assistant cashier to open the vault, which the gang members then emptied. Alerted by a telephone
                    call from a bank employee in an adjacent office, a group of local vigilantes (soon numbering five
                    hundred, including ten officers from the Culver Military Academy) quickly mobilized and surrounded
                    the bank. Using two captives as human shields, the bandits ran to their getaway car. As they sped
                    away, the bank president's son, perched on a nearby building's roof, shot and
                    killed the driver. The car overturned, but the surviving bandits stole another one, leaving their
                    hostages in a ditch.

                            , Indiana, bank vigilantes H. C. Watson, W. C. Hinkle, and D. E. Watson (1. to
                            r.) are shown with their trophy from a state shooting competition. In the 1920s, these men,
                            like hundreds of other Hoosiers, acted as civilian law enforcement in response to a growing
                            number of state bank robberies. The Hoosier Banker, July 1927
                After crashing into a tree ten miles out of town, they fled on foot into the woods, where
                    the vigilantes apprehended them piecemeal over the next few hours.1
            
            Similar events took place in many communities in Indiana and the rest of the 
                        United States
                     during the 1920s and early 1930s, at a time when many observers believed that crime had
                    reached a new high. Banks were frequent targets of criminal activity; Indiana bankers lost about a
                    million dollars (ten million in inflation-adjusted terms) to robbers during the 1920s.2 Facing revenue losses and increased insurance costs, as well as threats to the safety of
                    their employees and customers, Indiana's bankers responded by lobbying for greater
                    government action

                            General Assembly of Bankers" (Indiana University Archives, 
                                Bloomington

                     against crime and by organizing vigilance committees to defend
                    their property and their communities. The Indiana Bankers Association (IBA) was the driving force
                    behind both the lobbying and the vigilance efforts.
            Because of the pivotal role the bankers played in the vigilance committee movement, I will refer to
                    its participants as "bank vigilantes." Bankers, and the vigilantes they sponsored,
                    were primarily concerned with order, not justice (except in the roughest sense). Examining their
                    actions offers a window onto democratic norms in Indiana. A student of policing reforms in the 
                        United Kingdom
                     writes, "decision-making power in policing â€¦ exemplifies the
                    fundamental conception of democracy present in that political system"; similarly, an expert
                    on the French police hypothesizes that "[t]he way in which the state ensures public order
                    in its national territory expresses the degree of development of democracy in that state, as much as
                    does its respect for public freedoms or the freedom of the press."3 The
                    issue of how policing power is exercised is especially meaningful when the
                    "police" under scrutiny are fundamentally private agents funded primarily by
                    private groups with private aims.
            Evidence from the IBA and its magazine, the Hoosier Banker, as well as selected
                    archival documents from the association's sometime field secretary and contemporaneous
                    newspaper accounts of bank robberies, form the basis for this article. Although such sources present
                    almost exclusively the official line of the bank vigilante leadership, there are few alternatives to
                    relying on them. Other points of view are scarce: few writers defended the bank robbers, and the
                    robbers themselves rarely essayed justifications for their actions. But a close reading of the
                    available evidence reveals a fairly complete picture. Even among bankers, support for vigilantism
                    was far from unanimous, whether because of principle or fear. Popular attitudes toward bank robbers
                    were also complex: some criminals, such as John Dillinger, became celebrities. Viewed in context,
                    the Hoosier Banker's efforts at propagandizing for the vigilantes can be
                    read not just as self-congratulatory missives but as attempts to sway the general public and the
                    IBA's own membership.

                     Scrutiny of official texts can therefore illuminate the range
                    of attitudes in the general public, officialdom, and the banking community regarding vigilantism; in
                    so doing it sheds light on the evolution of the relationship of the state to society and on beliefs
                    about the legitimate use of force.
            WHAT A VIGILANTE WAS (AND WASN'T)
            Long associated with the American frontier, the term "vigilante" today suggests
                    "a nondescript midnight rider, blatantly ignorant, conventional, racist, and indiscriminate
                    in the use of violence against people and institutions."4 In reality,
                    however, vigilantism was not confined to the West, and those who took part were not exclusively, or
                    even mainly, thugs. Between 1767 and 1910, Americans organized vigilante groups in almost every part
                    of the country, except for a few of the more settled eastern states.5 Their
                    leaders were often members of the local elite, as were many of their followers and supporters. The
                    latter group included two presidents (Andrew Jackson and Theodore Roosevelt), at least five U.S.
                    senators, a congressman, eight governors, and scores of other officials, as well as business
                    leaders, such as Leland 
                        Stanford
                    . As one later commentator concluded, " [t]hese people were anything but
                    members of a backward, hell-for-leather rabble."6 Nevertheless,
                    vigilantes (sometimes known as "regulators," because they attempted to
                    "regulate" the public's morals) were often brutal. The early
                    nineteenth-century English traveler William Faux, for example, recorded that after two men robbed
                    and killed a traveler, regulators hanged one thief and flogged the other almost to death. Another
                    group of regulators executed a murderer and left his head on a pole as a warning.7
            
            Vigilante activity was recorded in Indiana at least as early as the 1820s.8
                    Between the 1820s and the late 1850s, there were doubtless vigilante groups scattered throughout the
                    state, although I have found

                     evidence of only one, the 
                        Marshall County
                     Watchmen.9 The state's bestknown vigilante group, the
                    Regulators of Northern Indiana, formed in 1858. (This was the second major attempt by residents to
                    organize such a group. An effort in the 1840s had failed because of ineptitude: the criminals
                    themselves had attended the committee's meetings.)10 Chief among the
                    Regulators' concerns was horse theft, a serious problem because horses were both a means of
                    transportation and a major financial asset. Indeed, many antebellum vigilante associations around
                    the country (including the Watchmen) focused on the issue.11 But the Regulators
                    also took it upon themselves to deal with robbery, burglary, arson, counterfeiting, and murder.12 In addition, they alleged that criminals' hiding places contained
                    "a number of lewd women," with "every allurement that men can use for the
                    ruin of your sons, to drag them down into the pit of infamy and shame." The pivotal moment
                    of a months-long campaign was the execution of a thief who had been convicted by a
                    "jury" of hundreds-the crowd that had gathered for his "trial."
                    The Regulators marched their prisoner toward the gallows behind a banner reading "No expense to the County." "[0]n this memorable day he was
                    executed," the group's historian M. H. Mott later wrote, "not by a
                    rabble, not by a noisy mob, not by young men in the heat of passion, but by men who for years have
                    been residents of this and the adjoining counties." After the execution, confessions
                    "became fashionable": "[Those questioned by the Regulators] would turn
                    pale and tremble, so that it was with much difficulty that they could answer questions-so strong
                    were their fears of being hung by the Regulators."13

            Like many nineteenth-century vigilantes, the Regulators believed that the primary purpose of a
                    criminal justice system was retribution (and thus the deterrence of other criminals), overriding
                    procedural niceties such as appeals or evidentiary standards. Mott justified the
                    Regulators' actions along such lines by invoking a sense of crisis: "the civil
                    laws are totally inadequate to the protection of the property of our citizens against the
                    depredations of the vampires, who curse the earth with their presences, living upon plunder taken
                    from the honest, the industrious, and often the indigent portion of the community." The
                    Regulators further defended their measures by arguing that
            
                    the people of this country are the real sovereigns, and that whenever the laws, made by those to
                        whom they have delegated their authority, are found inadequate to their protection, it is the
                        right of the people to take the protection of their property into their own hands, and deal with
                        these villains according to their just deserts.14
               
                
            "[T]he will of the mass is the law of the land" in a democratic society, Mott
                    wrote, "whether it be [expressed] by legislative enactment, or by the spontaneous outburst
                    of indignation against a combined force that are plotting the ruin of the country."15 This right was enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, he contended,
                    but it was "a right which [a citizen] holds also by the charter given him by the God of the
                        universe."16 Such ideas were common at the time. William Culberson,
                    a modern historian of vigilantism, summarizes the view: "If people had the right to make
                    their own laws and to elect their own officials, then in pioneer logic it followed that people had
                    the right to change laws or overrule officials." Thus, because "the
                    people" were "the ultimate and only legitimate basis for government,"
                    they "possess [ed] the right to reform, alter, or abolish their government at any
                    time" (and also, in the views of many, by any means).17 Since
                    "there were certain functions

                     [necessary to preserve] public order that the legal authorities
                    would not, could not, or should not be expected to perform," some of the people themselves
                    assumed these functions as vigilantes-and saw their activities "as an act of public spirit
                    as importantâ€¦ as the election of upright officials."18
            
            Not all private groups that employed violence were vigilance committees. Two relatively well-known
                    groups in Indiana history prove the point. The "white caps" were first recorded in
                    1887 in Indiana and later spread across the nation. White caps whipped those they accused of being
                    "wife beaters, drunkards, poor providers, immoral couples and individuals, lazy and
                    shiftless men, and petty neighborhood thieves." There are solid grounds for not classing
                    them as vigilantes. They operated wholly in secret, and their members usually wore masks or other
                    disguises-a far cry from the public (if illegal) trial the Regulators had held and the documents,
                    including constitutions, that mainstream vigilance committees made public.19
                    Furthermore, government officials condemned the actions of the white caps. After white caps attacked
                    two female students in Dunn Meadow in the heart of Indiana University's campus in April
                    1903, Governor Winfield Durbin informed the 
                        Monroe County
                     sheriff that because there had been "no serious effortâ€¦ to prevent
                    [such lawlessness] or bring punishment to those who have thus inflicted disgrace upon 
                        Monroe County
                     and the State of Indiana," he would recommend to the legislature that the
                    university be moved to a safer community unless the situation improved.20 No
                    such opprobrium attached to the bank vigilantes twenty-five years later.
            The Indiana Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s was also not a vigilante society. True, some Klansmen organized
                    under the long-moribund state law that allowed citizens to form associations to catch horse thieves
                    and other criminals (the statute that had sanctioned the Regulators), but their activities were
                    mainly limited to helping the authorities prosecute those who violated Prohibition.21 Despite the Klan's reputation, the group in the 1920s appears not to have

                     used force against blacks, Jews, Catholics, or others.22 In his study of the Klan in 
                        Noblesville
                    , Allen Safianow concludes that although the Klan's horse-thief detective
                    association held frequent meetings and "targeted bootleggers, gambling establishments, and
                    other moral transgressors," it rarely, if ever, used physical violence against minorities
                    (although one group of "night riders" apparently coerced an Asian immigrant into
                    leaving the area).23 The Klan hardly needed to resort to such crude tactics. It
                    exercised formidable power by other means: the group helped to elect the governor, a majority of
                    both houses of the General Assembly, most of the state's congressmen, and a host of local
                    officials. At its peak, the Klan's membership in Indiana included hundreds of thousands of
                    men in the KKK proper and tens of thousands more in the Women of the Ku Klux Klan and the Junior
                    Klan (a children's group)-more Hoosiers than belonged to the American Legion or the
                    Methodist church.24 Most of the Klan's members apparently thought the
                    group was "little different from [the] Rotary or [the] Elks" (although, as
                    Safianow notes of the county in his study, "the Invisible Empire could not have achieved
                    such tremendous supportâ€¦ had there not been a strong base of bigotry to draw
                        on").25Because the Klan refrained from organized violence and was
                    not principally an anti-crime group, it was not a vigilante society-although it is statistically
                    almost certain that the membership in the Klan and in the bank vigilantes' organizations
                    overlapped to some degree.26
            
            Nor is vigilantism synonymous with lynching. Lynch mobs normally lacked a discernible hierarchy,
                    assembled quickly, and dispersed immediately after the lynching. Vigilance committees, on the other
                    hand, were well-organized and lasted for weeks, months, or years. They held public meetings, adopted
                    constitutions and bylaws, and elected officers. They were also less bloodthirsty than lynch mobs.
                    Over the course of a century and a half, all vigilante groups combined probably killed fewer than a
                    thousand people throughout the

                     lynch mobs killed nearly five thousand.27
                    In Indiana alone, forty-one whites and eleven African Americans were lynched between 1882 and
                        1903.28 In an 1899 article in the Yale Law Journal,
                    Theodore Roosevelt's future attorney general, Charles J. Bonaparte, despite deploring
                    "the frequency and impunity of lynchings" as "serious and
                    disquieting," concluded that lynchers intended "not to violate, but to vindicate,
                    the law" and urged measures that would make the legal system more like lynch law.29 By the 1920s, attitudes in most of the country had turned against lynching,
                    but this disapproval did not stop the practice entirely, as the wellknown events of August 1930 in 
                        Marion
                    , Indiana, made brutally clear.30 Nevertheless, in many states,
                    officials who were suspected of cooperating with lynchers-or who were simply in office when a
                    lynching occurred-could face stiff fines or lose their jobs. Vigilantes rarely faced such social or
                    legal reprisals, and vigilantism enjoyed far greater public support and respectability than
                    lynching.
            CREATION, ORGANIZATION, AND ACTIONS OF THE BANK VIGILANTES
            The bank vigilantes of the 1920s and 1930s were superficially similar in some respects to earlier
                    groups such as the Regulators. After all, vigilantes in both centuries employed deadly force with,
                    at most, only the thinnest of legal sanctions. The differences, however, were more significant than
                    their similarities. On the frontier, vigilantes often operated in a legal vacuum and often
                    justified, even celebrated, their deeds as an expression of pure democracy. But the leaders of the
                    vigilante movement in the 1920s and 1930s saw their actions not only as the fulfillment of their
                    civic duty but as a temporary expedient necessitated by the

                    vigilantes operated over far more territory, displayed far more complex activities and organization,
                    and, most important, took up arms more grudgingly than had their predecessors. Indeed, the
                    vigilantes' sponsors and organizers sought to shift the burden of providing public order to
                    the state government, and the groups disbanded after the state set up a modern police force.
            During the 1920s, the incidence of crimes that most concerned bankers, such as forgeries, burglaries,
                    and holdups, more than doubled in Indiana.31 This increase in bank crime
                    paralleled a general increase in lawbreaking. By 1930, the average daily population of state penal
                    and correctional institutions was 6,499, an increase from 4,823 in 1925 and 2,930 in 1920. Indiana
                    sent about 8,600 men, women, and children to its jails and correctional institutions in 1930,
                    compared with 2,153 in 1920.32 The 121.8 percent increase in the average
                    population of the state's jails and prisons and the 299.4 percent increase in the number of
                    commitments between 1920 and 1930 far outpaced the 11.2 percent increase in Indiana's
                    population over the same period. Banks were frequent targets of criminals, not least because there
                    were large numbers of them, especially in outlying areas, before the onset of the Great Depression
                    (and particularly before the Bank Holiday in 1933).
            The number of state-chartered banks (shown as "state banks" in the table on the
                    following page) rose from 1916 to 1924, a situation contemporaneous observers attributed to lax
                    regulation and speculation.33 These banks, often small and located in rural
                    areas, were easy pickings for robbers and were guaranteed to have cash on hand.
            Indiana's decrepit law enforcement agencies were unable to cope with the surge in crime. Law
                    enforcement was then the responsibility of municipal police forces, county sheriffs, and township
                    constables. One obstacle they all faced was the weak rural economy. Farm prices had

                plummeted by forty percent in 1920-1921, and they never returned to wartime levels.35 Already saddled with debt, many farmers went bankrupt, causing local tax
                    revenues to fall and hobbling local police agencies' ability to equip their officers
                    adequately. As one official reported in 1929, "It is impossible to take an automobile that
                    will run sixty miles an hour and expect to catch a crook in a car that runs seventy-five or eighty
                    miles an hour. It is equally impossible for an officer to take a 38-caliber

                    were manifestly unsuited for their jobs. A study of Indiana law enforcement officials in 1934 found
                    that only one-third had educations beyond the eighth grade and that only five percent had attended
                        college.37 Most policemen and sheriff's deputies entered law
                    enforcement between the ages of twenty-seven and forty, after working in industry.38 Even beat officers were more experienced than sheriffs, not one of whom, according to a
                    1935 state report, had previous law enforcement experience, and all of whom had held their positions
                    for an average of only three years.39
            
            Law enforcement officials did not become more fit for their jobs the longer they stayed on the force.
                    An investigation by a state committee found that city police agencies frequently hired officers not
                    because of their ability or experience but rather because of their political connections. Such
                    hiring practices bred insecurity among officers, sixty percent of whom believed they would lose
                    their job if a different political party took office.40 The committee also
                    hinted at corruption in many municipal agencies: "[I]n many instances, [officers] are
                    selected not to apprehend all criminals, but to prevent the apprehension of certain classes or
                    groups." Sheriffs and their deputies, the committee concluded, were hardly in better shape:
                    "Few, if any, sheriffs have created a force out of their deputies that bear the slightest
                    resemblance to a modern police force."41 Despite officers'
                    inexperience and lack of formal education, few agencies trained their officers after hiring them. As
                    a state commission wrote in 1935, "It seems that, contrary to the practice with reference
                    to other vocations and professions where a disciplinary training period is required, the
                    police['s] knowledge and ability are supposed, like Topsy, to 'USt
                    grow.â€™ "42 In fact, a majority of all officers surveyed,

                     marshals to state policemen, opposed giving civil service
                    protection to law enforcement officers.43 Many officers likely feared that
                    merit-based hiring would cost them their jobs.
            Focusing on the shortcomings of local law enforcement, however, overlooks the state
                    government's failure to adapt to the challenges posed by criminals' adoption of
                    new technologies. The structure of law enforcement agencies had been designed when the horse was the
                    fastest mode of transportation, but the automobile gave criminals the ability to commit a crime in 
                        Evansville
                     in the morning and by nightfall be in 
                        South Bend
                    -or 
                  Tennessee, Missouri
               , or 
                        Pennsylvania
                    . The lack of an effective statewide law enforcement agency compounded the difficulties.
                    Although the officers of the State Motor Vehicle Police (created by the General Assembly in 1921)
                    patrolled the entire state, their authority was limited to apprehending automobile thieves. The
                    legislature expanded the motor vehicle police's jurisdiction slightly in 1925, but officers
                    still could not arrest a known criminal unless he violated traffic regulations.44 The force's equipment and training were as minimal as its authority. An official
                    history of the Indiana State Police records that "[w]orn out cars and dilapidated
                    motorcycles were the only patrol vehicles." Since there was no statewide police radio,
                    officers had to telephone headquarters at thirty-minute intervals.45 Most
                    important, for most of the decade the force had only sixteen officers.46
            
            Believing the government unable to protect them, many bankers decided to protect themselves. One
                    contemporary observer of rural law enforcement wrote that 
                        smaller banks [have assumed] the appearance of fortifications. To the traditional vaults,
                            alarms, and time locks were added armor plate, bullet proof glass, rifles and shotguns. The
                            tellers and officers of these banks have become accustomed to carrying revolvers and
                            automatic pistols on their persons.47

                     had installed a "bullet-proof boiler plate
                    â€˜pill-boxâ€™" with "thick steel plates three and a half feet
                    high" overlooking its lobby, from which "a man could sit with safety and fire upon
                    bandits." The cashier explained that the bank's three bookkeepers were
                    "thoroughly schooled in rifles and revolver fire" and, in the event of a holdup,
                    "would be able to take care of the situation."49
            
            Concerned by the inability of existing government institutions to fight crime, the IBA lobbied the
                    General Assembly to fund an effective state police. In states with such forces, the Hoosier Banker argued, "bankers have learned that the semi-military highly
                    trained state trooper 'untouched by politics, owing allegiance only to the state, its laws
                    and the people who stand behind these laws,' is the most effective agency for order and law
                        enforcement."50 In 1931, the Indiana Committee on Observance and
                    Enforcement of Law (a group appointed by Governor Harry Leslie which included the IBA's
                    then-president) also urged the creation of a state police force.51 Observers
                    looked to agencies in states such as 
                  Pennsylvania, Michigan
               , and 
                        Massachusetts
                     as models, and praised the emphasis these forces placed on professionalism. Recruits
                    for 
                        Pennsylvania
                    's state police, for instance, had to be young and physically fit and undergo
                    extensive training once hired. Their pay matched their qualifications: a sergeant in the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     force earned as much as the average Indiana sheriff.52
            
            The IBAs lobbying for a state police force made little headway for years. The association was more
                    successful in other efforts, such as persuading the legislature to create the Bureau of Criminal
                    Identification and Investigation in 1927. The Hoosier Banker editorialized that
                    the bureau's establishment took Indiana "out of the class of states still using
                    horse-and-buggy methods of catching motorized criminals."53 The new

                     agency assisted in investigations in areas where local agencies
                    lacked the resources to probe crimes independently, but its focus was on categorizing, filing, and
                    distributing fingerprint records, thus giving a sheriff in Noble County, for instance, the ability
                    to identify a criminal last seen in New 
                        Albany
                    . Fingerprinting, which had only recently superseded the Bertillion system of
                    identifying criminals by measurements of their body parts, also allowed the bureau to coordinate its
                    work with the law enforcement agencies of other states and of the federal government.54 In the same legislative session (the IBAs "most successful" ever, the
                        Hoosier Banker wrote), the General Assembly made it a felony for a convicted
                    felon to possess burglary tools with intent to commit a crime, and also declared burglary with
                    explosives, electricity, or gas a felony crime. Perhaps most important, the IBA satisfied the
                    "universal demand of bankers for drastic penalties for bank banditry" by securing
                    the passage of a bill providing for a minimum term of ten years for bank robbery-and a maximum term
                    of life.55
            
            But the centerpiece of the IBAs anti-banditry efforts was its vigilante program. Indiana was not the
                    only-or the first-state to boast a statewide organization. A scholar at 
                        Columbia
                     University noted at the time that "the disturbing rise in attacks upon rural
                    banks, a striking feature of our crime record during the last decade, has been attended by a revival
                    of protective groups."56 He attributed private citizens'
                    efforts to "defend their lives and their property from attack" to the ineptitude
                    of sheriffs and township constables, whom he called "ancient institutions tottering towards
                        oblivion."57 The earliest such organization emerged in 
                        Iowa
                    , where the state bankers' association had organized 3,800 trained vigilantes
                    in 1923. In the first half of that year, there were no bank robberies in 
                        Iowa
                    -a record that attracted the attention of bankers nationwide.58 The
                    IBA's interest in the new method of organization was doubtless further piqued after 1924,
                    when the latest statistics revealed that two-thirds of the nation's bank robberies were
                    committed in only

                        Texas
                    . In 1924 alone, thirty-two Indiana banks were held up, suffering losses of nearly
                    seventy thousand dollars.59 In response, the IBA launched its own vigilante
                    program in 1925, as did bankers in 
                  Illinois,
                            Kansas
               , and 
                        Oklahoma
                    .60 At the IBA's summer convention in 
                        Indianapolis
                     that year, the group's members pledged to organize vigilance committees in
                    every county, with a goal of mustering 4,000 to 5,000 men statewide, and they immediately requested
                    "twelve volunteers from every Indiana National Guard unit." The IB As decision
                    came on the same day as the robbery of 
                        Indianapolis
                    's Sixteenth Street State Bank, the second daylight robbery in that city in a
                    fortnight and the thirtieth bank robbery in the state within several weeks.61 By
                    May 1926, sixty-two Indiana counties had vigilance committees.62
            
            The IBA recognized only those vigilance committees that had been set up by the county banking
                    association and whose members had been deputized by the county sheriff.63 The
                    sheriff or another local law enforcement official frequently led the groups.64
                    (In 
                  Dearborn, Switzerland
               , and 
                        Ohio
                     counties, the State Motor Police helped organize committees.)65 IBA
                    member banks funded the organizations, and one source mentions that bankers' associations
                    provided the sheriff with "a liability insurance policy to indemnify the sheriff against
                    loss due to the acts of such deputy."66 The groups were well armed.
                    LaPorte County's vigilantes each received a .45 caliber revolver from their
                    county's bankers' association to supplement the rifles and sawed-off shotguns that
                    many of them already owned. The

                            sheriffs, and vigilantes in a multi-county area. The Hoosier Banker, May

                    the sheriff, his deputy, and "several members of the vigilance committee" would be
                    taught how to use it.67 The 
                        Clinton County
                     association purchased an airplane with a machine gun, flares, and spotlights in order
                    to chase robbers by day or night.68 To improve vigilantes' accuracy,
                    the 1BA sponsored a series of annual marksmanship competitions at Fort Benjamin Harrison beginning
                    in June 1926.69
            
            In theory, following the report of a bank robbery, vigilante units in several counties would set up
                    roadblocks and pursue the bandits once sighted. Communications were crucial: although criminals
                    might be able to outrace sheriffs' deputies, they could not outrun the telephone. When the
                    plan worked, it brought impressive results. After a robbery in the hamlet of Mount Summit, some
                    vigilantes trailed the bandits while others telephoned neighboring cities with the news, alerting
                    the sheriff in 
                        New Castle
                    , the county seat, before the criminals had left town. Within hours of the robbery, the
                    robbers had been captured, had confessed, and had been sentenced to twenty-five years in jail.
                    (Ironically, the cashier of the Mount Summit State Bank was the chairman of the IBA's
                    statewide protective organization.)70 In December 1930, Hazel Haase, the chief
                    telephone operator in Clinton, in 
                        Vermillion County
                    , coordinated vigilantes and police officers as they chased criminals who had robbed the
                    Citizens' Bank. During the pursuit, the robbers killed a deputy sheriff with machine-gun
                    fire. After cornering the bandits in a farm in nearby Sidell, 
                        Illinois
                    , the posse "began the final gun battle with the robbers," killing
                    three and recovering $15,000. The three men's bodies were "hauled from
                    Sidellâ€¦ to the county poor farm and placed in the paupers' ditch," the
                        Hoosier Banker later reported.71 The magazine credited the
                    successful outcome to Haase's "energetic, cool-headed use of the
                        telephone."72

            As such incidents demonstrate, bank robberies and vigilantes' raids were violent. After a
                    robbery in Dunkirk, fifty miles south of Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , a "counter-attack on bandits resulted in swift death for one of four robbers
                    of the First State Bankâ€¦ and immediate capture of the three others. Confessions and
                    recovery of the entire loot were other quick developments of the Dunkirk raid."73 During the November 1928 holdup of the Sulphur Springs State Bank in 
                        Henry County
                     in central Indiana, robbers told the bank's cashier to stand up and put his
                    hands in the air; when the cashier, who was crippled, reached for his crutches, the criminals
                    panicked and shot him in the neck.74 In the summer of 1929, bank vigilantes from
                    Etna Green in 
                        Kosciusko County
                     in northwest Indiana captured a group of criminals-after the robbers had shot 
                        Warsaw
                    's chief of police.75 Bank heists in December 1930 in Etna
                    Green and Burket led to the brief kidnapping of a 79-year-old postman, the fatal wounding of a
                    bandit, the shooting of a bank employee, and the eventual capture of all of the robbers.76 And in October 1931, four unmasked men robbed the Citizens' State
                    Bank in the town of 
                        Hartford
                     City in northwest Indiana's 
                        Blackford County
                    , taking $8,000 and, for fifteen minutes, the town's mayor.77
            
            The IBA believed that vigilantes produced results. In October 1926, IBA secretary Forba McDaniel
                    reported that the number of bank holdups had fallen by 79 percent since 1925, a success she
                    attributed to the organization's "statewide Protective Plan" (as the
                    vigilante program was sometimes called).78 By the end of the decade, most
                    Indiana counties had organized vigilante groups, and the number of crimes against banks was falling.
                    When Herman B Wells, later president of Indiana University but first a prominent figure in the
                    state's banking industry, became the IBAs field secretary in 1928, his responsibilities
                    included organizing vigilante groups. In an undated speech, probably delivered in the year the

                     association hired him, Wells described the vigilantes'
                    success to the association, concluding that "banks unprotected by vigilantes are about
                    twice as likely to be held up as are those that are so protected." He reported that 40
                    percent of the holdups in 1927 had taken place in the 25 percent of counties in Indiana that lacked
                    a vigilance committee. Nevertheless, the IBA was dissatisfied: 
                        All of this progress in combating crime has been made at the expense of the banks in the
                            state. In other words, although the state government assures us complete protection and an
                            orderly society in which to do business-citizens of the commonwealth, it has not heretofore
                            delivered. We have footed the bill ourselves and that obviously is not right.79
                  
                     The association's desire to trim its expenses fueled its lobbying for the creation
                    of a state police force. So did the fact (which grew even more apparent as the years brought more
                    bank heists) that vigilantes, expensive and far-reaching as their activities were, could not solve
                    the crime problem by themselves.
            Other states' experience with bank robbers and vigilantes mirrored Indiana's.

                    , for instance, 
                        looked with alarm on both the rising tide of daylight robberies and the rising cost of their
                            insurance. In 1925 members of the 
                                Minnesota
                             Bankers Association (MBA), convinced that governmental law-enforcement
                            authorities could not help them, took matters into their own hands. The MBA proposed that
                            its members form groups of "county rangers," who would be deputized by
                            county sheriffs for the sole purpose of protecting banksâ€¦ .80

                    the same time, the organization announced its plans to start a lobbying campaign to tighten the laws
                    against bank robbery. Like

                        Iowa
                     bank vigilantes as an inspiration.81 By May, 100 of 
                        Illinois
                    ' 102 counties had organized town guards (the two laggards were to be organized
                    within two weeks), and the state group had furnished vigilantes with guns, ammunition, holsters, and
                    National Rifle Association memberships, at a cost of $250,000.82 By
                    1933, 
                        Illinois
                    , Indiana, 
                        Iowa

                        Kansas
                     had organized vigilance committees in 50 to 90 percent of their counties.83
            
            There were some attempts at cooperation among the various statelevel associations. In October 1930,
                    the bankers' associations of 
                        Illinois
                    , Indiana, 
                  Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, 
                            
                                Minnesota
                            
                        , Nebraska
               , North andSouth Dakota,
                    and 
                        Wisconsin
                     began to coordinate some activities through the Interstate Bank Insurance and
                    Protective Committee. All of the states involved had vigilante organizations; all faced a severe
                    crime problem; and all had seen steep increases in their insurance rates that year. Representatives
                    of the different state organizations proposed harmonizing bank robbery laws, setting up rewards for
                    convictions of criminals engaged in bank crimes, establishing statewide police radio broadcasts,
                    improving federal, state, and local fingerprinting bureaus, beginning training programs for local
                    law enforcement officials and vigilantes, and lobbying for higher salaries for police officers and
                    sheriffs. Committee members also discussed whether to lobby for bills that would legalize killing
                    criminals who were caught in the act of robbing banks.84 Besides these loose
                    bonds, and others such as the American Bank Association's protective department, however,
                    anti-crime efforts were largely a state-level affair.
            VIGILANTISM AND ITS DISCONTENTS
            Not all bankers participated in or supported vigilantism. An editorial in the September 1927 Hoosier Banker reproved 
                        Marion County
                     for its lack of a vigilance committee, calling it the cause of two daylight robberies
                    in the county one month earlier. "Repeatedly has the office of the

                             was "materially smaller."

                     Indiana Bankers Association warned, urged, and entreated its
                    member banks" to take steps to protect themselves, the magazine's editorial writer
                    admonished. The county's unpreparedness was encouraging "other gangs who may
                    decide to start out on a bank campaign." Many bankers failed to take even passive measures.
                    In late 1931, the Hoosier Banker reprinted an article from the 
                        Arkansas
                    
                    Banker beseeching bankers to protect themselves: 
                        Is it not the right time to ask bankers whether they cannot do something to protect
                            themselves and their employees and communities against holdups, and the killing and maiming
                            that follows the average attack? Bandits can bring guns and gas and they can surprise
                            everyone in the bank, and therefore the usual practice now is to let them take what they
                            want and collect the insurance.85
                  
                     A year earlier, the superintendent of Indiana's Bureau of Criminal Identification
                    and Investigation had related to the magazine that one victim of a bank robbery had told him,
                    " T have been paid my insurance money and I am not out a cent, and I don't believe
                    in sending this young man to the penitentiary for from ten years to life.' "86 Two years later, an article hinted that many bankers' ideas had not
                    changed: " â€˜With insuranceâ€¦ protection seems more economical than
                    modern mechanical equipment or strict adherence to preventive measuresâ€¦ the protective
                    program in thousands of banks is limited to indemnity, rather than prevention of loss.â€™
                        "87
            
            To counter such attitudes, bankers' magazines and the mainstream print media argued that
                    vigilantism was necessary. The clear corollary was that those who refused to take part were leaving
                    themselves and their fellow citizens in jeopardy. The Hoosier Banker's
                    editorial writer (probably McDaniel) told readers that "WE MUST HAVE THE COOPERATION OF OUR
                    BANKS" in "TAKING EVERY POSSIBLE PRECAUTION AGAINST THE SUCCESSFUL PERPETRATION OF
                    ANOTHER HOLD-UP."88 The

                     adopt vigilante organizations, asserting that
                    "vigilante associations have proved to be one of the most effective means ever devised with
                    which to combat crime in sparsely settled regionsâ€¦ . It is a primitive method of
                    enforcing the law, but conditions being what they are today, it is justified."89 All writers agreed that vigilantism was a necessity, not a choice, and that
                    it would be better for the government to take over the role if possible. A passage from the

                        [Bankers] felt forced, as a matter of self-protection, to organize their employees as a
                            private defense force, to give instruction in marksmanship and to organize for the pursuit,
                            apprehension, and prosecution of bank bandits. It is noteworthy that nearly all the bank
                            bandit gangs operating outside the larger cities in Indiana during the last ten years have
                            been broken up by private organizations employed by the bankers. Public peace officers have
                            failed to protect towns and smaller cities from the depredations of roving gangs.90
                  
                     In 1925, an editorial in the 
                        Chicago
                    
                    Daily Tribune deplored the state of American society: "America once more
                    is on the frontier. On the frontier there is no law. Insteadâ€¦ the law is a primitive
                    thing left to vigilantes and six shootersâ€¦ . The ordinary course of law enforcement has
                    broken down."91 The next year, a Tribune editorial
                    praised the organization of a vigilante group in 
                        Wisconsin
                     but warned that such a group, although justified by circumstances, was nonetheless a
                    disturbing sign: "It ought not to be necessary in a civilized community for any citizen or
                    group of citizens to arm for the protection of life or property. That is the business, the very
                    first business, of civil government."92 Indiana's state crime

                        "About a month ago, there was a bank robbed in Indiana. The citizens got out in a
                            posse and started after those bank robbers and chased them for quite a while. There was a
                            man in that bunchâ€¦ who was carrying a 30-30 rifle, and he said, â€˜Well,
                            I have chased those fellows about as far as I am going to chase them.â€™ This man
                            was rather an elderly man, and he up with his rifle and with the first crack one of those
                            bandits dropped, and his partner gave himself up. Now, that is the way things ought to be
                                done."93
                  
                    
            
            Complicating the debate was the fact that some criminals achieved not just notoriety but a measure of
                    fame that one historian refers to as "Dillinger mania."94
                    Fascination with criminals and criminality was hardly new; as Eric Hobsbawm writes, bandits have
                    often been considered "fighters for justice, perhaps even leaders of liberation,"
                    and he notes that although modern criminals are rarely seen as admirable, bank robbers in the 1930s
                    in the 
                        United States
                    , such as Bonnie and Clyde, were "historical throwbacks."95 Interestingly, Hobsbawm also observes that the "ideal situation for
                    robbery is one in which the local authorities are local men â€¦ and where a few miles may
                    put the robber beyond the reach or even the knowledge of one set of authorities and into the
                    territory of another, which does not worry about what happens
                    â€˜abroadâ€™"-a perfect description of Indiana's parochial law
                    enforcement structure in the 1920s and early 1930s.96
            
            The fact that, for a time, bank robbers could become admirable figures also reveals something about
                    public attitudes towards the bandits' targets. In a time of economic depression, such as
                    the 1920s in the rural Midwest, bankers were hardly popular figures; not only did they inspire envy
                    because of their association with money, but they were also the agents of the financial system
                    responsible for such tasks as foreclosing on family farms. Bank robbers struck at an institution
                    that drew mixed feelings, at best, from the general public. And if most of those who were

                     directly affected by bank robberies or other violent crimes
                    detested the bandits, others could entertain a sort of admiration for them; as Hobsbawm writes,
                    bandits "are heroes not in spite of the fear and horror their actions inspire, but in some
                    ways because of them. They are not so much men who right wrongs, but avengers, and exerters of
                    power; their appeal is not that of the agents of justice, but of men who prove that even the poor
                    and weak can be terrible."97 The appeal of Dillinger and other 1930s
                    bank criminals suggests the lingering power of the idea of banditry.
            It is also interesting to speculate as to whether that myth of banditry allowed the vigilantes to see
                    themselves as mythic figures. The public comments of the vigilantes and their supporters did not
                    seem to reflect the idea that vigilantism was "an act of public spirit" that was
                    performed selflessly. Yet vigilantes, bankers, and media supporters alike appeared to share the
                    conceit that vigilantism was at once a burden and an opportunity to settle a serious problem in a
                    relatively simple and direct way. Public opinion about the causes of the crime wave of the 1920s and
                    1930s appears to have been equally straightforward, allowing vigilantes to portray themselves as
                    heroes confronting thugs and to condemn those who did not take up arms. As vigilantes, common men
                    and women could also be "exerters of power"; even more appealingly, their
                    exertions enjoyed the sanction of local law enforcement and the social elite.
            Noticeably absent from the rhetoric of bankers, vigilantes, police, and sheriffs alike were
                    considerations of rights and due process, which take center stage in criminal justice debates today.
                    These issues were of minor, and in most cases no, importance, even to professional lawmen of the
                    time. As one Buffalo police official told a reporter, " â€˜My oath of office
                    requires me to protect this community. If I have to violate that oath of office or violate the
                    Constitution, I'll violate the Constitution.â€™ "98
                    Both law enforcement officials and the general public subscribed to a paradigm which Herbert Packer
                    termed the Crime Control Model, which held that the criminal justice system

                        must produce a high rate of apprehension and conviction and must do so in a context where the
                            magnitudes being dealt with are very large, and the resources for dealing with them are very
                            limited. There must then be a premium on speed and finality. Speed, in turn, depends on
                            informality and on uniformity; finality depends on minimizing the occasions for challenge.
                            The process must not be cluttered with ceremonious rituals that do not advance the progress
                            of a case. Facts can be established more quickly through interrogation in a police station
                            than through the formal process of examination and cross-examination in a court; it follows
                            that extrajudicial processes should be preferred to judicial processes, informal to formal
                                operations.99
                  
                     Such a system presumes that a suspect, once apprehended, is guilty. The premises of this
                    model mirror the Regulators' justifications of their actions and the media's
                    praise of the bank vigilantes. Today, Packer argues, far more people subscribe to the Due Process
                    Model, which postulates that the presumption of innocence is more than just a formality in the
                    investigation and prosecution of suspected criminals. In other words, what would today seem to be
                    the natural grounds for opposing vigilantism were not a major factor in the debate of the 1920s and
                    1930s; those who did not join a vigilante group out of principle were probably not acting out of
                    concern about possible violations of criminals' rights.
            If there was no broad public outpouring of support for the vigilantes (and the size of the
                    committees' membership, although numbering in the thousands in each of several states,
                    including Indiana, was not massive), there was also no broad public rejection of their goals or
                    means, which suggests that the vast bulk of the public acquiesced in the vigilantes'
                    activities. That is significant. Although willing to tolerate the exercise of extralegal violence
                    when sanctioned by the state, Americans displayed a "sudden preoccupation with the
                    distinction between legitimate and illegitimate political coercion" during and after World
                    War I, laying the groundwork for what historian Christopher Capozzola terms "the legal and
                    political dismantling of vigilantism in the twentieth century." Thus,

                    illegitimate." Capozzola argues that the official encouragement of vigilant societies
                    during the war, when "ideas, behaviors, labor, and leisure had to be mobilized, regulated,
                    and governed in order to defeat the enemy," transformed a hitherto wholly private tradition
                    into a state project, tying "private coercions to state interests."100 The hand-in-glove association

                     between the bank vigilantes and local officials was not only
                    the result of the same community-based democratic sanctioning that the Regulators had relied upon
                    (formalized through the blessing of the community's democratically elected local
                    law-enforcement agents) and of the impulse toward the maintenance of order that had long
                    characterized vigilance committees, but a method through which the administrative apparatus of the
                    state could cooperate with a politically and economically powerful group (albeit one whose aims were
                    less objectionable than those of, say, Pinkertons in the service of industrialists).
            In 1933, newly inaugurated Governor Paul V. McNutt, with neartotal control of the General Assembly,
                    secured the creation of the Indiana State Police. As a result, by 1934 the bank vigilante movement
                    was nearly at an end. The IBA turned its attention toward raising $100,000 to support the
                    construction of a state police radio network, which the association said would dramatically increase
                    the force's ability to coordinate their efforts.101 After the police
                    radio's completion in the summer of 1936, the Hoosier Banker announced a
                    twenty-percent decrease in bank insurance rates.102 Demonstrating the rapidity
                    and thoroughness of the bankers' relinquishment of force, the Hoosier
                    Banker that year exhorted readers to fight bank crime by cooperating fully with the state
                    police. The article assumed that the robber would be armed and the banker would not be, and
                    explicitly warned readers that although "most banks have revolvers, alarms, tear gas and
                    other subterfuges," it was "seldom advisable to try to use a weapon."
                    Instead, bankers being robbed should "observe, observe, and
                    OBSERVE" so that they could pass along details to the state police as soon as possible.103
            
            Within a few years, Indiana's political culture shifted from sanctioning the private
                    apprehension and even the informal execution of criminals (albeit under minimal government
                    supervision) to using a public and bureaucratic approach to fight crime. The change reflected a
                    broader evolution of popular political beliefs. The nineteenth-century idea of a privileged
                    democratic and legal status for vigilantes, who often operated without the oversight of local or
                    state government, had given

                  A 1933 advertisement in The Hoosier Banker By the early 1930s, many
                            companies were offering locking equipment and alarm systems that, in combination with an
                            improved state police force, would replace the vigilante program. The Hoosier

                     way to the assumption that vigilantes needed the approval of
                    the local authorities. That idea was, in turn, replaced by a belief in the priority of the state
                    government over local institutions. These changes suggest that Indiana's police reforms
                    were not simply a technical reform of a police force that had become obsolete and was widely
                    recognized as such. The creation of the State Police redressed some of Indiana law
                    enforcement's structural deficiencies, but there were more factors at work. The new balance
                    struck between local groups (both the targets of crime, and the politicians and others who had a
                    vested interest in the old system) and the state should be viewed as the negotiation of a new social
                    contract between citizens, communities, and the state government. That the new professional
                    law-enforcement regime the State Police represented was only superimposed on the existing obsolete
                    structure is a testament to the enduring power of parochial interests in Indiana's
                    political system.
            Technological and economic changes undoubtedly contributed to the new compact: it was far more
                    difficult to train, equip, and coordinate thousands of vigilantes across an entire state than it had
                    been for nineteenth-century citizens to organize against a handful of criminals. Combating modern
                    criminal organizations required a professional force that could only be funded and managed by state
                    government. And as the burden of ensuring order increased, so too did the incentives for individuals
                    not to contribute to the provision of this public good; why, after all, should someone voluntarily
                    pay for something that would otherwise have cost him nothing? (Such free-riding problems are major
                    challenges for private law-enforcement mechanisms.)104 For the purposes of this
                    essay, however, the essential point is that these changes followed the creation of a new political
                    reality in which, for practical purposes, the entire citizenry agreed that private agents'
                    freedom to use violence for aims that they defined as public goods would henceforth be dramatically
                    curtailed. In Weberian terms, a traditional justification for the legitimate use of force finally
                    yielded to a wholly legal one, in which force was only "exercised by the modern
                    'servant of the state."105 The vigilantes did not

                     lay down their arms because they had been discredited, but
                    because both they and their sponsors believed that they had been superseded. The Crime Control
                    model, under which both the vigilantes and the professional police operated, continued to dominate
                    thinking about the criminal justice system for decades (and, some would argue, has dominated public
                    discussions about the system down to the present day). The vigilantes may have suspended their
                    operations, but the values they represented are probably still at large.

            PEGGY SEIGEL
            At noon on August 28, 1920, in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , Indiana, and across the nation, the world seemed to come to a standstill. For ten
                    minutes every church bell and factory whistle broadcast the revolutionary change that had finally
                    come to American women. The previous January, Indiana had become the twenty-sixth state to ratify
                    the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, and after a painfully close vote in 
                        Tennessee
                    , the required three-fourths approval had just been achieved. After more than seventy
                    years of struggle, women could finally vote at all levels of government. Suffrage, once a hopeless
                    cause, now enjoyed majority support. It was a time for celebration, confidence, and new beginnings.
            The story of Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women's long journey to fuller citizenship is a fascinating chapter in
                    regional and national history. In common with general trends, in the nineteenth century the
                    city's women's rights pioneers challenged legal and social barriers that

                     inequality. In the decades bridging the nineteenth and
                    twentieth centuries, women became more concerned with addressing problems in their industrial city
                    than with challenging the structures of patriarchal society. Nevertheless, through female-only clubs
                    they acquired new public roles and greater confidence, necessary building blocks for a future
                    suffrage movement. In the second decade of the twentieth century, energized by the growing state and
                    national support of woman suffrage, club women championed suffrage with passion and commitment.1
            
            As in other communities, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women faced generations of deep resistance. Despite the social changes that came with
                    industrialization and rapid population growth, in the nineteenth century few Hoosiers, indeed few
                    Americans, supported changes in traditional gender roles. Beginning in the decade after the Civil
                    War, however, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women faced a different but equally intractable opposition. Fearing that women would
                    use the vote for prohibition, politicians and business leaders representing the city's
                    majority German American population blocked legislative efforts and stifled popular support until
                    the final years leading up to the Nineteenth Amendment. The connection of suffrage to temperance, a
                    relationship that in other states brought women into the political process, was highly detrimental
                    to the growth of the suffrage movement in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    . With few allies in the male power establishment, the city's women were
                    latecomers to the political campaign for suffrage.
            A QUEST DEFERRED: 1851-1880
            Historian Blanche Glassman Hersh's analysis of nineteenth-century feminist abolitionists
                    provides a helpful insight for understanding Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's pioneer suffragists. Through their work for the liberation of slaves, Hersh
                    writes, feminist leaders including Abby Kelly, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and
                    Lucretia Mott became conscious of their own gender limitations. Beginning in the 1840s they called
                    on women to pursue meaningful activities and, above all, to assert their right to determine their
                    own lives. The goals of the pioneer feminist abolitionists were to liberate people both in their
                    social interactions and in 
                  
                     1 Historians generally agree on three stages of the suffrage movement.
                            See, for example, Stephen M. Buechler, The Transformation of the Woman Suffrage

                     their family settings. These deeply religious women believed
                    that society needed their "moral and spiritual influence."2
            
            Feminist abolitionists organized the first national women's rights meeting at Seneca Falls, 
                        New York
                    , in July 1848. In the following decade, informal coordinating committees organized
                    annual national conventions that were largely publicized in antislavery newspapers. On the state
                    level, women's rights leaders formed associations in 
                  New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts
               , and farther west in 
                        Ohio
                     and Indiana. At both the national and state levels, these pioneers championed broad
                    political, social, and economic changes for women, including the right to vote. Prior to the Civil
                    War, however, these groups met irregularly and often remained informally organized.3

                        Wayne
                    's earliest suffragists were among the converts to this emerging movement. Like
                    their better-known eastern sisters, they were universal reformers who championed the major reform
                    causes of the mid-nineteenth century-abolition of slavery, temperance, and women's rights.
                    Many had grown up in the leading antislavery centers of the Midwest nurtured by 
                        Quaker
                     feminism, Utopian beliefs, and a common sense of woman's mission.4 In October 1851, only three years after the Seneca Falls meeting, pioneer
                    reformers organized the Indiana Women's Rights Association (WRA) in 
                  Dublin, Wayne County
               ,
                    and adopted the ideology and goals of the earlier convention. Resolutions affirmed that
                    "all customs, laws and institutions" should afford men and women equal
                    "social and mental improvement"; that men and women should share equal
                    responsibilities "for creating and administering the social, civil and religious
                    institutions under which they are to live"; and that women should free themselves from
                    "the domestic, social, pecuniary, educational, religious and political
                    disabilities" that oppressed them. Reformers also pledged to "throw off the
                    bondage" of current fashions and "adopt a style of dress more in accordance with
                        reason."5

                        Wayne
                     area had issued the call for the historic meeting and were among the 170 founding
                    members of the Indiana WRA. Several women were charged with forming a local organization in their
                    rural Aboite Township neighborhood, but no evidence suggests that such an organization existed
                    before the Civil War. Two leaders in particular, Mary Frame Thomas and Beulah Puckett Ninde,
                    nevertheless brought the issue of women's equality to public attention.6
            
            Unable to attend the first WRA meeting, Mary Thomas wrote to the participants expressing her hopes
                    for the new movement. "The elevation of Woman to the position of equal privileges with Man
                    socially, religiously, civilly, and educationally," she insisted, was "essential
                    to the happiness and progression of the race." Thomas was likely also the author of two
                    forceful letters signed "Eliza," published in the Fort 
                            Wayne
                         Times in December 1851. The writer argued that those who assign
                    "woman certain prescribed limits, as her sphere of action," who believe that her
                    intelligence is less than man's, and who limit her to being a social ornament, express
                    views held by "savages, the uncultivated, and untutoredâ€¦ . The doctrine of
                    female imbecility is without foundation." The following week a correspondent identified as "
                        Orlando
                    " countered with the conventional view that women should be
                    "unentangled with the intricacies of political government, and shielded from its
                    contaminating influence; well educated; and fully qualified for adorning society."
                    Furthermore, "
                        Orlando
                    " insisted, "[n]early all agree that they [women] are now in the full
                    enjoyment of all their legitimate rights." In reply, "Eliza" again
                    stressed the fundamental injustices of woman's position in American society: "Men
                    may boast of their republican and happy institutions, but in respect to women they are oppressive
                    and unjust.

                            of the Indiana WRA. Beulah Puckett Ninde (1826-1892) signed the official list of charter
                            members. Charged with organizing meetings in their township were Mary Thomas, her husband

            Thomas's commitment to establishing a career as a physician, however, delayed her
                    involvement in women's rights organizations. Soon after moving to rural Aboite Township in
                    1850, she began medical study under her husband Owen. In the spring of 1854 Mary and Owen opened a
                    joint medical practice in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , with Mary specializing in the treatment of women and children. Intermittently, she
                    studied at Western Reserve College in 
                        Cleveland
                     and Penn Medical University in 
                        Philadelphia
                    . Following graduation from Penn in 1856, Mary Thomas and her family moved to 
                        Richmond
                    , Indiana, seeking a community more supportive of female physicians. The next year,
                    Thomas accepted the presidency of the Indiana WRA, a position she held for many years.8
            
            By nature, Beulah Ninde seemed less inclined than Mary Thomas to take on a public voice, making her
                    participation harder to trace. In addition, health concerns-the loss of twins in childbirth in 1852
                    and a pregnancy in the spring of 1854-likely delayed her participation in reform activities.
                    Nevertheless, in the decade before the Civil War, Ninde maintained ties to the Indiana WRA, serving
                    as an officer in 1856 and 1857, and remained active in temperance reform.
            Ninde became known as a leader in the Ladies' Temperance Alliance, formed in the spring of
                    1854 as an auxiliary to the all-male 
                        Allen County
                     Liquor Law Alliance. Such an organization represented a new assertiveness, as Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women exercised their right to support legislation then pending before the state
                    General Assembly. The group published its constitution in the local newspaper, openly declaring its
                    moral concerns. Pseudonymous letters published in local newspapers (and probably written by Beulah
                    or her husband Lindley) also voiced support for woman's right to enter the public sphere.

                    city" and thus should have the right to vote: "It is to be hoped that the time
                    will soon come, when false notions of propriety shall no longer restrain [woman's] voice
                    from being heard through the ballot box," the writer argued. "In behalf of the
                    cause of temperance no one has a greater right to speak than woman. She in fact is the sufferer. The
                    evil concentrates on her." Resisting controversial tactics used by Winchester, Indiana,
                    women in the so-called "Whiskey Riot" during the summer of 1854, Ninde and other
                    local temperance reformers employed traditional female strategies of writing letters, circulating
                    tracts, and boycotting merchants who sold alcohol.9
            
            As temperance initiatives met stiff resistance, men and women together organized Grand Templar
                    lodges. Pledging to elevate "the moral sentiment of this community and the world,"
                    they also promised to cure those afflicted with alcoholism and help their families. What was new to

                        Wayne
                     in both the organization and governance of these lodges was the unusual degree to which
                    men and women shared leadership responsibilities. Within a few months of its founding in late 1859,
                    for example, the 
                        Washington
                     Lodge grew to eighty members. Four of its nine officers were women; Beulah Ninde was
                    named the first vice-president. A second local temperance organization, the Total Abstinence Lodge,
                    listed fifteen officers, eight of whom were women.10

                        one of the leaders of the Winchester "Whiskey Riot." Temperance women in
                        Winchester, Indiana, had demanded that merchants pledge to not sell liquor. When this tactic was
                        unsuccessful, a group of women broke open and emptied kegs of alcohol. Arrested and tried in

                        rapidly across Indiana and other midwestern states. The organization appealed to
                        women's rights leaders because women were recognized as equals in the group's
                        structure. Amanda Way was elected to the highest offices in Indiana's antebellum

            While feminists found an avenue for promoting women's rights in temperance reform, the
                    separate women's rights movement remained highly controversial. Annual meetings of the
                    Indiana WRA occasionally drew large audiences and prominent national speakers, but on the eve of the
                    Civil War, there was little local support. This became particularly evident in January 1859, when
                    Thomas and two other women presented a petition to the Indiana General Assembly calling for equal
                    property rights for married women and for suffrage. Disregarding the signatures of more than one
                    thousand Indiana men and women, a Fort 
                        Wayne
                     newspaper expressed outrage over the initiative, undertaken by "three crazy
                    women" whose husbands, for tolerating such "he-male" action, were
                    "surely under petticoat government."11
            
            Once the Civil War began, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women took on a variety of public responsibilities to meet wartime demands. Working
                    through soldiers' aid societies, women organized fundraisers, made and collected badly
                    needed supplies, and cared for sick and impoverished families of soldiers. Facing financial
                    hardships, many women took on roles as family provider. The crucial need for medical care in
                    military hospitals and camps also opened new opportunities for women nurses.12
            
            After the war, Beulah and Lindley Ninde renewed efforts to build a women's rights movement
                    in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    . With Thomas and some twenty others, the Nindes called a statewide meeting in 
                        Indianapolis
                     in June 1869. In March 1871, the Nindes and other local supporters organized an

                     Woman Suffrage Association, was a lawyer and journalist, and had been a key organizer

                        Illinois
                     woman suffrage conventions in 1868. Her husband, Charles B. Waite, a prominent 
                        Chicago
                     attorney and judge, was another founder of the

                     Suffrage Association, and had successfully lobbied the 
                        Illinois
                     Legislature in 1869 for the right of women to their own earnings. Adelle Hazlett of
                    Hillsdale, 
                        Michigan
                    , the president of the recently  organized North
                    Western Woman Suffrage Association, was praised as being "as sharp as a steel
                    trap" and able to keep "her audience spellbound by her eloquence."14
            
            For two days, speakers supported resolutions affirming the right of married women to make contracts,
                    own property, and control their own earnings. Echoing arguments made twenty years earlier,
                    women's rights supporters affirmed that enlarging woman's sphere of influence
                    would serve "the true interests of the Government, the Church, and the Family."
                    They saw suffrage as a means to correct "all the wrongs women now suffer as a
                    class."
            Claiming the expertise of twenty years of legal practice, Lindley Ninde called woman's
                    current legal status "unnatural" and the principal of unequal treatment
                    "at variance with every demand of morality and justice." Catharine Waite and
                    Hazlett stressed the need for equal opportunities for women, including the means to support
                    themselves, at the same time acknowledging woman's traditional domestic role.

                    have a republic in fact as well as in deed," Waite said. The greatest curse of our nation
                    was "the aristocracy of sex." Assuring her audience that voting would not
                    interfere with women's duties at home, she stressed the urgency of national housekeeping,
                    which "will never be properly performed until there is a more complete blending of the
                    duties and influence of men and women."15
            
            On the second day, the convention elected officers and drew up a constitution for an 
                        Allen County
                     suffrage association. Not surprisingly, Beulah Ninde was chosen president. Most of the
                    officers were women, but Robert McNiece, associate editor of the Daily Gazette,
                    and Lindley Ninde, were appointed as well.
            The leaders had anticipated deep resistance, for as Hazlett expressed in her opening remarks, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     frequently gave the impression of being "too much asleep to a question of such

                                 Daily Gazette, March 16, 17, 1871. There is no direct reference to
                            temperance in the newspaper account, but it is likely that local activist Junia Aveline
                            spoke about the importance of suffrage for temperance reform: "Mrs. Aveline made a
                            short address decidedly practical, and those who have passed through the trials and
                            oppressions that were there portrayed, can not consistently withhold their support from this
                            question."
               
                     as that of Woman Suffrage." Attendance, however,
                    remained "very large notwithstanding the rainy weather." Seventy people signed the
                    charter as members. The Daily Gazette optimistically concluded that
                    "[t]he convention, as a whole, has been a decided success." Yet in the next
                    day's newspaper, McNiece also stressed the deep community resistance.
                    "[Established custom is a hard thing to fight," he wrote. "The error has
                    to be hammered into the ears of the people a long time before they can comprehend it."16
            
            Two years later, in February 1873, three of the most dynamic women of the day lectured to Fort 
                        Wayne
                     audiences, generating interest, if not support, for the fledgling suffrage movement.
                    Speaking before packed auditoriums, Mary Livermore, Anna Dickenson, and Susan B. Anthony charmed
                    their audiences with addresses described as "fascinating," very
                    instructive," "brave and truthful." In a speech that she would deliver
                    hundreds of times-"What Shall We Do With Our Daughters?"-Livermore urged girls to
                    be self-reliant, healthy, and welleducated. Provoking frequent applause, Dickenson bluntly urged
                    women to strive for greatness and not to settle for low-paying jobs. "Let women undergo the
                    same training and she will fare the same as men," she said. Anthony gave "a
                    compact legal and constitutional argument for voting in the recent presidential election which would
                    have done credit to the best lawyers in the city." The speakers' challenges
                    apparently provoked little public debate.17
            
            During the same weeks in 1873, opposition to temperance surfaced as never before, revealing the
                    growing city's deep German American roots. Temperance supporters had recently scored a
                    statewide victory with the General Assembly's passage of the Baxter Bill, which closed down
                    local unlicensed saloons (estimated to number well over 200 in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    ) and made saloon owners liable for damages inflicted by their drunken patrons. German
                    Americans, now comprising more than one-fourth of the city's population, hailed John
                    Sarnighausen, state senator from 
                        Allen County
                    , as a hero for opposing the new law, and struck a general posture of defiance.18

                         in 1862, Sarnighausen became editor and part owner of the Stoats Zeitung. He worked

                        , Sarnighausen was a leader of local German American opposition to the temperance
                        movement. Illustrated Historical Atlas of the State of Indiana (

            In the spring of 1874, the association of many local temperance leaders with the suffrage movement
                    dealt a huge blow to the latter's public viability. The week before the annual meeting of
                    the Indiana WRA, the Fort 
                        Wayne
                     Ladies' Union led a conference of northern Indiana temperance supporters at
                    First Presbyterian Church. Official business included selection of delegates, both women and men, to
                    attend the upcoming statewide convention in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Attendees were also 
                  minister, and from 1873 to 1879 was elected to four terms in the Indiana Senate. Rebecca

                     enthusiastically invited by Rev. Abijah Marine, pastor of Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's Berry Street Methodist Church, to attend the woman's suffrage
                    convention the following week in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    .19
            
            Almost simultaneously, however, the German American community charged Marine with having slandered
                    "a certain class of Germans" in a recent out-of-town speech. Mayor Zollinger,
                    Sarnighausen, and other leaders of the German community, as well as over 500 local citizens, called
                    for Marine to appear before "an indignation meeting" to explain himself. Despite
                    efforts to make peace, Marine became the target of heated charges. The local Democratic newspaper,
                    the Sentinel, described him as "a strenuous advocate of the temperance cause, and likewise
                    of woman suffrage." At the "mass meeting," a prominent German American
                    expressed the fear of many of his fellow immigrants, charging that Marine and other temperance
                    supporters wanted "to get woman suffrage and â€˜abolish all foreignersâ€™
                    and possess themselves of their property." The deep and bitter battle between liquor
                    interests and suffragists that would be played out in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     and across the country for another forty years had begun.20
            
            The conflict probably contributed to the somber mood and low attendance that marked the state
                    women's rights meeting at the end of May. Hoping to distance themselves from the temperance
                    issue, attendees voted down resolutions urging women suffrage supporters to back political
                    candidates who were "avowed friends of temperance" and committed to
                    "giving the ballot to women." Newspaper reports instead recorded "strong
                    and sensible" speeches on behalf of woman suffrage delivered by featured speakers.
                    "[W]omen have right and justice on their side [so] that it will be impossible to resist the
                    movement which has been inaugurated," McNiece argued. As she had three years earlier,
                    Hazlett gave "a rousing speech" that stressed the injustice of denying half of the
                    population "the inalienable right of suffrage." Progress was now being made, she
                    said, as shown by the 
                        Michigan
                     legislature's recent vote to submit a revised state constitution, which would
                    allow woman suffrage.
            Few others at the meeting shared the speakers' enthusiasm. Resolutions offered no clear
                    action for gaining suffrage. Soon after the

                     20 Ibid., June 1,2,4, 1874.
               
                     close of the convention, a carefully argued appeal for woman
                    suffrage, "The Unfairness of its Opponents," appeared in the Fort 
                            Wayne
                         News. The local Democratic newspaper, the Weekly Sentinel,
                    quickly smothered hope for rational dialogue. "That woman will give her support to the
                    temperance cause cannot for a moment be doubted, but it will be such misdirected and wrong headed
                    support as will tend to promote and expand the very evil which is to be removed."
                    Furthermore, the Sentinel's editor charged, "The strongest
                    argument against woman suffrage â€¦ is that woman is not possessed of good
                    judgement." Referring to the moral zeal of temperance crusaders, the Sentinel further
                    criticized the "tendency among the ladies of the woman suffrage reform to square everything
                    by the rule of moral equity." For the time being, popular opinion in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     likely confirmed the editor's opinion that "both sexes [were] for the
                    most part entirely indifferent to the whole question."21
            
            Another underlying, often unstated, objection to woman suffrage was the expectation that
                    woman's place was in the home and that this would be undermined by the goals of the
                    woman's rights movement. On the national level this debate was being played out in
                    Anthony's failure to gain backing from labor leaders. Working-class men, threatened by
                    possible competition in the workplace, rejected Anthony's appeals for woman's
                    right to support herself. Furthermore, within German workingclass family traditions, women in
                    particular were sharply defined in terms of family responsibilities. Suffrage and women's
                    rights ran counter to deep social and religious traditions that placed women in a subservient
                    relationship to men.22
            
            Despite its obvious unpopularity, the women's temperance crusade had a small number of local
                    converts who, like antebellum reformers, fervently believed in woman's special mission to
                    reform society and liberate her sisters. Foremost among Fort 
                        Wayne
                     crusaders was Junia Aveline, a woman already known for her work with the local Civil
                    War soldiers' aid society and for her support of suffrage. Like other temperance leaders,
                    Aveline was motivated by the evils of alcohol that affected women and children around her. She had
                    also been deeply affected on a

                    the spring of 1874, Aveline spent seven months speaking from the courthouse steps and throughout the
                    district hoping to arouse her neighbors "to a sense of their country's
                    danger" from alcohol. Mother Eliza Stewart of 
                  Athens, Ohio
               , "the
                    war horse" of the temperance movement, made summer visits to build local support.23
            
            Local supporters formed one of Indiana's first chapters of the WCTU in November 1874. Two
                    months later, on January 22, 1875, Aveline, together with Zeralda Wallace of 
                        Indianapolis
                     (the first president of the Indiana WCTU), and fellow temperance leader Mrs. Robinson,
                    delivered a memorial signed by 10,000 women to the Indiana General Assembly urging temperance
                    reform. The indifference of the legislators convinced Wallace of the necessity of having the vote
                    and propelled her subsequent struggle to build a state suffrage movement. In Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , however, following this historic effort, temperance and suffrage seemed to gain few
                    new supporters.24
            
            Moral reformers nevertheless found other causes that would advance their mission to alleviate social
                    problems in their rapidly growing industrial city. Two initiatives in particular, both begun in the
                    1870s, illustrate the continued tradition of female benevolence and moral reform together with a new
                    unsentimental direction. In both efforts, women found new public and feminist voices.
            In 1873 Beulah Ninde helped organize and manage a Home for the Friendless to care for indigent women,
                    many of whom had fallen into prostitution. While new to Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , efforts to assist such women had their roots in antebellum female benevolence work in
                    larger cities. Caring for over 400 women during the home's ten-year existence, Ninde and
                    other women officers relied on contributions from the city's evangelical churches and from

                    women's rights advocate, who came to the city in April 1878.25
            
            Reaching further into the community, in February 1878 women from a broad cross-section of Protestant
                    churches organized the Ladies' Benevolent Society to identify impoverished families and
                    coordinate efforts of local charities. While their goals reflected a decided concern for alleviating
                    poverty, the women were also determined to exercise efficient administration. For example, as part
                    of their plan of implementation, a board of women visitors was assigned to each ward in the city to
                    seek the "most important information" by means of "personal and careful
                    inquiry." In this effort, Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's female moral reformers resembled advocates of "scientific
                    charity" in other northern cities.26
            
            In thirty years, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     had grown from a small town of 4,000 residents to a rapidly growing city of 27,000
                    people. Women who sought a political voice in suffrage and temperance organizations had been largely
                    silenced by male politicians and community leaders, especially those from the German American
                    community. How many women were deterred from or brought into the women's rights movement by
                    meeting such resistance is impossible to guess. What is certain is that an increasing number of
                    local women were taking on new public roles. Refusing to be silenced, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women were gaining valuable experiences and building feminist networks that would serve
                    them well in the future.27

            RETREAT AND NEW DIRECTIONS: 1880-1910
            During the next thirty years, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     continued to shed its small-town status, more than doubling its population and running
                    a close race with 
                        South Bend
                     to be Indiana's second-largest industrial center. Unlike the immigrants who
                    swelled other urban centers, however, those moving to Fort 
                        Wayne
                     followed local ethnic patterns already well established by the mid-nineteenth century.
                    Comparatively few Eastern and Southern Europeans or African Americans moved to the city to work in
                    the factories and railroad yards. At the turn of the century, twothirds of city residents shared a
                    common German ancestry.28
            
            German Americans owned many of the city's leading businesses, and dominated local politics
                    and culture. In 1896, for example, Germans and German Americans held all but two of the
                    city's nineteen top government positions, including the office of mayor. German American
                    athletic and musical societies and two German-language newspapers conspicuously influenced the
                    city's social and cultural life. One society, the Bruederlicher Unterstuetzungs Verein,
                    described as "one of the strongest German organizations in the world," reported a
                    local membership of "more than 1,000" in 1911. Competitions among German American
                    societies throughout the Midwest brought thousands of German Americans to Fort 
                        Wayne
                     for popular festivals. In June 1902, the fifth annual Saengerfest (competitive singing
                    festival) for male choirs drew over three thousand singers and guests from Indiana and 
                        Ohio
                     for a two-day event in Centlivre Park. In June 1909, the Indiana Saengerfest brought
                    thousands of visitors to a grand concert at the Majestic Theatre, followed the next day by an
                    all-day picnic at Robinson Park. In 1901 and 1911, the Fort 
                        Wayne
                     Turnverein-Voerwaerts athletic society sponsored gymnastic tournaments that also
                    featured parades and band concerts. The 1911 program included a welcoming ceremony on the courthouse
                    square, with a performance by eight hundred Fort

                     women who were active in the suffrage and temperance movements shared their
                    city's German heritage. Faced with intense community opposition, they retreated from the
                    broad challenge to organize a women's rights movement. While 
                        Indianapolis
                     women were throwing their efforts behind the newly organized Equal Suffrage Society and

                        Wayne
                     women, with few exceptions, avoided the issue of suffrage altogether. Moreover, in
                    contrast to patterns across Indiana and the nation, few Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women participated in the WCTU, the largest female organization of its day.
                    Nevertheless, by the turn of the century, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women were steadily, if circuitously, building networks that would lead to greater
                    political engagement.30
            
            In 1881 woman suffrage advocates, now prominently associated with temperance, gained strong support
                    in the Indiana General Assembly. Due to their efforts, as well as memorials and petitions from
                    thousands of women, the General Assembly passed bills to allow women to vote for presidential
                    electors and to amend the state constitution so that women could vote in all elections. Zeralda
                    Wallace, Mary F. Thomas, and Helen Gougar of 
                        Lafayette
                     campaigned vigorously across the state, hoping women would help elect Republican
                    representatives to the 1883 legislature. In accordance with Indiana law, constitutional changes
                    required approval by two consecutive assemblies and then a popular vote.
            Unfortunately for the cause of suffrage, the 1881 General Assembly had also passed an amendment in
                    favor of a far less popular cause: prohibition. Women from twenty-nine counties had sent memorials
                    and petitions in support of the amendment, but

                    reorganized by representatives of Protestant churches led by Susan Creighton Williams. Political
                    involvement in the 1883 election was not recorded. In the following years, newspaper notices
                    reported only occasional WCTU meetings, and those avoided political engagement. For example, in
                    October 1885 the WCTU invited the public to prayer services at the temperance headquarters. If
                    suffrage and temperance were not completely dormant issues, they were, as historian Stephen Buechler
                    observed, clearly in "a state of drift and uncertainty."32
            
            For two days in November 1887, however, state and national leaders temporarily awakened the sleeping
                    reform spirit. Audiences packed the Berry Street Methodist Episcopal Church to hear Wallace and May
                    Wright Sewall, both representing the recently formed 
                        Indianapolis
                     auxiliary to the National Woman Suffrage Association, as well as Gougar and the
                    indefatigable Susan B. Anthony. Recognizing the lack of progress on the state level, these leaders
                    were visiting each Indiana congressional district to generate support for the sixteenth amendment to
                    the Constitution during the next session of Congress. Simultaneously, the women stressed the
                    importance of electing supportive legislators to the next Indiana Assembly.33
            
            The speakers' eloquence, "forcible manner," and personal charm impressed
                    their Fort 
                        Wayne
                     audiences. Wallace spoke bluntly, advocating the importance of woman's vote
                    for total prohibition: " â€˜I am not for local option or high
                    license,â€™" she proclaimed. â€˜"I am for prohibition from the
                    crown of my head to the sole of my feet,â€™ and when the ballot is placed in 
                  
                     32 Aveline's death in July 1880 no doubt contributed to the
                            decline of the local WCTU chapter. Fort

                     women's hands the American saloon, with all its evils
                    and ruinous influences will have to go." Wallace also evoked the nativism and elitism
                    common among many women's rights leaders, arguing that women were "more deserving
                    of and better qualified to exercise the right of suffrage than the negro and the thousands of
                    ignorant voters in whose hands it was now placed." Given Anthony's reservations
                    about linking suffrage with temperance, she not surprisingly delivered only a "brief
                    talk," nevertheless impressing her audience with her "clear and powerful voice,
                    which makes her language impressive and her arguments real." Officers elected to serve the
                    newly organized twelfth district suffrage association once again included pioneer leader Beulah
                    Ninde as president.34
            
            Suffrage and temperance soon faded again from the public forum. Clearly, the description of the 1880s
                    as the "doldrums" in suffrage history applied to Fort 
                        Wayne
                    . The first generation of impassioned moral reformers was dying. Beginning in the 1890s,
                    however, newly formed women's clubs began to bring women into dynamic new female networks.
                    Concurrently, small but significant WCTU organizations in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     and surrounding communities kept alive the spirit of reform.35
            
            Steven Buechler argues that the tremendous popularity of the World's Congress of
                    Representative Women at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in 
                        Chicago
                     made suffrage fashionable and attracted upperclass women to the movement. Certainly
                    detailed coverage in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     newspapers stirred pride in women's achievements. Yet other forces-including
                    higher educational levels, more free time, and perhaps above all else, a need for meaningful
                    self-expression-brought women together in a quickly spreading popular phenomena, the
                    woman's club. Not only did clubs provide alternatives to the controversial temperance and
                    suffrage groups; they offered members organizational experience and an emphasis on social
                    responsibility. Historian Karen J. Blair argues that club women were able to maintain their
                    traditional domestic values while pursuing new feminist agendas.36

                            Wayne
                         Woman's Club League was organized in December 1892, two years after the
                        Indiana State Federation of Women's Clubs. The Fort 
                            Wayne
                         federation joined the General Federation of Woman's Clubs in 1897.
            
            
            Events involving the Woman's Club League in the winter and spring of 1898 suggest the
                    gradual progress women were making in the public arena. The league's quarterly meeting in
                    January included, in addition to the accustomed entertainment and socialization, a
                    "scholarly" lecture by former mayor Chauncey Oakley, who stressed women's
                    key role in future politics. "Many branches of municipal power would be improved by having
                    women occupying positions on their boards," he stated, and optimistically predicted that
                    women would soon be serving as city officials. In May, local religious leaders placed women
                    preachers or speakers in "every pulpit but two" in the city to acknowledge the
                    biennial convention of the National Federation of Women's clubs then meeting in 
                        Denver
                    .37
            
            Through their work within the Woman's Club Federation, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women extended their roles as municipal housekeepers. Working through the Civic
                    Department, women cleaned up downtown alleys "for the purpose of demonstrating how the
                    alleys in the city ought to be cleaned." They built playgrounds and established sanitary
                    drinking fountains. Supporting the work of the Civic Improvement Association, they urged all women
                    to learn about efforts underway to beautify their city. Other initiatives included pressuring the
                    police department to enforce a juvenile curfew and hire a police matron, and convincing stores to
                    close early on Saturday evenings. For such projects, the Women's Club League generally
                    appeared to have the approval of the city's male power structure.38
            
            In other cases, local officials showed extreme disregard for women's opinions. In December
                    1909, members of the Women's League wrote to Mayor Jesse Grice, encouraging him to enforce
                    laws and ordinances that were "subject of flagrant violation or neglect." At the
                    top of their list were unenforced child labor and child neglect laws. Three years later, Grice
                    finally replied to the letter, stating that the women's concerns were either unwarrranted
                    or had been corrected.39

                        Wayne
                     club women again challenged the interests of the business establishment and again were
                    silenced. The controversy concerned legislation introduced in the Indiana General Assembly by state
                    labor leaders and the Indiana Federation of Women's Clubs to shorten the work hours of
                    children under sixteen in the state's factories. Fort 
                        Wayne
                     club women were familiar with children's working conditions in the
                    city's factories and supportive of the state federation's position. Two years
                    earlier, in 1909, Mrs. Virgil Lockwood of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , chairman of the department of labor for the state federation, had been invited to Fort 
                        Wayne
                     to give a lecture for the Woman's Club League. During this visit she
                    investigated local factories that employed large numbers of children and stayed with a personal
                    friend, local club woman Mary McCrea Wilson. When legislative hearings began in January 1911, Wilson
                    led the Fort 
                        Wayne
                     Woman's Club League's Industrial Committee in collecting letters and
                    lobbying state politicians to support the child labor bill.
            Sponsors of the bill advocated a forty-eight-hour work week, a proposal that seriously affected Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's largest employer of women and girls, the 
                        Wayne
                     Knitting Mills. Over two thousand of the mill's employees (two-thirds of the
                    workforce) were under sixteen years old, mostly female, and working at low-paying jobs for
                    fifty-five hours a week. At hearings before the Indiana General Assembly in January, company
                    president Theodore F. Thieme, his brother Frederick, and other state industrialists bitterly fought
                    the legislation. Reflecting the businessmen's influence, the child labor bill that finally
                    passed limited the work week to fifty hours, fifty-four with parental permission-a minor victory at
                    best for reformers.40
            
            After the final vote, the Fort 
                        Wayne
                     Woman's Club remained mostly quiet about its previous support for the
                    legislation. They publicly reported their lobbying efforts months later, among numerous other
                    activities of the club. Furthermore, the connection between the final

                     legislation and the intensive pressure brought by executives of
                    the 
                        Wayne
                     Knitting Mills remained unstated.41
            
            Despite deep cultural resistance, the WCTU maintained a small membership in 
                        Allen County
                    . Branches were formed in the towns of Hoagland, Maysville, and Monroeville, as well as
                    in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , with membership drawn from Protestant churches. While stopping far short of the
                    national organization's commitment to "militant feminism, equal rights, and full
                    participation in the political process," local WCTU members, strengthened by their
                    religious convictions, invited conflict. Following recognized patterns, the WCTU spurred political
                    consciousness, if not action, and kept the suffrage spirit alive at a time when momentum was
                    otherwise non-existent.42 At a semi-annual county institute in 1892, for
                    example, members pledged to "never give up the fight until the last saloon" was
                    closed. In January 1911, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     members urged a grand jury to arrest landladies in the city's notorious
                    red-light district. The following June, the group threatened to impeach the mayor for not enforcing
                    laws to close saloons on legal holidays.43
            
            Despite these local efforts, 
                        Allen County
                     WCTU members apparently did little in 1898 and 1899 in response to calls by state
                    leaders to lobby legislators in support of a state constitutional amendment for woman suffrage.
                    While women from twenty-five Indiana counties organized petition drives, 
                        Allen County
                     women remained unengaged and silent. At most, they helped suffrage maintain a
                    grassroots foothold that would contribute to its future acceptance.44 Speaking
                    at a WCTU meeting in May 1903 at

                    voiced arguments of the earliest women's rights pioneers. "I am in favor of it
                    because I know of no reason why it should not be given them," he said. "She has
                    the same interest in public affairs that men have, and she ought to have a voice in the framing and
                    the execution of the laws. She would carry righteousness into politics and would correct many of the
                    evils that now threaten the life of the nation and are doing incalculable harm to the
                    people." At a two-day county institute in 1909, a female speaker voiced similar arguments.
                    Woman suffrage in municipal elections would "secure clean politics, clean homes, pure
                    morals and right living on the part of every man, woman and child in the municipality."
                    "[W]e believe in woman suffrage because it is right and just." Her speech was

            Such efforts stood in courageous opposition to the strong early twentieth-century opponents of
                    temperance on the local and state levels. Fort

                    's eight German societies, like their counterparts across the country, joined
                    finances to support the most powerful political lobby of their day, the National German American
                    Alliance (GAA). Identified by national suffrage leaders as "the allied organization that
                    performed the deadliest work in woman suffrage campaigns," its single purpose was to fight
                    temperance and suffrage on all levels. Working with the GAA was the U. S. Brewer's
                    Association, organized on the state level in 1909.46
            
            The most powerful local suffrage opponent was political boss, industrial leader, and liquor lobbyist
                    Stephen B. Fleming. An officer of the Berghoff Brewing Company, Fleming was elected to six terms as
                    State Senator between 1901 and 1915 and served as president of the Association of Indiana Brewers.
                    As one of the state's leading representatives of the GAA, Fleming enforced the
                    alliance's anti-suffrage policy, adopted in 1911 by its 600,000 members. Fleming had the

            Opposition to temperance and (by association) suffrage occurred on more subtle levels as well. In
                    1910 a group of prominent German Americans, Theodore Thieme of 
                        Wayne
                     Knitting Mills included, partnered with the Berghoff Brewery to create Germania Park as
                    a way to sell beer directly to the public (and on Sunday) in violation of the recent Proctor Laws.
                    Preserving the German culture, beer included, was an undisputed value broadly shared and defended by

                    's German American community.48
            
            By 1911, understandably, local opposition to the WCTU was taking a toll on its members. The local
                    chapter identified only four priorities: Sabbath observance, medical temperance, prohibition of
                    illegal sale of liquor at the 
                        Allen County
                     fair, and open-air meetings. Their 1911-1912 report alleged that during the previous
                    year, their organization had "been generally misunderstood, publicly misrepresented and, in
                    many instances, maligned, and it has taken every degree of loyalty its members possess to continue
                    to plod onward under these circumstances."49
            
            ORGANIZATION AND FINAL VICTORY: 1911-1920
            Despite the lack of support for women's suffrage, the dynamics of change were everywhere
                    evident in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     in the second decade of the new century. Within ten years, the city would edge out 
                        South Bend
                     as Indiana's second most important manufacturing center. Local factories
                    employed the highest percentage of female workers of any city in the state. Scarcely resembling its
                    former self, the city seemed to come of age in 1920, bulging with a population of almost 87,000.

                    repeated efforts by Indiana suffragists and temperance leaders to push legislation through the
                    General Assembly. Nevertheless, valuable experiences in their community through women's
                    clubs and charity work, together with growing support from mainstream churches, guided women into
                    new public roles. Women's issues were now to be taken seriously, even if political and
                    business forces were still largely aligned against suffrage. This time, as suffrage supporters
                    organized and finally gained local support, they began to distance themselves from their WCTU
                    sisters.
            When Myra Strawn Hartshorn, chair of the Cook County Suffrage Committee, spoke to the Fort 
                        Wayne
                     Woman's Club League in February 1911, she charmed her audience with her
                    academic credentials, professional writing experience, and traditional role as "a devoted
                    mother of two babies." Certainly Hartshorn's newspaper photograph with her
                    children added an aura of domesticity to offset any suggestions of militancy. It was the content of
                    her speech, however-"New Educational Methods in Suffrage"-that won ready converts.
                    If women were more aware of the conditions of women sweatshop workers, she told her audience, they
                    would realize the importance of electing political representatives to serve the needs of society.
                    Appealing directly to the Woman's Club membership, Hartshorn also stressed statistics
                    showing women's growing educational achievements: "You can't keep
                    political power out of the hands of the educated class." Finally, the speaker urged Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women to adopt plans used by settlement houses and political wards to study their local
                    and state government and to learn where their elected officials stood on such subjects as wages and
                    working conditions for women. There was no doubting the next morning's newspaper report
                    that "Mrs. Hartshorn's successful lecture" had "stirred up the
                    smoldering interest of club women in suffrage."50
            
            Two weeks later, in a specially called meeting, the Woman's Club organized "a
                    society to study the social and political aspects of suffrage for women." Dr. Carrie Belle
                    Banning, a fifty-four-year-old local physician, was selected as chairman. In the following months, 
                        Chicago

                    , visited the city, likewise impressing her audience with a talk on
                    "Woman's Place in Government." "Home and its protection, and the
                    vocations of women demand the ballot supremely," she said, citing laws favorable to women
                    and children recently passed in 
                        Colorado
                     as examples of what women's votes could do. Her speech, printed in full in the
                    morning newspaper, was described as "a great pleasure"; the speaker was said to be
                    "[c]harming, most attractive, and very forcible."51
            
            Beginning in February 1912, under chairman Katherine 
                        Hamilton
                    , the suffrage society began a series of classes on local government. Following
                    practices widely used to recruit new members, club women also held teas in political wards. In a
                    clear indication that activity in other states was now of major interest, at the end of March,
                    Banning gave a detailed speech entitled "Recent Legislative Victories" to the 
                        Allen County
                     WCTU convention. In April, Carolyn Fairbank and Addie Guldlin represented Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's suffrage society at the first state convention of the newly organized
                    Woman's Franchise League of Indiana in 
                        Indianapolis
                    .52
            
            Inspired by their connections with other suffragists, in April 1912 Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women, led by Guldlin, demonstrated a new assertiveness. Guldlin was the single female
                    member of the civic improvement association, and she (along with the Woman's Club League)
                    supported a $200,000 bond initiative to improve the city's riverbanks and build
                    boulevards. Guldlin put city council members on notice that women were eligible to vote at the ward
                    meetings where such issues were decided: "You see the women can vote as well as the men at
                    the ward meetings which are being held with the city council," she said. Unfortunately, the
                    meeting of the Sixth Ward was crowded with citizens living nearest the land donated for a city park.
                    The neighbors opposed the proposal, and Guldlin was accompanied by only two other women supporters.
                    When they asked if they might vote, the acting chairman told the women that only legal voters were
                    so entitled. The bond issue was then soundly defeated by a vote of 350 to 166.53

            Despite this failed foray into the male political domain, local club women demonstrated an unwavering
                    support for suffrage at the annual meeting of the Indiana Woman's Club Federation, held in
                    Fort 
                        Wayne
                     the following October. Although the state federation was known to be conservative by
                    nature, local and state leaders hoped that the convention would officially endorse suffrage,
                    following the precedents recently established by federations in 
                  Illinois, Wisconsin
               ,
                    and 
                        Minnesota
                    . Anticipating a victory, local suffragists planned a luncheon celebration at the
                    downtown Anthony Hotel. Deeply disappointed when the convention failed to bring the resolution to a
                    vote, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     club women nevertheless continued with their plans, entertaining over two hundred
                    women, including state federation officers and guest speakers. Beginning the luncheon with a rousing
                    suffrage song, the women expressed great confidence in their future victory, celebrating their
                    common cause in what was described as a "suffrage feast."54
            
            During this period of revitalization, the WCTU gained new energy as well. As noted above, an all-day
                    session at 
                        Plymouth
                     Congregational Church in March 1912 had included Banning's address on
                    "Recent Franchise Victories." While another speaker stressed that suffrage should
                    not be the organization's main priority, discussions were nevertheless lively and
                    enthusiastic. At a meeting at the end of December, Martha Ridenour, president of the local chapter,
                    described their organization as "one of the greatest working forces for the enfranchisement
                    of women" and stressed that the WCTU intended to work harder the next year.55
            
            A brief description of leaders in 1912 demonstrates that Fort 
                        Wayne
                     suffragists generally resembled suffragists elsewhere. Most had college educations,
                    were Anglo-American, and were active in a variety of organizations. Those who were married often had
                    husbands who were prominent in the community. Single women were predominantly professionals and
                    civic leaders. Following national patterns, African American women, except for a limited presence in
                    the WCTU, were excluded. Suffrage groups and the WCTU now mostly attracted separate memberships
                    Furthermore, unlike groups in larger cities, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     suffragists made no efforts at this stage to reach out to working-class women.56

                  56 Giele argues that suffragists were critical of the evangelical approach
                        of temperance women; conversely, WCTU members resented suffragists for being more socially
                        influential. In 1906,
            
            
            Dr. Carrie Banning (1857-1950) was a native of 
                  Geneva, New York
               , a Phi Beta
                    Kappa graduate of the University of 
                        Wisconsin
                    , and the mother of three children. Banning practiced medicine in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     for 52 years. Carolyn Randall Fairbank (18547-1918) led musical and art groups in the
                    city and served two terms as president of the Indiana Federation of Women's Clubs. Her
                    husband, Clark Fairbank, was one of the leading life insurance men in northern Indiana; her father, 
                        Franklin
                     Randall, an early mayor of Fort 
                        Wayne
                    . Addie B. Guldlin (1864-1935), a native of Stratford, 
                        New York
                    , and graduate of Buchtel College in Akron, 
                        Ohio
                    , was prominent in dozens of Fort 
                        Wayne
                     clubs and served on numerous civic boards. A leader of the local Woman's Club
                    League, Guldlin also served as national chairman of the home economics department for the General
                    Federation of Women's Clubs. Her husband, Olaf Guldlin, was founder and director of the
                    Western Gas Construction Company in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    . Banning and Fairbank were both members of the Daughters of the American Revolution.
                    Banning and Guldlin both participated in WCTU activities. Martha J. Ridenour (1861-1921), a native
                    of Canton, 
                        Ohio
                    , and graduate of Fort 
                        Wayne
                     Methodist College, championed temperance and suffrage as a WCTU leader for over 30
                    years. Katherine 
                        Hamilton
                     (1862-1932), a cousin to Edith and Alice 
                        Hamilton
                    , was long active in local musical and art societies. Finally, two other single women
                    strategic to the 1912 suffrage revitalization represent slightly divergent backgrounds. Minnette
                    Baum (1879-1956), a native of Russia and Jewish by faith, graduated from the University of 
                        Chicago
                     and studied at the Sorbonne in 
                        Paris
                     and at the University of Heidelberg. A professional social worker, she was a founder of
                    the Fort 
                        Wayne
                     Jewish Federation and instrumental in the establishment of the nation of 
                        Israel
                    . Last but not least, Elizabeth Sihler (18557-1928), one of nine children of Dr. Wilhelm
                    Sihler, pastor of Fort 
                        Wayne

                     Synod, was a teacher at Fort 
                        Wayne

                        Shaw urged suffragists to separate from the temperance movement. According to Springer, in 1908
                        the state WCTU urged its women to work for suffrage within their own organization. Fort

            In their growing support for suffrage, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women adopted a moderate, independent, largely non-controversial course. During the
                    1913 session of the Indiana General Assembly, generally called the "woman's
                    session," Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women had little direct involvement. They also were not active in the Legislative
                    Council of Indiana Women, an ambitious lobby, formed in 1914, representing eight leading
                    women's organizations and some 80,000 women. Avoiding conflict with Democratic politicians,
                    Fort 
                        Wayne
                     suffragists chose issues closer to home. With support from the Fort 
                        Wayne
                     Federation of Labor and with hundreds of signatures on petitions, they pressured the
                    city council to appoint a woman to the board of education. They attracted large audiences to
                    meetings in the courthouse assembly room, and they reached out to club women with elaborate tea
                        parties.58
            
            During these years of building public support, two events stand out as particular successes. In early
                    May 1914, male community leaders sponsored a well-attended Suffrage Day celebration at the Jefferson
                    Theatre. Part of the program included showing "moving pictures" celebrating
                    renowned political suffragists and the recent defeat of corrupt politicians. Dr. Warren Calvin, a
                    prominent Fort 
                        Wayne
                     surgeon, challenged his audience to think of how women could do away with vice and
                    political corruption in their own community if they were to have the vote. Rev. Arthur J. Folsum,
                    pastor of 
                        Plymouth
                     Congregational Church, and WCTU supporter, went even further: "One point that
                    I desire to emphasize is the fact of woman's intelligence. Living in an age of progress
                    along all lines of science, industry, morals and education, we are standing for political equality
                    for all persons independent of sex." The following year, suffragists invited every woman in
                    Fort 
                        Wayne
                     to a "suffrage bridge tea" at the Commercial Club. Over 600 tickets
                    were sold, and speakers included Miss Blanche Foster of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , president of the Woman's Press Club of Indiana.59

                  59 Other community leaders participating in the May 1914 event were
                        industrial and civic leader E. H Yarnelle and Rev. Carlton H. Snashall, pastor of First Baptist
                        Church. The first of two "moving pictures" was "What Eighty Million
                        Women Want" featuring Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst and Harriet Stanton Blatch. Fort

            While public support in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     was steadily increasing, suffragists still faced formidable opposition from politicians
                    allied with the liquor industry. In February 1915, a WCTU-sponsored bill granting women partial
                    suffrage cleared the Indiana Senate and was assigned to a House committee. Unfortunately, a
                    statewide prohibition bill was pending at the same time, and politicians again linked the two
                    issues. Lobbyists for the brewing industry, led by 
                        Allen County
                    's former state senator Fleming, crowded the State House and opponents defeated
                    the suffrage bill.60
            
            Despite the liquor lobby's obvious show of power, dynamics were in place to change public
                    opinion. With the outbreak of World War I, anti-prohibitionists, German Americans, and by
                    association, anti-suffragists, were looked upon by a growing number of citizens as anti-American;
                    liquor lobbyists became associated with dirty politics. In the summer of 1916 suffragists by the
                    hundreds exerted new pressure at national political conventions to persuade Republicans and
                    Democrats to adopt suffrage platforms.61
            
            While their more activist sisters marched through the streets of 
                        Chicago
                     and 
                        St. Louis
                     in hope of swaying political conventions, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women, dressed in white, rode on horseback and in decorated automobiles in a long
                    parade to celebrate the state's centennial. During the weeklong festivities, manufacturers
                    and merchants exhibited their products and wares; women from various clubs, including the
                    Woman's Club League, served as hostesses at the woman's building.62
            
            In February 1917, Indiana suffragists finally scored their first true victory in the state General
                    Assembly. A predominantly Republican legislature approved a law giving women the right to vote for
                    delegates to a constitutional convention and the right to vote to ratify the constitution. More
                    significantly, legislators also approved a bill granting women presidential and municipal suffrage.

                  A meeting of the Women's Equal Suffrage League, 1915 During the second decade of the
                            twentieth century, increasing numbers of Hoosiers, women and men, supported the issue of

                    bill, declared that he had become a suffrage convert and supported the bill. The previous month he
                    had voted for a statewide prohibition bill, and believing that he had already ruined his political
                    career, he appeared to conclude that supporting woman suffrage could cause no further damage.
                    Fleming, once again at the head of the liquor lobbyists, was finally outwitted by a politically
                    savvy coalition of temperance and reform groups known as the Dry Alliance.63

                     women, like their sisters nationwide, responded to the calls for patriotic service in a
                    wide variety of ways. Club women and working women alike turned out by the thousands to support the
                    federal Liberty Loan and war stamp drives. Alice Foster McCulloch, long active in the
                    Woman's Club Federation and in suffrage work, served as state chairman for these

                    northern Indiana. The Red Cross also trained nurses' aides and recruited nurses to serve in
                    military hospitals in 
                        France
                    . In early June 1918, some two hundred club women conducted an inventory of Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women to determine job skills as part of a national initiative. Hundreds of other women
                    took jobs at local factories to help the war effort and to support their families.64

                        Wayne
                     women also prepared for their future role as voters in the fall elections. At schools,
                    factories, churches, and the courthouse, suffrage leaders educated hundreds of women about the
                    workings of government. Notary publics were on hand to register women as voters. Franchise leagues
                    were formed at the 
                        Wayne
                     Knitting Mills and at the downtown Roman Catholic cathedral. These preparations were
                    abruptly halted in July, however, when the state supreme court decided that the constitutional
                    convention law was invalid. The following October, the court declared the municipal suffrage law
                    unconstitutional as well.65
            
            In the following months, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     suffragists, like their sisters across the state and the nation, demonstrated a new
                    determination to move the Susan B. Anthony Amendment through the U. S. Senate. In the summer and
                    fall of 1918 hundreds of women gathered signatures on petitions and sought new nonpartisan franchise
                    league members. In August, at a meeting of team captains and workers for the drive, Ross E
                    Lockridge, welfare director of 
                        Wayne
                     Knitting Mills, expressed the common goal that suffragists now shared. "We are
                    fighting for nothing less than complete democracy. â€¦ So it would be really ridiculous,
                    following our united national action in this world war, to offer the women any limited measure of
                    suffrage, territorially or otherwise." 
                        Allen County
                     suffragists were particularly encouraged by the number of men and women of German
                    descent who signed their petitions. By the end of August, memberships in the Franchise League rose
                    to 1,000; petition signatures in 
                        Allen County
                     alone totaled 7,000. At voting stations in November suffragists gathered still more
                    signatures and more league members in a

                     response that "exceeded even the fondest expectations
                    of the most optimistic." The state Franchise League reported that 
                        Allen County
                     "had made a better showing than any other county in the state up to
                        date."66
            
            Indiana suffragists experienced a hard-earned banner year in 1919. The Indiana General Assembly and
                    Governor James P. Goodrich quickly approved bills granting women presidential suffrage and calling
                    for a change in Indiana's constitution to grant women equal voting rights. In addition, the
                    General Assembly enthusiastically endorsed a memorial supporting the Susan B. Anthony Amendment.
            When the amendment finally cleared the U. S. Congress, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women worked with state Woman's Franchise League officers to assure
                    ratification by the Indiana General Assembly in the year ahead. As in their many earlier campaigns,
                    however, suffragists would find no simple conclusion. Only after months of maneuvering did Governor
                    Goodrich agree, on December 31, to call an extra, one-day session of the state legislature.
                    Furthermore, his offer was contingent upon suffragists' securing promises from all state
                    legislators that they would consider suffrage only. Two weeks later, on January 16, 1920, Indiana
                    suffragists saw their work pay off when the Indiana General Assembly enthusiastically ratified the
                    Susan B. Anthony Amendment, making Indiana the twentysixth state to grant full suffrage to women
                    under the Constitution. The journey that had begun almost seventy years earlier would grind on for
                    seven more months until August 28, when the federal ratification process ended.67

                     women were indeed living in a changed world. In early September 1920, nearly 8,000

                    December as national Mother and Child Day. Seeking a close relationship with the Indiana General
                    Assembly, three members of the League of Women Voters served on the state legislative committee to
                    advocate for interests of working women, education, and public health. In April 1921, the Fort 
                        Wayne
                     Board of Public Safety appointed four women police officers. The following November,
                    Catherine E. Dinklage was elected to the city council, where she served for four years. And
                    throughout the 1920s, beginning in 1921, two women were appointed to the seven-member school board
                    of trustees.68
            
            The broad patterns of the Fort 
                        Wayne
                     struggle resemble those experienced elsewhere. Like their Seneca Falls peers, local
                    pioneer women leaders championed the bold early goals of the women's rights movement. In
                    the final decades of the nineteenth century, however, suffragists were derailed by the intense
                    battle orchestrated by liquor interests against prohibition and, by association, suffrage.
                    Retreating from political controversy, women addressed social problems in their communities. They
                    found new public voices and meaningful roles through charitable work and women's clubs.
                    When public opinion made suffrage fashionable, women threw their tremendous energy and ability into
                    a final victory.
            Despite its common patterns, the journey of Fort 
                        Wayne
                     suffragists offers a picture of the particular difficulties women faced in areas with
                    deep cultural resistance to social change. While women forged new public roles and made significant
                    contributions to their community, it can also be argued that their successes were guarded and
                    delayed. When their initiatives challenged political or business leaders, they were silenced. Unlike
                    women elsewhere in Indiana who waged political campaigns for temperance and suffrage legislation,
                    most Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women avoided direct political involvement until suffrage gained broad popular support.
                    In a city defined by its industrial prosperity, few, if any, working-class women participated in
                    suffrage efforts until the final years

                             women were appointed to legislative committees for the Indiana League of Women

                            committee on the legal status of women. Fort

                     of World War I. Moreover, few club women voiced concerns over
                    the factory women's workplace conditions. The local suffrage movement that finally saw
                    success was, then, an elitist movement that largely embraced traditional gender roles and retreated
                    from controversy.
            Exceptions to general patterns often illustrate the complexities of social change. While the
                    relationship of temperance to suffrage was generally damaging, for example, the experience of Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women also shows a more positive side. Pioneer women's rights leaders like
                    Beulah Ninde undoubtedly gained valuable political skills in early temperance organizations that
                    were important in reform efforts after the Civil War. Around the turn of the century, small but
                    courageous WCTU organizations in 
                        Allen County
                     rekindled an otherwise dying suffrage spirit. In addition, in Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , as elsewhere, the WCTU served as a bridge that led women from concern for their home
                    and family to concern for the public good and ultimately, a commitment to suffrage.
            One question that deserves particular consideration is the degree to which suffragists'
                    experiences in Fort 
                        Wayne
                     differed from those of women in other areas characterized by resistance to the feminist
                    cause. Indiana had a reputation for being extremely conservative, even lagging behind other Midwest
                    states in political, social, and cultural change. In fact, suffrage leader Carrie Chapman Catt
                    considered Indiana one of five states that presented the most difficulties for gaining suffrage.
                    Certainly the control of the Indiana General Assembly by allies of liquor industries, as well as the
                    opposition of the Indiana Supreme Court, created formidable roadblocks to suffrage. Yet within such
                    a difficult political arena, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     suffragists seemed even more powerless and resigned than other Indiana reformers.
                    Moreover, existing studies suggest that Fort 
                        Wayne
                     suffragists were more delayed in women's advocacy than their counterparts in 
                        Wisconsin
                     and in 
                  St. Louis, Missouri
               , centers for large breweries and large populations
                    of German American and other foreign-born citizens with traditions of alcohol use. Milwaukee club
                    women, for example, pressured city officials to appoint a woman to the school board as early as
                    1895. Women of Waukesha, 
                        Wisconsin

                        St. Louis
                    , considered "the most hostile section of the state on the subject of votes for
                    women," women shared leadership of their city's public improvement program in
                    preparation for the 
                        Louisiana
                     Purchase Exposition in 1904. In 1908, 
                        St. Louis
                     women joined the campaign for reorganization of their city government. Backed by a
                    prominent businessmen's association, women formed a suffrage association  two years later. By comparison, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     club women did not begin to push for a woman on the local school board until 1913, and
                    their goal was not realized until 1921. While suffragists received some support from male religious,
                    business, and labor leaders, until the final years leading up to the passage of the Nineteenth
                    Amendment, most business and political leaders were firm opponents.69
            
            Finally, the story of Fort 
                        Wayne
                    's suffragists adds to our understanding of the resistance women faced and
                    encourages renewed respect for their long, uncertain, and cautious journey. Despite considerable
                    opposition, Fort 
                        Wayne
                     women gained new public roles and contributed much to the progress of their industrial
                    city. As their spirits were rekindled in the second decade of the twentieth century, they
                    demonstrated a passion for voting rights that could only have come from a hard-earned sense of
                    dignity and opportunity. Their long-awaited political and social empowerment was a testimony to
                    their many decades of commitment.

            The Civil City An Interview with William H. Hudnut, III
            Born in 
                        Ohio
                     in 1932, William H. Hudnut, III, was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1957. After a
                    stint on the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Board of Public Safety, he was elected to Congress as a Republican from the
                    state's 11th District in 1972. He served one term in Congress, then, in the move that would
                    gain him his greatest public recognition, ran for Mayor of 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1976. Hudnut served four terms in City Hall, finally involuntarily leaving in 1991.
                    He currently lives in the 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., area, where he is a senior resident fellow at the Urban Land Institute (ULI) as
                    well as former Mayor of the Town of Chevy Chase, 
                        Maryland
                    . The IMH conversed with Hudnut about his own career, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and the past and future of American cities. The interview took place via e-mail, and
                    extended at intervals through the second half of 2005. The final text has been edited for length and
                    continuity.
            
               Indiana Magazine of History: You weren't a professional
                    "city" person when you first arrived in 
                        Indianapolis
                     to begin your work at the Second Presbyterian Church. What were your impressions of 
                        Indianapolis
                     in those early years on the job?
            
               William H. Hudnut: When I moved to 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1963 to assume the pastorate of Second Presbyterian Church, I was struck by the
                    conservatism of the place-no federal money, support of anti-communist crusades, certain church
                    members pushing me in the direction of a personal interpretation of religion as opposed to drawing
                    out the relevance of religious principles to the public realm, commitment to a prevailing  orthodoxy and antipathy toward anything heterodox, a strong
                    John Birch Society presence, that sort of thing. I was even called a communist at a cocktail party
                    because I was wearing a red sport coat! The Sunday before the 1964 election, someone plastered all
                    the cars in our church parking lot with Goldwater leaflets. My new city did not strike me as quite
                    as open and welcoming of diversity (of race and of opinion) as cities I had previously lived in (
                        Rochester
                    , Buffalo, and 
                        Annapolis
                    ). I well remember being greeted by someone who said, "We are a town that will
                    welcome you, and then stand back for ten years to see how you do." All this made me
                    slightly uncomfortable.
            
               IMH: Leaving aside the obvious physical landmarks, how is the city today different
                    from the place that you first experienced in 1963, or even from the place you looked out the window
                    at on your first day as mayor in 1976? How much of this change is typical of urban America, and how
                    much of it reflects the unique flavor and history of 
                        Indianapolis
                    ?
            
               WH: Cities are organisms. They change all the time. They don't stand
                    still. Dick Lugar and his colleagues put Unigov and G1PC (The Greater 
                        Indianapolis
                     Progress Commission) in place (actually, it was Mayor Barton who founded GIPC, but Dick
                    greatly expanded the participation), and my administration tried to build on those foundations.
                    Looking out my 25th-floor window on my first day in office, as it were, it seemed as though our
                    central city was hollowing out, the victim of urban disinvestment. It also seemed as though we
                    needed to be more inclusive, and perhaps more willing to think outside the box and less reluctant to
                    take risks. We established a substantial list of priorities: neighborhood redevelopment, downtown
                    revitalization, improvement of police-community relations, a strong financial standing, and a
                    strategy for economic development that emphasized sports as a point of leverage. In order to
                    accomplish these goals, our policies were to encourage downtown reinvestment without discouraging
                    suburban investment, to maintain a Triple-A bond rating, to create an internal audit department and
                    have external auditors look at our books and report to the public in timely fashion, to make our
                    city as safe as possible, to promote a public /private partnership, to establish Labor and
                    Neighborhood advisory councils, to increase the percentages of women and minorities in the police
                    and fire departments, to upgrade the role of minorities in the city decision-making process, to save
                    the Pacers and attract an NFL franchise. And a few other things too!

            I guess I had best leave it to the historians to decide the extent to which we achieved these goals
                    in my sixteen years as mayor. All I can add is that I hope my epitaph will read: "He built
                    well and he cared about people."
            
               IMH: You've mentioned the structures that shaped your term in office. One
                    of them, Unigov, has to be counted one of the most significant innovations in urban governance of
                    the last century. Does Unigov still offer a model for other metropolitan areas to follow? And do you
                    feel that it has gone far enough in rectifying the inequities of service and revenue that affect
                    American metropolitan areas?
            
               WH: Unigov, along with the GIPC, laid the foundations for the emergence of the
                    modern 
                        Indianapolis
                    . It might never have been enacted if put to a referendum, because people react
                    negatively to change and have an unwarranted fear of "big government";
                    fortunately, in the State of Indiana, that was not required-only positive votes in the General
                    Assembly and a signature by the governor. This consolidation of the city and (
                        Marion
                    ) county governance followed on the heels of similar efforts in 
                  Nashville, Tennessee
               , and 
                  Jacksonville,
                            Florida
               , occurring at a time  (the late Sixties and early Seventies) when a fortuitous window for
                    such reform was open. Subsequently, 
                        Jefferson County
                     and 
                  Louisville, Kentucky
               , have consolidated, but many areas which have
                    attempted similar steps-Albuquerque, Buffalo, 
                  Pittsburgh, Wichita, Kalamazoo
               - have failed, due to opposition from the suburban
                    constituencies that had to vote on this matter.
            Unigov represented a dramatic and successful initiative to reform governance structures in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . It had several benefits, even though it also aroused opposition and lawsuits. By
                    incorporating the suburbs in 
                        Marion County
                     into the city, it widened the city's tax base, thus helping to stabilize city
                    finances and achieve a Aaa bond rating; it created a larger sense of "family" and
                    enabled business and civic leaders who resided in the suburbs to become more active in civic affairs
                    (neither I nor Bart Peterson would have been eligible to run for mayor, without Unigov); it gave
                    minority interests a larger voice in governance; it made service delivery (planning and zoning,
                    streets, trash pickup, parks, etc.) more efficient; and it centralized leadership in the office of a
                    strong mayor system. Unigov did not consolidate schools, tax rates, township and city fire and
                    police departments, nor any jurisdictions beyond 
                        Marion County
                    , and it left intact the governmental structures in the excluded cities of Lawrence, 
                        Beech Grove
                    , Speedway and Homecraft. Thus it was not a complete consolidation. It was a
                    compromise-politics being the art of the possible. I personally feel the school districts should be
                    rearranged so that the county is divided pie-shape into eight districts ranging from the center to
                    the outer county boundaries, because that would resolve some of the desegregation problems that have
                    existed over the years and eliminate 
                        Indianapolis
                     Public Schools, which has always seemed to have problems. But of course that will
                    probably never happen. Nor will annexation of territories beyond 
                        Marion County
                    , even though Unigov is bursting at the seams, and the regional dimensions of land use
                    and transportation planning require regional solutions. Also, I am pleased that the current city
                    administration has been working hard on consolidating police and fire services in the county.
            Around the country, Unigov is admired as a bold step forward, precipitated not by a crisis but by
                    reformist zeal, and several communities, such as the ones mentioned above, would like to have a
                    similar system. Today, jurisdictional boundaries that were created in the nineteenth century are
                    obsolete, because the metropolitan form has morphed from a heliocentric design, with a large central
                    city and bedroom suburbs, into something resembling a constellation, with many nodes of independent
                        
                    
                  The RCA Dome, downtown 
                                Indianapolis
                             Courtesy, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Indiana University
                            School of Medicine
                development occurring within the metro region, and many problems- like crime, traffic,
                    land development, job force training, environmental degradation, and economic development-cutting
                    across jurisdictional lines. In such areas, the Unigov model, though far from perfect, could be
                    followed as a way of addressing these problems. There is no cookie-cutter approach. Each community
                    has to figure out its own system of governance. But not to address regional issues is to ignore the
                    reality of modern-day metropolitan America, encourage sprawling development, and invite paralysis
                    caused by too much parochialism with insufficient mechanisms for collaboration.
            
               IMH: Given the city's changing needs as you've identified them,
                    do you feel that big public investments in sports, leisure, and tourism remain essential for
                    vitalizing the economic and cultural base of large, aging cities such as 
                        Indianapolis
                    ? Would you be as likely to push for this sort of investment if you were taking on the
                    mayor's job today, rather than 30 years ago?
            
               WH: It is difficult to calculate the impact of a domed stadium or similar type of
                    venue on a local community's economy and "psyche." Certainly, when we
                    built the "Hoosier" Dome in the early 1980s, it appeared to me that the benefits
                    outweighed the costs-benefits such as increased convention business (more than just the Colts
                    playing there a few times each year), an enhanced national reputation, additional hotels,
                    restaurants  and activity downtown which created more tax base
                    and more jobs, enhanced economic development opportunities, and a rallying point for civic spirit
                    and pride. For example, when I asked Neil Norrey from 
                  Rochester, New York
               , why his
                    company had chosen to purchase the abandoned Western Electric plant on Shadeland Avenue and turn it
                    into a distribution center, he responded: "Because I read about 
                        Indianapolis
                     on the sports pages, and thought you were the kind of aggressive, progressive city in
                    which I would like to invest." Some people opposed the expansion of the convention center
                    on the grounds that the money should have gone to housing, filling chuckholes, and that sort of
                    thing, but these persons missed the point that the entire $80 million raised from the
                    public and non-profit sectors to finance the deal were earmarked for that purpose and could be used
                    for none other.
            Now, over twenty years later, this stadium has the smallest capacity of any in the NFL. Times change.
                    Competition is keen. If a new stadium is necessary to keep the Colts in town, and if the convention
                    center needs to be expanded, I am in favor of it because, in spite of the cost in public funds, the
                    benefits mentioned above are significant. If we lost the Colts, our reputation as a major-league
                    city would suffer a huge setback that would have consequences in other areas. I think in smaller
                    markets, like 
                        Indianapolis
                     or Green Bay, the presence of an NFL team means more than it does in larger cities like 
                        New York
                     or 
                        Chicago
                    , and as mayor, I would never set-as Mayor Daley once did in 
                        Chicago
                    -a top limit on the amount of public dollars to be spent on a stadium, saying,
                    "It's my way or the highway." I do not know the particulars of the new
                    deal that has been struck in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and admittedly, I feel a little nostalgia and remorse in seeing the demolition of the
                    stadium I and others worked so hard to develop. But if in the estimate of current city leaders, the
                    new stadium is the proper step to take, coupled with another expansion of the convention center,
                    then it should be taken, with as little public money involved as possible.
            
               IMH: In your recent work at the Urban Land Institute, you've been writing
                    about your concept of "civil cities." Your take on this idea seems to me to be
                    informed by a lot of nuts-and-bolts experience that other architects and social critics involved in
                    the dialogue can't always claim to have. How has your work as Mayor affected your
                    perspectives on what makes a civil city; and, on the other hand, how have your explorations,
                    research, etc., at the Institute affected the approach you would take to the task of planning a big
                    city like 
                        Indianapolis
                     for the 21st century?
            
            
               WH: Our society and our political discourse need a big dose of civility. It used to
                    be, "I'm OK, you're OK, even though we disagree." Now,
                    it's, "I'm OK, and if you disagree with me, you are a scumbag."
                    There seems to be a lot of rancor in the air right now, feelings of adverseness if not downright
                    animosity, and a willingness, born of ideological rigidity, to fight rather than compromise. Our
                    democracy is in a precarious position right now: polarized, antagonistic, contentious, seemingly
                    unable to embrace honest, open dialogue where divergent opinions are explored. Civil society is
                    incompatible with cocooning, that is, with a refusal to consider the merits of another position
                    because one is wrapped in the blanket of one's beliefs. Certitude is never the same as
                    certainty. Democracy cannot work without civility, without respect for others and tolerance of
                    differing points of view. Disagreement is not disloyalty. No one has a corner on the truth, which,
                    like love, is a many-splendored thing, often lying somewhere in the realm of indeterminate grays
                    between absolute blacks and whites. This does not mean one cannot believe deeply and speak
                    passionately, but one should do it without selfrighteousness and with a little modesty. The genius
                    of Abe Lincoln was that he could hold to strong moral opinions without being moralistic.
            The two most civil persons I ever have met in public office are Andy Jacobs and Dick Lugar. They are
                    neither mean-spirited nor arrogant. I have never heard either say an unkind word about another,
                    whether that person be a political opponent or an angry citizen. They are open to discussion. They
                    listen. They can be a role model for all of us. I tried to be like them when I was in the
                    Mayor's office in 
                        Indianapolis
                     (and in Chevy Chase). It is important to be inclusive. Whether it was the Michael
                    Taylor incident (when a 16-year-old boy was shot while in police custody in 1987) or the furor
                    surrounding our solid waste disposal plans, I felt it was important to hold open hearings on these
                    contentious matters to give the public an opportunity to voice their opinions. Transparency is
                    always a requisite for building public trust. The mayor is an orchestra leader who tries to bring
                    people together on the same page, recognizing that they play different parts. That explains why I
                    met on a monthly basis with representatives of labor and with the members of the Progress Committee
                    (a good cross section of the community), and why I conducted four radio programs a month where
                    people could call in with their "opportunities for service." Being a mayor taught
                    me the art of listening and being inclusive, two requirements for a civil city.

            During my almost ten years of work at the Urban Land Institute, I have come to appreciate the role
                    that private-sector professionals-real estate developers, architects, marketing and financial
                    experts, consultants, etc.-can play in building a more civil society. IF they are willing to
                    exercise civic leadership. City leadership is too important to be left to the politicians.
                    Leadership is a job, not a position. Good civic leaders are teachers, enablers, communicators,
                    people who bring others together to make things happen. They are discerners of the signs of the
                    times, and engage forcefully in the crucial issues their communities are facing. They forge
                    partnerships for the common good. They promote cooperation and try to resolve tensions and reconcile
                    conflicts. They nurture the soft infrastructure of a city-dialogue, trust, civility, respect for all
                    opinions, openness, grace. They are servants of community, bridge builders, people who care and put
                    their muscle where their caring lies.
            During my travels with the Urban Land Institute, I have met many civic leaders. One that comes to
                    mind is the Simboli family in Chelsea, 
                        Massachusetts
                    . Back in the 1980s, Chelsea was a disaster area-high poverty rates, corruption, urban
                    deterioration and blight, low education- achievement scores-and the state placed the city in
                    receivership. The Simboli family decided to make some investments in Chelsea, which started the
                    city's renewal. Now, they own and operate about a half-million  square feet of commercial space there. "But we try to be good
                    corporate citizens, too," says Patricia Simboli, daughter of the family's
                    patriarch. They have been involved for many years in a program for at-risk youth. They assisted ROCA
                    (Spanish for "rock," and an acronym for Reaching Out to Chelsea Adolescents) to
                    acquire a new headquarters building in the downtown area. The Simbolis shared ROCA's
                    vision-helping Chelsea youth toward productive citizenship-and then persuaded others to share it and
                    implement it. This was civic leadership in action.
            My experience at ULI has taught me the importance of urban design and planning, something to which I
                    paid insufficient attention during my sixteen years as Indy's mayor. But a good civic
                    leader will pay attention to these matters. The mayor is the chief architect of a city. There has to
                    be a vision (as we had at Circle Centre) and a plan to follow in implementing it. Zoning has to be
                    updated as times change. Careful attention has to be paid to what's happening where, to
                    avoid unsightliness and the proliferation of one strip development after another. Historic buildings
                    should be preserved, or given new uses. Higher densities have to be created to avoid sprawl. Land
                    must be used well, green space needs to be preserved, not gobbled up with promiscuous development or
                    paved over with asphalt. Smart growth must be practiced.
            ULI has a program called Advisory Services Panels. We have conducted well over one hundred of these
                    panels in the past few years, doing about one each month. We bring into a city impartial experts in
                    land-use planning from our membership around the country. They spend a week there, interviewing
                    scores of people, touring the site for which remedial action is needed, and preparing
                    recommendations about strategic steps that can be taken to revitalize a given area. We were in 
                        Oklahoma
                     City after the bombing, in 
                        New Orleans
                     after Katrina. We have journeyed to Europe and Asia with this program, and in each
                    place we have gone, these volunteers have done an immense amount of good. Most times our
                    recommendations are taken, occasionally they are not. But the point is that our members have engaged
                    with a city, sought to help it envision and construct a better future, and given it positive
                    recommendations upon which to act. This is civic leadership in action.
            Few of us will stride across the pages of history and leave big footprints. But that does not mean we
                    cannot be leaders, that we cannot rise to the occasion to provide vision, support, and direction. To
                    each of us there come opportunities, on life's journey, to accomplish something worthy of
                    being remembered. Our job is to see and seize these opportunities with relish, and not pass by on
                    the other side of the road.

               Polite Protest The Political Economy of Race in 
                            Indianapolis
                        , 1920-1970 By Richard B. Pierce
            (
                        Bloomington

            This compact and lucidly written book explores the African American community in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Indiana, a city often neglected by scholars in urban studies and history. The first
                    chapter explores the "political meaning" of high school basketball in the city,
                    particularly the 1951 playoffs. Crispus Attucks, 
                        Indianapolis
                    's lone high school for African Americans, won the city sectional (the
                    equivalent of winning the city title), defeating all-white schools, and went on to represent the
                    city in the state tournament. The city's black leadership skillfully exploited the
                    team's accomplishment by pointing out that the squad potentially represented "a
                    spearhead for change" in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . By handling their fame in a responsible and courteous manner, Attucks players helped
                    reinforce local cultural attitudes that "rights would extend to those that showed they
                    deserved them" (p. 22).
            This style of "polite protest" also shaped the African American
                    community's struggle to desegregate the 
                        Indianapolis
                     public schools. Due to the small size of its black population, the city had more or
                    less integrated its schools during the late 1800s and early 1900s. The influx of Southern black
                    migrants and increased racial hostility throughout the 1920s led to the construction of segregated
                    schools by 1930. During the next two decades, black leaders worked patiently and sometimes quietly,
                    using all available means to desegregate the schools. As a result of a changing political climate,
                    segregated schools were legally abolished in 1949. However, the 
                        Indianapolis
                     school board  adopted only token efforts at
                    integration; Attucks, for example, did not have a white student until 1968. Twenty years later, the
                    city still grappled with desegregation.
            Chapter Three explores the housing problems facing the 
                        Indianapolis
                     black community. As in the fight to desegregate schools, African American leaders
                    utilized protest tactics they considered appropriate for their conservative community. The
                    percentage of home ownership for 
                        Indianapolis
                     blacks was higher than in any other northern city, and many African Americans had no
                    wish to threaten their status. Nevertheless, their tactics proved futile in the wake of urban
                    renewal efforts such as interstate highway construction through downtown 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Although blacks eventually succeeded in obtaining open-housing legislation by the late
                    1960s, the growing economic gap between blacks and whites operated as an effective barrier to
                    integrated housing.
            The next chapter focuses on the problems facing African Americans in a segregated labor market.
                    Because few national civil rights organizations established a presence there (the Urban League did
                    not establish a chapter until 1965), 
                        Indianapolis
                     blacks were left to their own efforts. As they had in the fights for integrated
                    education and housing, members of the black community worked patiently to gather evidence of the
                    problem and to present it to city leaders in a polite and courteous manner. By the 1960s, blacks
                    could point to the presence of equal-employment laws, but the changing economy of the city did more
                    to shape the opportunities available to blacks than did social legislation.
            The final chapter examines the creation of Unigov, a unique political structure that united the city
                    and surrounding county together under one government. Pierce argues that Unigov's creation
                    vastly expanded the political power of suburban whites while diminishing black political strength.
                    The protest tactics of patience and politeness that blacks had used in the past, along with their
                    alliance to the Democratic Party in a city ruled by a Republican mayor, failed to stop
                    Unigov's creation.
            
               Polite Protest adds a remarkable new dimension to the field of twentieth-century
                    black urban studies that will be enormously useful to students. Nonetheless, readers may wonder
                    about the possible effects of crime and the criminal justice system upon the black community. This
                    observation in no way detracts from the book's overall strength, but it suggests an area
                    for future research.

            Borrowing the framework of Robert and Helen Lynd's 1929 classic 
                        Middletown
                    : A Study in Modern American Culture, this recent collaborative
                    ethnography takes the reader into the heart of the present-day African American community in 
                        Muncie
                    , Indiana. Based upon 150 hours of interviews of sixty, mostly middleaged, residents,
                    conducted by fourteen black and white Ball State University undergraduates, the book is filled with
                    the past and present life experiences of these people, their family members, their friends, and
                    their neighbors. Part memoir, part chronicle, The Other Side of 
                        Middletown
                     tells in poignant and sometimes startling detail of the small and large moments of life
                    at work, at home, at school, and at church, as well as in the realms of leisure and entertainment,
                    local politics, community activism, and race relations. Until now, the voices and contributions of
                    these men and women who are the progeny of mid-nineteenth-century black settlers in this small,
                    midwestern industrial city have been mostly ignored.
            In Chapter Two, "A City Apart," Hurley Goodall and Elizabeth 
                        Campbell
                     provide a gripping historical account of early black 
                        Muncie
                    . They demonstrate convincingly that African Americans have been essential participants
                    in the economic growth and development of 
                        Muncie
                     for much of its history. Blacks' economic position, though limited in the
                    early years, helped to sustain a community that built its first church in 1868. With the discovery
                    of natural gas near the city in the 1880s, new glass factories and steel foundries opened, expanding
                    industrial opportunities. The black population grew significantly, as a result, from just under
                    fifty residents in 1870 to more than two thousand in the 1920s. Over this half-century, the authors
                    note, a vibrant, fully-formed black community emerged with its own newspaper, political
                    organizations, social clubs, YWCA, and YMCA. Moreover, black businesses-ranging from barber shops to
                    restaurants to a hotel and a skating rink-proliferated and diversified. African Americans even
                    provided their own civil servants, adding a black fireman and a police officer to the
                    city's payroll.
            By 1924, when the Lynds arrived, there was no mistaking that a black community existed, and in many
                    ways had prospered in spite of visible and widespread racism. The Ku Klux Klan, having been reborn
                    in several midwestern cities and upper-south towns during this period, experienced  great success in

                    . In 1922 and 1924, the Klan held major parades in the city. The 1924 parade culminated
                    in a downtown march led by the mayor and the chief of police.
            Today, these events still echo in the memories of lifelong residents. Reading the book, one gets the
                    sense that this moment crystallized the profound effect of black agency upon white Munsonians.
                    "White affirmative action" according to Goodall, one of the book's
                    principal authors and lifelong resident, has been one result. "Owing to years of
                    institutionalized racism, and its resulting de facto professional and social segregation, many
                    African Americans do not hold the kinds of high-ranking positions that would enable them to provide
                    opportunities to others" (pp. 236-37). In their seminal anthropological study, the Lynds
                    not only rendered black life and white terror invisible in 
                        Muncie
                    , they also helped to define modern American culture as a culture without race and
                    racism.
            By documenting individual testimonies, The Other Side of 
                            Middletown
                        
                is in every way meant to challenge the legacy of this invisibility and
                    oppression. From the World War II period through the Civil Rights era and beyond, the voices in the
                    book tell of the slow and sometimes uncertain destruction of segregation. They tell of black
                    teachers integrating the public schools in the 1950s, and of black politicians capturing a city
                    council seat in 1967 (which is still held) as well as a state legislative office in 1978. Black
                    Munsonians are proud of these gains, but they also have not forgotten George Wallace's 1964
                    campaign appearance at Ball State; or the 1967 race riots spurred by the adoption of the Confederate
                    flag as a school symbol; or cross burnings in the 1980s.
            These proud women and men, whose stories are co-edited by their student interviewers as part of the
                    collaborative methodology, also reveal new anxieties regarding crime, drugs, and prostitution in
                    certain city neighborhoods. Since there are few young people interviewed, these observations are
                    shaded somewhat by a generational bias. Also, scholars will at times find this work frustrating
                    because it is almost entirely a work of ethnography with no attempt to corroborate observations or
                    to deepen the analysis by drawing upon the qualitative and quantitative scholarship of black life in
                    other Indiana or midwestern cities. It is almost as if the need to place black Munsonians within the 
                        Middletown
                     canon was so great that to use data from anywhere else would be to undercut their own
                    purposes. Readers who are interested in the black experience in Indiana will value this work. Still
                    others will find the university/community collaborative approach fascinating and may be inspired to
                    adopt it.

                    The Grand Old Man of Purdue University and Indiana Agriculture A Biography of William

            The land-grant universities made their mark in agricultural education during the late nineteenth and
                    early twentieth centuries. Although the Morrill Act authorized the land-grant educational system in
                    1862, agricultural educators had little to teach and farmers generally resisted book learning,
                    preferring the received knowledge passed from fathers to sons. In 1869, Indiana became the
                    twenty-first state to accept the Morrill Act and the twenty-fourth to locate a site for the
                    university. In 1874, Purdue University became the thirteenth land-grant university to open its doors
                    to students. Little agricultural instruction occurred, however, until 1882 when William Carroll
                    Latta, a new graduate of 
                        Michigan
                     Agricultural College with a Masters of Science degree in agriculture, joined the
                    university. At Purdue, Latta played a major role in curriculum development, and he earned a
                    reputation as the spokesman for agricultural education in Indiana. He also helped organize
                    Farmers' Institutes, at whose forums university experts explained new agricultural methods
                    to farmers, based on scientific research generated at the state experiment station. In 1907, Latta
                    became director of the Farmers' Institutes, a position that he held until retirement
                    fourteen years later. By the end of his career, Latta was a generalist in a new age of scientific
                    specialization.
            Frederick Whitford and Andrew Martin, both in the Cooperative Extension Service at Purdue, have
                    written a laudatory biography that emphasizes Latta's professional career at the
                    university. By so doing, they provide a glimpse of the efforts to improve farming and agricultural
                    education through applied research and education. The authors portray Latta as the quintessential
                    extension agent prior to the official creation of the position by the Smith-Lever Act in 1914. In
                    this tributary account, Latta is a man ahead of his time, someone who never gets angry, makes a
                    mistake, or takes issue with university administration (which, in 1888, rejected him for director of
                    the state experiment station and requested his resignation because the president did not believe
                    that Purdue could have more than one professor of agriculture).
            Latta was, of course, similar to many agricultural specialists at the land-grant universities during
                    the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries- men with practical experience and some graduate
                    training who dedicated their lives to improving agriculture and farm life. The nation  owes much to the quiet workings of these individuals. Yet if Latta had
                    any shortcomings, no reader will learn about them here.
            Long block quotes and itemized lists of various sorts give this book a style and format that most
                    historians no longer use. Still, anyone interested in learning about the history of agriculture at
                    Purdue will find the book useful. Agricultural historians may find it helpful for some matters of
                    detail, particularly in relation to the operation of Farmers' Institutes. Visitors to
                    Purdue's College of Agriculture will find it a useful introduction to a man who helped the
                    university to become a center of agriculture research and education.

            William Dudley Pelley: A Life in Right-Wing Extremism and the Occult.
            By Scott Beekman
            (
                        Syracuse
                    , N. Y,: 
                        Syracuse
                     University Press, 2005. Pp. xvi, 269. Notes, bibliography, index, $34.95.)
            On December 7,1940, the 
                        Noblesville
                     [Indiana] Ledger announced that a new business was coming to town.
                    Only later did townspeople learn that the firm, a printing plant, was associated with William Dudley
                    Pelley, a controversial figure known as the "High Priest of American Fascism."
            Pelley's path to Indiana was a snaking one, along which he had seemingly reinvented himself
                    several times. Scott Beekman expertly unravels the twists in Pelley's life in William Dudley Pelly: A Life in RightWing Extremism and the Occult.
            
            Born in 
                        Massachusetts
                    , Pelley's father was variously a Methodist minister, cobbler, businessman and
                    journalist. The younger Pelley was intensely proud of his "pure English blood" (p.
                    2). His first success came in one of his father's failed careers, journalism. After several
                    years spent editing newspapers, Pelley became a short-story writer and novelist, winning two O.
                    Henry Awards for his stories. This led him to Hollywood, where he wrote screenplays, including some
                    for Lon Chaney, Sr., who became a friend. It was in 
                        California
                     that Pelley underwent a conversion experience that was the dividing line in his life.
                    His so-called "Seven Minutes in Eternity" and what the author describes as
                    "his ego and overarching desire for public recognition" (p. xv) would move him to
                    the outermost fringes of American society.
            One day in May 1928, believing that he was dying, Pelley (as he later  recounted) felt himself pulled into a blue mist. He awakened on a slab,
                    where he was attended by two kindly figures, one of whom, "William," explained to
                    Pelley that "everyone â€¦ lived hundreds of times before" and that
                    "earth was a classroom" for souls moving up the hierarchy. From the experience,
                    Pelley developed a metaphysical, pseudo-religious philosophy known as "Liberation
                    doctrine," which the author characterizes as "mixing spiritualism, Theosophy,
                    Christianity and pyramidism into a potent concoction" that earned him adherents in both
                    anti-Semitic and metaphysical circles (pp. xii-xiii).
            Pelley's anti-Semitism led him to form a group called the Silver Shirts in 1933. He used the
                    group to enter politics, pushing his anti-Semitic and anti-Communist agendas (both of which had been
                    fermenting since his travels through Russia in 1918-1919). Like similar extremist groups, the Silver
                    Shirts were more sound and fury than substance, but they brought Pelley recognition, even among the
                    many detractors who viewed him as a Hitler wannabe. During the same decade, Pelley also formed the
                    Christian Party of America, running for president in 1936. All the while, he was eyed suspiciously
                    by a public and government (particularly the Dies Committee) wary of extremists.
            By the time he arrived in Indiana, Pelley had disbanded the Silver Shirts, claiming that he wanted to
                    concentrate on publishing his philosophical ideas. But unable to eschew politics, he published
                    "anti-Roosevelt and pro- Axis material" in his new religious publication Galilean. Ultimately this led to his arrest and conviction for sedition in trials
                    in both 
                        Indianapolis
                     and 
                        Washington
                    , D. C.
            Pelley was sentenced to a term at the Federal Prison in 
                        Terre Haute
                    , Indiana. Released in 1950, he returned to 
                        Hamilton County
                     (as a condition of his parole) and continued to promote his metaphysical ideas, with a
                    dash of UFO interests thrown in. He called his new philosphy Soulcraft, and his Soulcraft Press
                    published his numerous writings, which found few adherents. Pelley faded from the public gaze and
                    died in 
                        Noblesville
                     in 1965. The night before his burial a cross was burned in front of the funeral home.
            Beekman has written a coherent, readable study. His epilogue, in particular, offers an excellent
                    overview of the life and legacy of a man now seen as a hero by some current extremist groups.

                        New Castle
                    , Indiana, native Bruce C. Smith has written a fascinating local history of World War II
                    and its impact on his hometown. The War Comes to Plum Street tells the story of
                    Smith's own family, along with that of other 
                        New Castle
                     residents who belonged to the "Greatest Generation," those Americans
                    whose lives and characters were formed during the Great Depression and World War II. Drawing
                    extensively from oral history interviews, newspaper accounts, high school yearbooks and other local
                    sources, Smith has produced a sensitively written social history that encourages readers to
                    understand the wartime years in a new light.
            Focusing on the inhabitants of 
                        New Castle
                    , located in 
                        Henry County
                    , Smith weaves together a story of individual lives, local events, and larger external
                    forces, such as depression and war, that shape people's opportunities and make up
                    America's history. Smith begins his book by tracing the history of his grandparents, who
                    relocated from the Upper South to 
                        New Castle
                     as part of a World War I- era search for manufacturing jobs. Plum Street, where
                    Smith's grandparents and their children settled, hosted many working-class families who
                    moved in and through 
                        New Castle
                     and whose labor fueled the town's Chrysler auto parts factory and a host of
                    other durable goods manufacturers. During the boom-and-bust economic cycles of the next two decades,
                    these migrants and their children struggled through the Depression and ultimately prevailed thanks
                    to neighborly kindness, public works programs, and the industrial conversion occasioned by a new
                    war.
            Using local newspapers, Smith details the many sacrifices that 
                        New Castle
                     and 
                        Henry County
                     inhabitants made to World War II. He tracks the activities of his father and uncles
                    who, along with more than 100 men and women, aided the war directly as members of the armed forces
                    and the Red Cross. He supplements this story of the war in Europe and the Pacific with accounts of
                    activities closer to home, describing industrial operations, scrap drives, and the constantly
                    changing rationing programs that occupied 
                        New Castle
                     residents. Through this enumeration, he crafts a portrait of one small town's
                    part in the larger war effort.
            Smith obviously appreciates the sacrifices made by the "Greatest Generation," yet
                    manages to avoid sentimentality and nostalgia. His discussion of the war years, for example,
                    acknowledges the social tension that characterized the era. Along with mentioning labor strife and
                    racially motivated violence elsewhere, Smith intersperses accounts of familial discord and stolen
                    rationing coupons in 
                    
                        New Castle
                    . Tracing the motivations of individual men who enlisted in the armed forces, Smith
                    downplays patriotism and suggests myriad factors that influenced decisions about when and whether to
                    join up. Centered on personal and local accounts, Smith's complicated and honest narrative
                    challenges stereotypes of a country unified by war and nationalism.
            Readers with an interest in Indiana history will find much to appreciate in The War
                        Comes to Plum Street. By treating the history of one town, and the lives of a select sample
                    of families, as important, Smith gives weight to the role that ordinary Americans play in shaping
                    history, and he demonstrates the critical part that oral history can play in recreating this
                    history. Smith's example will hopefully inspire others to investigate the events that
                    transformed towns in Indiana and across America in the first half of the twentieth century.

                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                    ) from the Midwest. Most reviewers have lauded these efforts and have touted The Encyclopedia of 
                            New York
                         City (1995) as the best of the group. The 2004 appearance of The
                        Encyclopedia of 
                            Chicago
                        
                has likely upset this ranking.
            This volume is a superb work that fulfills its editors' goal of revealing the Windy
                    City's interdependent sense of place. More than the other urban encyclopedias, this
                    handsome work literally and metaphorically maps the city's geography. It conveys a deep
                    sense of place in multiple entries on 
                        Chicago
                    's neighborhoods and locations and embeds within each entry both a separate
                    history and a connection to the larger metropolis. The result is an integrative history that links
                    the city's vital parts to a civic whole.
            Another important integrative feature of the work is the simultaneous creation of an electronic
                    encyclopedia, with an emphasis on links and extensibility. Of course, the encyclopedias created
                    before the Internet contained cross-references-the trait, after all, is common to the genre- but the 
                        Chicago
                     editors clearly were thinking of the volume as a digital product as well as a
                    traditional one.  Given this strategy, it is disappointing to
                    learn that the electronic version (http://www.encyclopedia. chicagohistory.org) appears to contain
                    nothing more than the print edition.
            The entries, arranged alphabetically, are well-written and informative. The editors' implied
                    claims to the contrary, they follow the types of entries found in other urban encyclopedias: places,
                    people, events, organizations, ethnic groups, religious bodies, and so forth. Topical essays appear
                    throughout the volume (e.g., Air Quality, Home Rule, Mental Health, etc.). Most of the contributors
                    appear to be associated with academic institutions and libraries.
            Several features are worth noting. Businesses deemed significant by longevity, number of employees,
                    or industry leadership receive separate treatment in the "Dictionary of Leading 
                        Chicago
                     Businesses, 1820-2000" (pp. 909-953). A biographical dictionary (pp. 955-998)
                    provides summary information on 2,000 deceased Chicagoans who are mentioned in the main body of the
                    encyclopedia, although page numbers to these references are not included. Census information for
                    counties, municipalities, and communities, noted at thirty-year intervals, also appears at the end
                    of the volume, as does a list of the city's mayors and a comprehensive index.
            These features notwithstanding, illustrations are the glory of this volume. No urban encyclopedia to
                    date has made better use of cartography. Thumbnail maps accompanying the entries reveal the location
                    of each county, municipality, and neighborhood within the metropolitan area, while large-scale maps
                    show everything from 
                        Chicago
                    's global and national connections (pp. 342-343) to the railroad path used by
                    the Great Migration (p. 363) to the city's freight tunnels (p. 834). The maps reinforce the
                    editorial theme of 
                        Chicago
                     as an interconnected place. In like manner, the illustrations-especially the four-
                    color Timeline and Year Pages- exceed in quality and quantity anything produced by the other urban
                    encyclopedias.
            Great cities deserve great encyclopedias. With the publication of The Encyclopedia of 
                            Chicago
                        , one of the world's leading cities has a volume worthy of its name.

               The History of 
                            Ohio
                         Law is an ambitious two-volume work containing an incredibly diverse
                    collection of twenty-two essays. It is the first in what promises to be an extremely useful series,
                    edited by Paul Finkelman, on law, society, and politics in the Midwest.
            The aim of this book, and of the series as a whole, is to fill what editors Michael Benedict and John
                    Winkler see as the "empty space" in the academic library regarding state-specific
                    legal studies. The History of 
                            Ohio
                         Law introduces the general reader to the breadth of 
                        Ohio
                    's legal history through essays covering topics such as state constitutional
                    history, 
                        Ohio
                    's judiciary, and the intersections between race, gender, and the law. The role
                    of 
                        Ohio
                    's judges, both in state and national circles, and the connections between the
                    judicial branch and the other two branches of the government receive frequent mention. No mere list
                    of subject headings, however, can capture the nuance or essence of the volumes' focus on
                    integrating 
                        Ohio
                    's legal history into a social and cultural context- both in 
                        Ohio
                     and the nation as a whole. In his forward, 
                        Ohio
                     Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas J. Moyer contends that through these essays readers
                    will see 
                        Ohio
                     as a "microcosm of America" (p. xi). The celebration of 
                        Ohio
                    's role in American history is an underlying theme in most of the essays.
            The authors of the essays are as diverse as the essays themselves. Joining Chief Justice Moyer are
                    noted 
                        Ohio
                     historian Andrew Cayton, nationally recognized legal historian Paul Finkelman, and
                    historian Barbara Terzian, who has written extensively on 
                        Ohio
                     legal topics, and a group of other distinguished historians, law professors, and
                    practicing attorneys. These authors create a book that brings together in one place for the first
                    time a wealth of legal knowledge and expertise.
            Gathering legal practitioners and legal historians together to write about 
                        Ohio
                    's legal past also highlights the differing ways in which these two groups
                    often look at the same materials. While legal historians surveying American legal history usually
                    see few jurisdictional differences, lawyers in daily practice are painfully aware of minute
                    distinctions between the various courts where they appear. Judicious readers can easily skim the
                    essay titles, and choose which vista suits their needs or interests at any given moment.
            Of particular interest to Hoosier readers is Terzian's essay on 
                        Ohio
                    's constitutional history. When reading about how public debt, the influence of
                    Jacksonian democracy, and the desire for reform of the judicial branch led Ohioans to call for a
                    midnineteenth century constitutional  convention, Indiana
                    readers have to remind themselves that Terzian is writing about 
                        Ohio
                    -not Indiana. Winkler's essay on legal literature, including the publication of
                    supreme court decisions in reporters, provokes another Indiana comparison. Winkler reports that the 
                        Ohio
                     Supreme Court did not start publishing its decisions until 1823, twenty years after
                    statehood (p. 507). The Indiana Supreme Court, through the painstaking work of Judge Isaac 
                        Blackford
                    , began publishing its decisions in 1830; unlike the 
                        Ohio
                     Reports, 
                        Blackford
                     included decisions dating back to the court's origin in 1816.
            There is occasional overlap between some of the essays, especially on topics related to the
                    transition from territory to state and the resulting dramatic power struggle between 
                        Ohio
                    's leading men and their particular interests. Still, this collection of essays
                    provides a valuable survey of legal topics designed to pique the interest of lawyer, legal
                    historian, and general reader alike. It is an excellent addition to any library.

            Karl Bodmer's North American Prints Edited by Brandon K. Ruud. Essays by Ron Tyler and
                    Brandon K. Ruud
            (Lincoln: University of 
                        Nebraska
                     Press, 2004. Pp. xvi, 383. Illustrations, appendices. $150.00.)
            
               Karl Bodmer's North American Prints is a companion publication to Karl Bodmer's America, a comprehensive catalog of the Bodmer drawings and
                    watercolors in the collection of the Joslyn Art Museum's Durham Center for Western Studies.
                    Like that earlier work, this monumental study is based on the museum's Maximilian-Bodmer
                    collection, "an unparalleled written and visual description of nineteenth- century American
                    landscape and cultures" (p. xiii) that contains Maximilian's written records and
                    hundreds of art works by Bodmer.
            In 1832, Maximilian (1782-1867), Prince of Wied-Neuweld, 
                        Germany
                    , an experienced naturalist who had made an earlier trip to Latin America, hired the
                    young Swiss artist Karl Bodmer (1809-1893) to accompany him on an expedition to the American West.
                    Maximilian's goal was to observe and record what he called the "rude, primitive
                    character of the natural face of North America" (p. 5).
            The naturalist and the artist, along with Maximilian's servant, arrived in the 
                        United States
                     in the summer of 1832 and immediately  headed west.
                    Passing through Indiana, they spent the winter at 
                        New Harmony
                    , where Maximilian fell ill with a "serious indisposition â€¦
                    resembling cholera" and nearly died (p. 14). After he recovered, they resumed their trek
                    west. In 
                        St. Louis
                     they boarded a boat headed up the Missouri River, launching a
                    3,000- mile expedition into the heart of the West, then largely terra incognita, that would last a
                    little more than a year, from April 1833 to April 1834.
            While the drawings and paintings that Bodmer created during the expedition are widely known and
                    admired, the 81 atlas prints that he produced after the expedition to illustrate
                    Maximilian's account of their journey are little known, despite the fact that the volume,
                        Travels in the Interior of North America, 1832-1834, considered "one
                    of the last of the great illustrated books of the Enlightenment," introduced Bodmer to a
                    wide contemporary audience (p. 18).
            To complete the print project, Bodmer, himself a trained engraver, selected thirty of the best
                    engravers and printers he knew to produce the aquatint engravings for the atlas. The prints also
                    were published in several important scientific publications of the time, valued for their
                    ethnographic veracity and historic significance. Infused with an aura of Romanticism, the superb
                    images go beyond the requirements of a mere document to reveal the character and humanity of the
                    Indians and the primeval, sublime western American wilderness. The famous naturalist and explorer
                    Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) praised Bodmer as an artist who viewed nature as
                    "something alive."
            This magnificent volume, edited by Brandon K. Ruud and featuring thoughtful, engaging essays by Ron
                    Tyler and Ruud, provides a handsomely illustrated, comprehensive survey and analysis of each of the
                    prints, in more than 500 illustrations of their various states and renditions.
            The volume's catalog of tableaux and vignettes, as the prints are known, is a compendium of
                    information on each print, from fundamental facts such as the dimensions of related drawings to
                    detailed discussions of each state of each print. Appendices provide yet more information: a
                    location census; a cross reference of the atlas prints and related watercolors and drawings;
                    engraver assignments and biographies (an unexpected bonus); a catalog of Bodmer's non-North
                    American prints; an inventory of subscribers to Maximilian's publication; and a compilation
                    of North American subjects after Bodmer.
            
               Karl Bodmer's North American Prints is a true treasure whose gorgeous
                    landscapes and Native American portraits, alongside the superb scholarship that illuminates them,
                    offer a gratifying experience to general readers and scholars.

            The introduction of steel plows was a leading step to the opening of the midwestern prairies by
                    pioneer farmers. Tough prairie sod could not be broken with cast iron shares, and sticky soils could
                    not be turned with ironclad moldboards. In the 1830s, a few blacksmiths used steel to make sharper
                    plowshares and some experimented with wrought iron moldboards. In 1837, John Deere, an ambitious
                    smith from 
                        Vermont
                    , newly arrived in Grand Detour, 
                        Illinois
                    , produced a plow that cut more keenly and turned furrows more smoothly than its rivals.
                    It sold well and Deere continued to improve the implement, importing fine steel and enlarging his
                    workshop. In 1848, he moved to Moline on the Mississippi River, where he built
                    a large new factory to produce even better plows for an expanding market ranging north to 
                        Minnesota
                     and south to 
                        Missouri
                    . In the 1850s, output soared from over 2,000 to over 13,000 plows a year.
            A crucial problem for the growing enterprise, examined in detail by Neil and Jeremy Dahlstrom, was
                    how to maintain a cash flow. Young pioneers who bought land on the prairies had little or no money
                    in their pockets. They needed Deere's plow to start cultivating and, until their crops and
                    livestock were sold, they remained desperately short of ready currency. On the other hand, suppliers
                    of steel demanded immediate payments in cash for material imported from 
                        England
                     or 
                        Germany
                     or transported from 
                        Pittsburgh
                    , and each week Deere had to find cash to pay wages to sixty-five workers. A long lag
                    between expenditure and income made it difficult to assess the profitability of the business. The
                    financial panic of 1857 imposed a severe strain on its credit.
            In 1858, Deere passed control of the business to his only surviving son, Charles, who was
                    college-educated and also well trained in the office and on the factory floor. Charles's
                    first task was to visit customers and dealers in the field, instructing them to make cash-only
                    sales. After the Civil War, he faced unfair competition from 
                    another plowmaker, marketing replicas of his "Moline Plow." A lawsuit ended in
                    1871 with a judgment against Deere for attempting to impose an "odious" monopoly.
                    For the remainder of the century, farmers' associations and labor unions regarded him as a
                    dominating industrial giant. Deere responded by devolving production and marketing to eight branch
                    houses located across the continent.
            This outstanding study in business history has been constructed from company archives, letters and
                    papers kept by members of the family and business partners, and files of newspapers and trade
                    journals. It is particularly illuminating on the close relations that bound industry to agriculture
                    during the pioneering period of settlement in the Midwest. In Europe, mechanization of agriculture
                    was mostly initiated and financed by large landowners and wealthy farmers. In America, the
                    manufacturer took the initiative and actively promoted his product. It is unlikely that any other
                    firm in the world produced as many steel plows in the third quarter of the nineteenth century as
                    Deere and Company, and few businessmen took greater risks than John and Charles Deere. It is an
                    enthralling story.

            Lincoln's Speeches Reconsidered By John Charming Briggs
            (
                        Baltimore
                    , Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005. Pp. xi, 370. Illustrations, notes, index,
                    $35.00.)
            No one can read Abraham Lincoln's state papers without perceiving in them a most remarkable
                    facility of "putting things so as to commend the attention and assent of the
                    people," wrote Henry J. Raymond, editor of the 
                        New York
                    
                    Times, in 1864. Still, there has been no end of difficulty in understanding
                    exactly how Lincoln's "facility" of expression managed to achieve the
                    ultimate political goal of commanding "attention and assent," Almost all of
                    Lincoln's surviving corpus of "speeches" are either texts he wrote
                    beforehand or transcripts of speech acts which a stenographer or reporter reduced to a written text,
                    with or without Lincoln's knowledge or even approval. So, at the very beginning, we are on
                    uncertain ground about what constitutes a Lincoln "speech"-is it a spoken act, or
                    a written text? Historians are further burdened with uncertainty about the rhetorical style in which
                    the spoken acts were cast. We have vanishingly few concrete descriptions of Lincoln in action on a
                    platform, and thus little  way of understanding how
                    Lincoln's patterns of delivery linked his words to the "assent" of his
                    audience.
            No wonder, then, that books devoted to unlocking the mystery of Lincoln's remarkable powers
                    as a speechmaker tend to fall into three categories: like Waldo Braden's Abraham Lincoln: Public Speaker (1988), they make as much as can be made of the slim
                    testimonies of Lincoln's voice and manner; like David Zarefsky's Lincoln, Douglas and Slavery (1990), they concentrate on the rhetorical strategies Lincoln
                    favored; or, like Harry Jaffa's Crisis of the House Divided (1859), Garry
                        Wills's Lincoln at 
                            Gettysburg
                        
                (1992) or Ronald White's The Eloquent President
                    (2005), they offer extensive, almost Talmudic, commentaries on Lincoln's texts. Because
                    John Channing Briggs is an English professor, it comes as little surprise that his new foray into
                    Lincoln as a speechmaker falls very much into the third category-and given the sheer volume of such
                    commentaries, this is very likely to bring an involuntary sigh to the lips. That would be a mistake,
                    for Briggs's book turns out to be one of the most effective examples of the
                    Talmudic-commentary style, and indeed, one of the best books on Lincoln as a rhetor.
            
            Briggs wisely avoids the pitfall of assuming that eloquence is a given. His first chapter, on
                    rhetorical contexts, considers (in the style of Kenneth Cmiel's Democratic
                        Eloquence) just what place oratory had in a nineteenth-century republican environment, both
                    on the giving and the receiving ends. Context also governs Briggs's first commentary-on the
                    1838 Lyceum Speech-as he carefully compares Lincoln's analysis of the problem of preserving
                    "republican institutions" from "mobocracy" with contemporaneous
                    speeches by Martin 
                        Van
                     Buren and Andrew Jackson. He also has a particularly acute ear for picking up obscure
                    parallels, such as the apostrophe, "Hail fall of Fury! Reign of Reason, all hail!"
                    in Lincoln's 1842 
                        Washington
                     Temperance Address, and the salutation of the Witches in Macbeth, so that Lincoln
                    "fittingly greets the demise of a Macbeth- like tyrant within the drinker" (p.
                    74). The gem of the book, however, may be the one chapter not devoted to a single speech, but
                    instead to a theme-"Presidential Eloquence and Political Religion"- which examines
                    the strands of religious rhetoric and allusion in Lincoln's speeches.
            There are, unhappily, two great drawbacks to the intensity with which Briggs scans Lincoln's
                    texts. The first is that the further Briggs moves into examining texts, the less we learn about them
                    as "speeches" and the more completely the book becomes an exercise in textual
                    commentary. The other is that twelve of the thirteen chapters are devoted to Lincoln before his
                    inauguration; the last chapter must gallop panting through the First Inaugural, the 
                        Gettysburg
                     Address, and the Second Inaugural so that the book can live up to its title.  And yet, even within those confines, Briggs's midrash on the 
                        Gettysburg
                     Address manages to do as much in ten pages as Garry Wills did in his entire misbegotten
                    book. In fact, taken generally, Lincoln's Speeches Reconsidered does a
                    finer job than any of the other commentaries on Lincoln's speeches Qaffa alone excepted),
                    and its reading will repay richly the serious student of Lincoln and of American political ideas in
                    general.

                    Wiley & Sons, 2003. Pp. vi, 282. Illustrations, note on sources, index. $24.95.)
            Thomas Goodrich's Darkest Dawn: Lincoln, Booth, and the Great American
                    Tragedy is a well-researched account of the events surrounding Lincoln's
                    assassination. Like the best historical works, the book effectively weaves a deep and broad
                    collection of sources into a unified narrative that smoothly propels readers along the path of
                    events from the fall of 
                        Richmond
                     in April 1865 to the commitment of Mary Todd Lincoln in May 1875. Goodrich, in sum, is
                    as effective a storyteller as he is an historical researcher.
            Goodrich tells the well-worn story of Booth's assassination of Lincoln, and his subsequent
                    capture and death. He also traces the response of major political leaders like Secretary of War
                    Edwin Stanton, on whose authority hundreds of citizens-many of whom had nothing to do with the
                    assassination-were arrested and imprisoned in a climate of anger and suspicion. But what makes the
                    book particularly valuable and interesting is the author's focus upon the emotional and
                    often violent reactions of ordinary people. In locales North and South, citizens expressing sympathy
                    with Booth or satisfaction with Lincoln's assassination were likely to find their lives
                    quickly ended by griefstricken, angry fellow citizens. Among the many acts of summary  retribution were shootings and bayonettings by aggrieved Federal
                    soldiers. But ordinary citizens were no slower to shoot, hang, drown, or even butcher those who
                    lacked the proper attitude of respect and mourning. In some locales, mobs descended on the homes of
                    those not exhibiting sufficient ccoutrements of mourning in their windows.
            While Goodrich provides an elegant, if conventional, account of these events, Leonard E Guttridge and
                    Ray E. Neff's Dark Union: The Secret Web of Profiteers, Politicians, and Booth
                        Conspirators that Led to Lincoln's Death frames the same events within the context
                    of an elaborate conspiracy theory. According to this theory, a cabal headed up by Secretary of War
                    Stanton and composed of a variety of groups, including desperate Confederates grasping at any
                    opportunity to further their cause, Radical Republicans unhappy with Lincoln's moderation
                    toward the South, and Northern and Southern cotton speculators unhappy with Lincoln's
                    increasing intolerance of their black market trade, conspired to kidnap Lincoln as a means of
                    advancing their disparate agendas. Booth was to play only a supporting role in the conspiracy, but
                    took matters into his own hands when the conspiracy unexpectedly unraveled.
            The theory is intriguing and reminiscent of the kinds of theories revolving around the assassination
                    of John F Kennedy. The authors fit together facts, events, motives, and personages into a unique
                    narrative that suggests that coincidence is, in reality, conspiracy. Unfortunately, the precise
                    sources for each particular claim are somewhat difficult to verify. Unlike Goodrich, whose footnotes
                    precisely document each claim and source, Guttridge and Neff provide only a general set of notes on
                    sources for each chapter. But one source looms particularly large for them- the fugitive writings of
                    Stanton's operative 
                        Lafayette
                     Charles Baker, the man who directed the pursuit of John Wilkes Booth. Baker's
                    knowledge of the alleged conspiracy is said to have resulted in an inordinate number of attempts on
                    his life, but the evidence is, quite literally, difficult to discern. Baker's writings
                    revealing the conspiracy are said to have been surreptitiously recorded in the margins of an issue
                    of Colburn's United Service Magazine and Naval Military Journal. These
                    marginal notes were recorded in a cipher, and written in a kind of invisible ink that was supposed
                    to become visible when exposed to direct sunlight but proved recalcitrant until exposed to tannic
                    acid.
            If this theory is even partially true, it requires a thorough reaccounting of the events that ended
                    the Civil War. Indeed, it is intriguing to re-read Goodrich in light of this conspiracy theory,
                    because some events in his account lend circumstantial support to the conspiracy claim. In
                    particular, Goodrich writes that in the immediate aftermath of the assassination "Stanton
                    alone kept his  wits and continued with almost superhuman focus
                    and energy," even assuming the role of "acting head of state" (p. 168).
            In sum, the strengths and weaknesses of these books seem complimentary. Goodrich provides a
                    well-researched and extremely welldocumented account of the events surrounding Lincoln's
                    assassination that can be criticized, at worst, as being overly conventional. On the other hand,
                    Guttridge and Neff make audacious claims that, if true, require a complete re-write of history,
                    though their claims may be said to be somewhat less thoroughly documented. This reader will leave it
                    to the specialists to adjudicate the dispute between these two very interesting books.

            Pictures of Home A Memoir of Family and City By Douglas Bukowski
            (
                        Chicago
                    : Ivan R. Dee, 2004. Pp. 245. Illustrations. $26.00)
            One of the finest attributes of social history is its conviction that the average person's
                    life is an authentic part of the human saga, as genuine as tales of the rich or powerful. Birth and
                    death, childhood and work, love and heartache all mix together; the challenge for historians is to
                    construct narratives from such fragmented sources as property records, census data, neighborhood
                    newspapers, and oral histories.
            
               Pictures of Home is a different type of historical resource. Photographs from
                    family albums and bureau drawers inspire some of the author's recollections. Small
                    photographic reproductions precede each chapter. Intermittently, the author muses about the emotions
                    captured in these moments. But the thematic glue that holds this book together is found in its
                    subtitle: memoir, reflections on the everyday lives of aunts and uncles, grandparents and neighbors,
                    parents and siblings. The "pictures" in this volume are not so much silver images
                    recorded on paper as flashes from the author's memory.
            The setting is 
                        Chicago
                    's South Side, for the most part after World War II. The story begins in the
                    Bridgeport neighborhood, not far from Richard J. Daley's home turf, where the
                    author's immigrant ancestors first planted their American roots before relocating to the
                    bungalow belt on the city's southwest side. At 54th Street and Homan Avenue, the Bukowski
                    family joined a melting pot of nationalities (but not races) in activity spaces revolving around a
                    memorable  grocery store, doctor's office, savings and
                    loan, movie theater, and, most importantly for this clan, St. Gall Catholic Church. Chicagoland
                    serves as a dynamic stage across which the family moves in the course of their daily activities. The
                    universe beyond Gage Park is epitomized by nearby Municipal (later Midway) Airport, at the time 
                        Chicago
                    's portal to the rest of the world. But the farthest most family members
                    venture is to the old neighborhood to visit relatives, to Comiskey Park, to downtown for a few hours
                    of shopping along State Street, across 
                        Madison
                     Avenue (the city's socio-spatial dividing line) for some magical thrills at
                    Riverview Amusement Park, or to a suburb to bury family members at Resurrection Cemetery. What
                    readers encounter is not so much a sense of community as a memoir of place-locations where life
                    unfolds. And although the setting may be 
                        Chicago
                    , the broader context is any urban place where prewar ethnic Americans reinvented
                    themselves as postwar suburbanites. The lifestyles are typically urban midwestern.
            The book's five chapters unfold in roughly chronological order, but within each unit, events
                    occur in a stream-of-consciousness style that may annoy some readers. There is no fixed progression
                    within each chapter. Dates jump back and forth congruent with the author's flashes of
                    memory. An accomplished historian, Bukowski chose not to mine each episode for its historical
                    significance- with the exception of race relations, 
                        Chicago
                    's Gordian knot. Readers partake of everyday details in the lives of people who
                    are neither relatives nor neighbors. Aging and death are subtexts in this odyssey. Therefore readers
                    must be willing to appreciate the intimacies that social history celebrates, the exhilaration of a
                    grandchild's birth or the exasperation of an elderly parent who fails to get to the
                    bathroom in time. Whether we formally publish our family history or not, the grim and graceful
                    "pictures" that we have all recorded are vital and genuine. Doug Bukowski has
                    proven that point.

            The Uncivil War Irregular Warfare in the Upper South, 1861-1865 By Robert R. Mackey

            U.S. Army officer and Pentagon policy expert Robert R. Mackey's revised 
                        Texas
                     A&M University dissertation provocatively revisits Civil War raiding and
                    guerrilla warfare, in a work of considerable relevance to Hoosier Civil War historiography.
            Mackey faults many prior accounts for imprecisely defining, and thereby rendering virtually
                    interchangeable, discreet contemporary terms for Civil War irregular troops- especially
                    "guerrilla," "partisan," and "partisan
                    ranger." Further, he contends that Civil War scholarship understates the extent of
                    unconventional fighting in the Upper South and obscures the symbiosis between irregular cavalry and
                    partisan operations and the campaigns of primary Confederate armies. He argues provocatively that
                    Confederate leaders astutely grounded their bid for independence on a "cohesive strategy of
                    irregular warfare" (p.22), and that cavalry and partisan raids were no mere sideshow. In
                    fact, so many such operations occurred that Upper South Confederate civilians commonly conceived the
                    war as defined by "ambush and raid, isolated blockhouse, and burned home," rather
                    than by "setpiece battles" (p. 3).
            Mackey meticulously deconstructs the Upper South's war. His most original chapters concern 
                        Arkansas
                    , where Confederate general Thomas C. Hindman, trying to fend off Union invading forces
                    with diminishing manpower, initiated guerrilla resistance anticipatory of twentieth- century
                    struggles. Hindman's june 17, 1862, "Band of Ten" order from his 
                        Little Rock
                     headquarters called on Arkansans to organize themselves into ten-man independent
                    companies to harass the enemy "without waiting for special instructions" (p. 207).
                    Other chapters assess and de-mythologize the 
                        Virginia
                     campaigns of John Singleton Mosby's officially authorized "partisan
                    rangers" and the 
                        Tennessee
                     and 
                        Kentucky
                     operations of John Hunt Morgan's and Nathan 
                        Bedford
                     Forrest's regular cavalry, as well as Morgan's famous "Great
                    Raid" of 1863 to Indiana and 
                        Ohio
                    . Mackey argues that so long as Union officers mistook Confederate cavalry and partisan
                    units for bushwhacking guerrillas, Confederates held the advantage. Once Union authorities by 1863
                    conceptualized them as appendages to official Confederate operations, they effectively neutralized
                    the Confederate irregulars with an array of innovations-including troop concentrations, improved
                    fortifications (especially railroad block- houses), and clever deployments of  gunboats. "Mosby's Confederacy" had more
                    staying power than did the Confederate irregular resistance in 
                        Tennessee
                     and 
                        Kentucky
                    , but Union authorities in 
                        Virginia
                     also took remedial action, such as General Benjamin Kelley's armored railcars
                    on the B&O-aptly dubbed "ironclads." Meanwhile, Union authorities pacified
                    much of 
                        Arkansas
                     with fortified agricultural colonies and other responses. Mackey argues that
                    comprehending the Union's success in parrying Confederate irregular warfare- and the
                    horrific reprisals, wanton atrocities and pillaging that accompanied guerrilla fighting from 1862 to
                    1864-resolves the longstanding puzzle of why Confederate leaders in 1865 rejected all-out guerrilla
                    warfare as an alternative to surrender.
            Mackey references Carl von Clausewitz, Antoine Henri de Jomini, and other military theorists to
                    contextualize his story within the history of warfare. Useful appendices (the 1862 Confederate
                    Partisan Ranger Act and Hindman's "Band of Ten" order) supplement the
                    text. Some readers may find Mackey's frequent redundancies annoying, and no one should
                    judge The Uncivil War by the map on page 4: it shows Grant in 1863 campaigning on
                    a straight line directly southwest from 
                        Pittsburgh
                     Landing to Vicksburg, and Sherman in 1864 marching directly eastward from 
                        Atlanta
                     to 
                        Charleston
                    . But these are minor flaws in a well-documented, thoughtfully organized, and ultimately
                    convincing analysis that builds on recent treatments of Civil War irregular action by Mark Grimsley,
                    Michael Fellman, and other scholars. Because of Mackey's labors, our understanding of the
                    Upper South's Civil War will never be quite the same.

            Signs in America's Auto Age Signatures of Landscape and Place By John A. Jakle &
                    Keith A. Sculle
            (

            John Jakle and Keith Sculle are well-known writers on the landscape of the automobile age in the 
                        United States
                    . They have crafted books on the gas station, the motel, and fast food restaurants; now
                    they have written a book on roadside signs.
            In section one, the authors study the variety of commercial signs found on town and city Main
                    Streets, and  along the rural roadsides. They pay particular
                    attention to billboards and to storefront display windows, and claim that the overall assemblage of
                    facilities (signs, buildings, and parking lots) "created a visual ensemble exciting and
                    inviting. They did not amount to chaos, as traditionalists decried" (p. 46). This claim
                    positions them in opposition to cultural geographers such as Pierce Lewis and Wilbur Zelinsky, who
                    have made a strong case that outdoor commercial signs are an abomination.
            In section two the authors look at traffic signs, specifically those created after the federal
                    government, in 1935, issued a manual standardizing such signs for regulation, warning, and guidance.
                    They also consider those signs of community that proclaim faith in "God, country, family,
                    and the neighborhood" (p. 76). There are curious omissions in both categories. The authors
                    did not include signs connected to houses of worship, street signs, or specific neighborhood signs.
                    They do look at signs boosting specific states, as when they examine the signs along the Lincoln and
                    Dixie Highways, two early crosscountry roads promoted by automobile manufacturer Carl Fisher of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Billboards along these highways proclaimed the advantages of each state they passed
                    through. 
                        Florida
                    , where Fisher had huge personal stakes as a real estate developer, was, along with 
                        California
                    , the biggest winner.
            In the third section of the book, the authors turn to signs of personal identity. The issue seems
                    particularly pertinent in this age of globalization, characterized by massive internal and
                    international migration, and by a bombardment of information which produces cultural confusion in
                    many migrants. The authors' treatment of this subject, however, is not terribly profound.
                    They dwell on consumerist aspirations to upward mobility, enhanced by advertising signs, and on
                    signs that mark territory and discourage encroachment, invasion, and contamination.
            The fourth section of the book takes on the aesthetics of signs. While signs were used for
                    "wayfaring" through landscapes, too many signs could lead to
                    "blight." In the best chapter in this section, on the history of sign regulation,
                    the authors document the war between the advocates of the City Beautiful movement and outdoor
                    advertisers. Because it was legally difficult to block the erection of billboards on aesthetic
                    grounds, the critics of billboards had to base their arguments on issues of public health and
                    safety. Four states have been more successful than others in regulating billboards:
                            
                  Vermont, Maine
               , Alaska, and 
                        Hawaii
                    . Each places critical importance on the beauty of nature for attracting both tourists
                    and migrants.
            The authors close with the euphemism that "who regulates signs controls the future"
                    (p. 169), and their book richly documents this claim for automotive America. This is a useful and
                    important work, but I found it  wanting in writing style when
                    compared to the crisper language and tighter focus of their earlier books on the motel, the gas
                    station, and fast food chains.

            The approach of the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth seems to have induced Southern 
                        Illinois
                     University Press to produce paperback editions of four interesting books that highlight
                    Lincoln's relation to Americans via his private secretaries. The Lincoln White House
                    received somewhere between 250 and 500 pieces of mail each day, out of which his secretaries
                    selected 10 to 20 for his personal attention. Dear Mr. Lincoln presents the text
                    of letters seen by Lincoln between 1860 and 1865, organizing them into ten topical
                    categories-advice, requests, compliments, complaints, inventions, gifts, business, invitations,
                    family matters, and threats. Harold Holzer prefaces each chapter with an introduction and makes note
                    of the nature or existence of the president's replies. Holzer's second volume, The Lincoln Mailbag, grew out of interest in the first. It presents additional
                    letters seen by Lincoln as well as many that were simply forwarded to others for reply. Like the
                    first volume, this also contains annotation regarding his replies, though these letters are
                    presented in chronological order without prefatory commentary.
            
            Michael Burlingame focused his analysis on one of Lincoln's secretaries, the Bavarian-born
                    immigrant John G. Nicolay who lived in Indiana (among other places) before settling in 
                        Illinois
                     where he met the future president. With Lincoln in the White House
                    presents the secretary's letters and writings organized chronologically for the years of
                    the presidency. After Lincoln's death, Nicolay set out to write a history of the presidency
                    and interviewed a variety of people in 
                  Springfield,
                            Illinois
               , and 
                        Washington
                    , D.C. in the 1870s and 1880s. Feeling that the information gleaned was too personal,
                    Nicolay eventually decided against using the material in Abraham Lincoln: A
                    History (1890), written with another White House secretary, John Hay. In An Oral
                        History of Abraham Lincoln, Burlingame edits the interviews and presents them largely in
                    the chronological order in which the interviews were conducted. For his collective work on Nicolay,
                    Burlingame received the Lincoln Prize Honorable Mention in 2001.

            The editors of this book have chronologically organized the wartime diary entries of Sergeant William
                    Bluffton Miller of the 75th Indiana Volunteer Infantry, added historical and military context to
                    each set of entries, and provided a brief biographical sketch of Miller as a soldier. The diary
                    chronicles Miller's involvement in some of the most important campaigns in the Western
                    theater, and it also uncovers the private journey of one man through the Civil War. In his writing,
                    Miller grapples with his assumptions about race, within the context of the nation's past
                    and of his own vision of the future.

            This volume abstracts the death rolls for one department (Indiana) of the  Grand Army of the Republic, the largest association of Northern Civil
                    War veterans. Each listing contains the name of the veteran, his rank, company and regiment, GAR
                    post number, age at death, and date of death, as well as from which yearly GAR state journal the
                    information has been taken. Appendices include a roster of all of the state GAR posts and their

            Anyone who has ever driven by the beautiful sight of St. Meinrad's Archabbey in southern
                    Indiana and wondered what the buildings looked like inside and what life was like for those who
                    lived there, will be interested in this extensively illustrated history, published to coincide with
                    the archabbey's 150th anniversary. Chapters discuss the early history of the abbey, its
                    abbots and monks, prayer and labor within the abbey's walls, and the parishes and
                    educational projects of the abbots and monks far afield.

            Feeling "a responsibility to share with others the tales passed on to me," Father
                    Edward Malloy, President Emeritus of Notre Dame, has collected his memories of the university he
                    attended and then served for decades. The stories are touching, funny, and illuminating of the
                    people and events that make college life memorable.

            Written to coincide with the opening of the college's new Science Center, William R.
                    Eberly's book provides a highly detailed history of how the sciences have been taught at
                    one Indiana college. Much of the text is devoted to outstanding professors and their research, but
                    the author also  considers the work of many successful alumni
                    and, of course, the growth of the institution. The book is well- produced and generously
                    illustrated. It should be of interest not only to graduates of the college but to anyone interested
                    in the history of science education in Indiana.

            This book, like so many institutional histories of colleges and universities, is divided into
                    chapters according to presidential tenure. However, 
                        Berea
                     College archivist Shannon Wilson has written the kind of educational history to which
                    other authors should aspire. The book is very well illustrated but does not rely on illustrations
                    for its primary interest. Rather than losing the reader in the minutiae of administrators and
                    policy, Wilson places the college within the context of race relations, the history of Appalachia,
                    and the history of modern educational practice, and does so in an engaging prose style. Anyone
                    interested in the history of progressive higher education in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,
                    the history of race and education in America, and the history of Appalachia will profit from reading
                    this book.

            This revised edition of the late Murray Holliday's history (originally published in 1980)
                    maintains the original text and organization while adding a biographical sketch of society
                    organizers John H. and Evaline R. Holliday and material at the end of each chapter that brings the
                    topics under discussion up to date. Chapters treat the society's history, debates over
                    membership qualifications, and the efforts to publish a yearbook, organize pilgrimages, and erect
                    historical markers. Appendices document officers, charter members, award winners, annual dinners and
                    pilgrimages, and deceased members.

            (Paducah, Ky: Turner Publishing Company, 2005. Pp. 135. Index. $37.50.)
            This handsomely bound volume clearly reproduces dozens of photographs of 
                        Whitley County's
                     people and families, buildings, businesses, churches, farms, leisure activities,
                    soldiers, social organizations, police and fire personnel, schools, streets, and vehicles. Many of
                    the photographs are undated, and the captions vary from providing full names and extensive  biographical detail (p. 19) to stating as little as
                    "Grandma Reese and Robert" (p. 6). Presented without any narrative, the
                    juxtaposition of images implicitly suggests a silent continuity of past and present. For example, on
                    page 27 a stern-faced, Victorianera couple sits with hands clasped in front of their white clapboard
                    house; in a photo immediately above, a 1990s-era senior-portrait style photo depicts two sisters in
                    jeans and sweaters seated with hands clasped, at the base of a tree-aside from a common family name
                    in both captions no other explanation is given. This volume should prove useful for its
                    dissemination of a wide variety of historical photographs depicting small-town life in Indiana.

            This handy reference brings together photographs and commentary about Indiana high school basketball
                    between 1945 and 1959, though it remains unstated why only these years were
                    "golden." Photographs depict players in mostly posed or candid settings, though a
                    few document actual play. Likewise, the commentary primarily emphasizes players and teams, with some
                    description of actual games. An appendix lists brackets and scores for each year's
                    tournament from the sweet sixteen round to the finals.

            The Lotus World Music and Arts festival has been an annual event in 
                        Bloomington
                    , Indiana, since 1994, when it began as a "let's put on a
                    show" idea that quickly took on a life of its own. Holladay has captured that hometown
                    flavor in this colorful photographic retrospective, as well as a  sense of the chaotic scramble of musicians from around the world that (somehow) always comes
                    together in a seamless "work of art and love." The accompanying compact disc gives
                    readers a small sample of the festival's musical performances.

                        Ohio

                        England
                     culture can still be found there-especially, argues Ricky Clark, in the practice of
                    quilt making. In this book, Clark has assembled richly colored examples of calamanco, T-shaped, and
                    borderless pieced quilts to illustrate those cultural connections and to demonstrate the civic and
                    commemorative significance of quilts.

                    offers an introductory history of the Indiana Glass Company of Dunkirk, Indiana, and will instruct
                    interested readers in the huge array of patterns and objects available from the company's
                    beginnings in 1896 until the final closing of production in 2002.

            Since 1991, the Exotic Feline Rescue Center near Center Point, Indiana, has been a home for big
                    cats-166 lions, tigers, leopards, ocelots, cougars, and bobcats as of this book's
                    publication-that have either grown too old for zoos and circuses or suffered abuse and neglect at
                    the hands of private owners. A foreword warns the average person of the complications and dangers of
                    owning big cats as pets, but the beautiful, full-page, color portraits of the animals paired with
                    compelling life histories will make any reader want to drive out and see them in person.

               A Place of Recourse examines the two-hundred-year-long rise of the U. S. District
                    Court for the Southern District of 
                        Ohio
                    , from obscurity to a place of political, economic, and cultural prominence. This
                    district court has helped to frame issues such as antebellum admiralty law, wartime treason and
                    dissent (during the Civil War and World War I), crime during Prohibition, legal challenges to the
                    New Deal, and many of the social/economic challenges of the late twentieth century. Judges have
                    played important roles in directing these decisions and, accordingly, Alexander devotes ample
                    discussion to the politics and personality of judges, within the context of their court rulings.

                     model company, known worldwide for intricately detailed aircraft miniatures. Created
                    from balsa wood, these models authentically replicated early plane prototypes as well as the
                    complete line of American and foreign fighters and commercial airliners. The popularity of these
                    replicas (from the 1930s to the present) and the insight hobbyists gained through constructing them
                    earned Packard the title of "Aviation's Great Recruiter," as he brought
                    the dream of flight (even if only in miniature) to thousands.
