                    territory between the meridian of Council Bluffs and the Rocky Mountains was "almost wholly
                    unfit for cultivation, and of course uninhabitable by a people depending upon agriculture for their

                    President James Monroe, following a proposal set forth by Secretary of War John C. Calhoun,

                    greater problem. The whites coveted the Indian lands, and the contact between the two races was
                    becoming more and more detrimental to the Indians, who acquired the white man's vices but
                    not his virtues. Then came word of the nature of the trans-Mississippi West. If the West was indeed
                    a great desert, useless to the whites, why not dispose of the bothersome Indians by moving them out
                    into the plains. "The concept of a 'Permanent Indian Frontier,' where red
                    men would be forever removed from the path of advancing white settlements," writes one
                    authority on westward expansion, "dawned on officials as soon as government explorers made
                    them aware of western geography. The region west of the 95th meridian, pathfinders agreed, was an
                    arid waste unsuited to habitation… . Federal officials saw a possible solution to the
                    vexing race problem in the explorers' tales. If all Indians east of the Mississippi were
                    moved to the Great American Desert their valuable lands would be opened to settlement, friction
                    between the two races removed, and natives protected from the sins and diseases of white
                        men."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Another historian remarks in his textbook: "Luckily
                    for the whites the solution of the problem of the Indians appeared obvious and easy." After
                    noting that there was general belief in the "Great American Desert," he continues:
                    "In view of the apparent unavailability of the Far West for white settlement it seemed
                    reasonable to send the Indians to that part of the country."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> A third
                    textbook speaks of the "country reputed to be desert" as offering "a
                    splendid opportunity to dispose of the Indians,"<hi rend="sup">4</hi> and a fourth notes
                    that "in the vast stretch of territory popularly regarded as the 'Great American
                    Desert' … the displaced Indian tribes were supposed to live in isolation from
                    the whites… ."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>For readers accustomed to think of American governmental policy toward the Indians in the blackest of
                    terms, this account of the removal policy makes good sense. When still another historian notes that
                    removal was in large part carried out by Andrew <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> and describes him as a "veteran Indian fighter" who
                    "accepted fully the brutal creed of his fellow Westerners that 'the only good
                    Indian is a dead Indian,'"<hi rend="sup">6</hi> the pieces of the picture fall
                    comfortably into place.</p>
            <p>Certain pertinent questions, however, need to be asked about the picture so assembled. Where did the
                    officials who formulated the Indian removal policy think the Great American Desert was located? What
                    area west of the Mississippi did they allot to the transplanted tribes? Were these two areas the
                    same? Was it the intent of federal officials to settle the Indian on useless land? And did the
                    contemporary critics condemn the removal policy because it would force the Indians out into the
                    desert?</p>
            <p>That there was common belief in the existence of the Great American Desert there can be no doubt.
                    Historians and geographers have unearthed the surveys of explorers and have pointed to the
                    popularization of these reports in the atlases and school geographies of the time.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> It is necessary, however, to re-examine the data to determine with some exactness, if it is
                    possible, just where the Great American Desert existed according to the belief of men in the
                    1820's and 1830's. Was everything west of Missouri and Arkansas considered
                    desert—as some modern authors might lead us to believe—or was the desert area
                    more precisely circumscribed?</p>

            <p>The genesis of the desert idea and its spread among the public are established facts. Lieutenant
                    Zebulon M. Pike, who journeyed across the plains in 1806-1807, reported that the area "may
                    become in time equally celebrated as the sandy desarts [sic] of Africa" and predicted that
                    white settlers would halt at "the borders of the Missouri and <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s observations, however, had little influence either on cartographers or on
                    the public mind. The first edition of his work, published in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is remarkable for the disorder of its material and the <placeName>

                    neither edition do the maps carry any notation of desert.</p>
            <p>It is Stephen H. Long who must be credited with establishing the belief in the Great American Desert.
                    In 1820 he produced a large manuscript map with the following inscription: "To the Hon.

                    others… ."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> This map has the words GREAT DESERT entered on
                    what is now the panhandle of Texas and the region immediately to the north. It was the first map to
                    refer to or delineate the Great American Desert, and it became the progenitor of several decades of
                    maps of the West.</p>
            <p>The data on Long's expedition reached the public chiefly through the report of Edwin James,
                    a member of Long's party, who published an account of the expedition in <placeName>

            <p>The popular map makers of the day copied from Long, James, and perhaps from each other. And they are
                    remarkably uniform in their portrayal of the Great American Desert. One of the earliest atlases to
                    mark the desert was that of Henry C. Carey, <hi rend="i">A Complete Historical, Chronological, and

                    south of the Arkansas River (see Plate III). It carries the additional legend about the roving bands
                    of Indians. The identical map was printed in the 1823 edition of Carey's <hi rend="i">Atlas</hi> and in the 1827 edition as well. The 1827 edition also shows GREAT AMERICAN DESERT on

                    the unusual sweep of the lettering was not due to any special geographical knowledge or conviction,
                    but to the necessity of avoiding an inset map which covered much of the area designated desert in
                    other atlases. Indeed, in the 1829 edition of the atlas the plate of North America shows GREAT
                    AMERICAN DESERT in its usual position west of the 100th meridian, astride the Arkansas River (see
                    Plate I). Wood-bridge's maps of the <placeName>

                    contemporary concept of the Great American Desert because the area is neatly stippled on the map, so

                    Red River. A similar area is marked out on the "Map of North America," but in less
                    detail owing to the scale of the map. The same plates were used again in the 1844 edition of the

                    the west, popular accounts were less discriminating. In 1828, for example, <hi rend="i">Niles' Weekly Register</hi> carried a little item on the desert, which drew ultimately
                    upon the scientific reports of Long, but which presented the data in more extravagant language for

                    by the Indians, and before his term of office ended the notion of exchanging lands in the East for
                    those in the West was introduced cautiously among the Indians.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Such a
                    movement, of course, would please the white settlers, who were anxious to be rid of the Indians, and
                    the legislature of Tennessee in 1803 politely suggested to Congress that the Louisiana Purchase
                    offered a fine opportunity to move the Indians out of Tennessee altogether.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> It
                    cannot be argued from these designs, however, that the intent was to force the Indians onto useless
                    lands, or for that matter onto lands less valuable than those they were asked to surrender. Although
                    some scattered accounts of the trans-Mississippi West were available, accurate detailed information
                    at the time was meager. One thing was clear, however: the country in the West was terribly large and
                    whites would not be able to fill it for generations.</p>
            <p>The removal suggestions of 1803 came to naught. After the War of 1812, however, the agitation was
                    renewed, and President James Monroe and John C. Calhoun worked earnestly for a change in the Indian
                    situation. Either the Indians would have to adopt the white man's way of life or move
                    beyond the Mississippi out of the way of the whites. A treaty was signed with the Cherokees in 1817,
                    by which some of the eastern holdings of the nation were exchanged for lands in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName>, and the commissioners dealing with the Indians north of the Ohio in 1818 were urged to

                    the destruction of the Indians. Although he opposed the extreme demands of the Georgians for the
                    expulsion of the Cherokees, Monroe became convinced that removal was the only salvation for the

            <p>This final message of Monroe on removal was based upon the report drawn up by Calhoun, dated January

                    burying them in the Great American Desert,<hi rend="sup">24</hi> it must be looked at closely. Where
                    precisely did Calhoun recommend that the Indians be sent? To begin with, he divided the eastern
                    Indians into two groups. The smaller group consisted of those living in the northern parts of
                    Indiana and <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s removal policy for want of any better solution to the Indian problem.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Adams' secretary of war, James Barbour, however, advocated removal
                    of the Indians as individuals rather than as tribes and in a long report of February 3, 1826, to the
                    chairman of the House Committee on Indian Affairs outlined his removal plans, the first point of
                    which was to set aside the country west of the Mississippi and between Lakes Michigan and Huron and
                    the Mississippi for the exclusive use of the Indians. He apologized a bit for including the area
                    east of the <placeName>

                    Indians then occupied the area, and that "from its natural features, [it] is not desirable
                    at present for the habitation of our citizens." There was a note of genuine concern for the
                    Indians throughout the report, as Barbour candidly recounted the evils and injustice in previous
                    dealings with the Indians. He made no reference <list type="footnotes">

                    implicit in the report that the land would be suitable for the Indians as they approached
                    civilization. Barbour's main design was to prevent future conflicts between the Indians and
                    the whites over the land, such as were then raging in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>. "The principal recommendation of this plan, next to the advantages to be
                    gained by ourselves," he wrote, "is, that the future residence of these people
                    will be forever undisturbed; that there, at least, they will find a home and a resting place; and

                    secure in possession of the land—not because the whites would never want it, but because
                    the Indian title would be absolute and guaranteed.</p>
            <p>Barbour's proposals were heartily seconded by William Clark, superintendent of Indian

                    Clark, in March, 1826, noted the changed relationship between the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and the Indians, that the red men were no longer a hostile threat to be put down by war
                    but had become instead "objects of pity and commiseration." He wanted the Indians
                    to be educated and instructed in agricultural pursuits and the ways of civilization, a possibility
                    only if the Indians could be removed from the existing contacts and conflicts with the whites. As
                    for the territory to which the Indians would be moved, Clark had the following comment: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    to move. The House resolution asked, among other things, whether the Indians were
                    "acquainted with the nature and situation of the country to which they are to be removed;
                    and to what particular district or districts of country West of the <placeName>

                    turned the questions over to Thomas L. McKenney, head of the Office of Indian Affairs and a key
                    figure in Indian policy making. McKenney in his answers gave an honest picture of the state of
                    information available to the planners at the moment. He admitted frankly the lack of knowledge about
                    the nature of the land to which the Indians were to be removed and insisted that the lands be
                    examined and proved suitable before they are allotted to the Indians. And it was land suitable for
                    agricultural pursuits which concerned him, since the advocates of removal hoped to induce the
                    Indians to change to agricultural subsistence in their new homes. There was no question here of
                    finding land suitable for nomadic hunters. In McKenney's long reply there is not the
                    slightest hint that he thought of the area in question as the Great American Desert.</p>
            <p>McKenney answered the congressional queries point by point: "The Indians are not
                    'acquainted' with either 'the nature or situation of the country to which
                    it is proposed to remove them.' The 'particular district of country'
                    which has been looked to, for the permanent home of the Indians who should emigrate west of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>; but, as no examination of it has been made, with a view to its occupancy by the tribes
                    now in the States east of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>

                    the Mississippi they ought to occupy.'" McKenney asserted that the first step
                    should be an actual examination of the western country to determine "its extent and fitness
                    for a last home for the most unfortunate of human beings." He thought it "not
                    unreasonable" that if the land in the West could be examined and judged suitable by a
                    deputation of the Indians themselves, the Indians would be willing to accept removal.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>

                    $15,000 for an exploration of the country west of the Mississippi and authorized the

                    their reports described the territory as far as they had examined it and set forth both advantages
                    and disadvantages. In general, however, the reports were favorable. One of the commissioners-Isaac
                    McCoy, a Baptist missionary and long-time friend of the Indians—declared that
                    "the country under consideration is adequate to the purpose of a permanent and comfortable
                    home for the Indians; and whatever may be the obstacles which at present oppose, they may
                    nevertheless be located there without recourse to any measure not in accordance with the most rigid

                    to provide the funds this would require. Numerous bills were introduced and reports submitted as
                    pressure on the southern Indians mounted. A strong argument for removal continued to be the
                    assertion that by moving the Indians to lands which were outside any state or organized territory,
                    the question of conflict of claims to the land would cease since the federal government could and
                    would guarantee the Indians' rights to the western lands without danger of state

            <p>The situation was complex and confusing and, to facilitate the settlement of the Indians in the West,
                    Congress authorized in July, 1832, the appointment of three commissioners with extensive powers to
                    investigate the territory, to select tracts of land for the incoming Indians, and to adjudicate
                    conflicting claims.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Secretary of War Lewis Cass gave the commissioners a long
                    set of instructions, in which he urged them to make arrangements that would satisfy the Indians and
                    thus preserve peace in the area. The commissioners were instructed particularly to welcome the
                    Indian delegations sent out to investigate the land and to see that they were satisfied.
                    "You will perceive," Cass told the three men, "that the general object is
                    to locate them all in as favorable positions as possible, in districts sufficiently fertile,
                    salubrious &amp; extensive, &amp; with boundaries, either natural or artificial, so
                    clearly defined, as to preclude the possibility of dispute. There is country enough for all,

                    &amp; every measure adopted be as much to their satisfaction, as is compatible with the
                    nature of such an arrangement." The commissioners were asked to transmit to the War
                    Department all the information they could procure respecting the territory into which the Indians
                    were to move.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The commissioners submitted a report from Fort Gibson, dated February 10, 1834. The country acquired
                    from the western Indians for the purpose of providing land for the Indians coming from the East the
                    commissioners declared to be "very extensive," running from the Red River to
                    43°30′ north latitude, and from the western boundary of Missouri and Arkansas
                    to the 100th meridian. The climate, they reported, did not "materially vary from the
                    climate, in the corresponding degrees of latitude, in the Atlantic States, some distance in the
                    interior from the seaboard," and the soil, was of great diversity such "as

                    soon be destroyed as the eastern Indians moved in. "The question then arises,"
                    they wrote," 'is the country able to furnish them a support in any other way; and
                    particularly is it calculated for the purposes of agriculture?' And this question the
                    commissioners answer unhesitatingly in the affirmative. They are <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Other reports on inspection of the lands proposed for the eastern Indians were of like tenor. A
                    treaty with the Delaware Indians for removal west of Missouri provided that the lands be inspected
                    and agreed upon before the treaty would take effect.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> The agent appointed to

                    Missouri and Arkansas lines. "I beg leave, sir, to state distinctly," he reported,
                    "that I am confirmed in an opinion often expressed, that the country under consideration
                    may safely be considered favorable for settlement: the distance, on an average of two hundred miles

            <p>By 1834 areas west of the Mississippi had been allotted to the various Indian tribes. A map of these
                    areas, entitled "Map of the Western Territory, &amp;c." (see Plate VI), was
                    prepared in the War Department at the request of the House Committee on Indian Affairs. It shows
                    definitively the lands to which the Indians were to be removed. In addition to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, which was still largely Indian country, the lands to be occupied by the Indians form a

                    </placeName>. The strips of land designated for the Osages, Cherokees, Creeks, and Choctaws extend

                    100th meridian—in order to give the tribes "outlets" to the west. The
                    lands of the other tribes are huddled in smaller allotments along the Missouri border. There is a
                    dotted line on the map running north and south from the Platte to the Red River, approximately two
                    hundred miles west of the Arkansas and Missouri boundaries, which is labeled "Western
                    boundary of habitable Land." All the districts except for the outlets of the Osages,
                    Cherokees, Creeks, and Choctaws lie to the east of this line. None of the areas falls within the
                    region commonly designated on the maps of the day as the Great American Desert.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

            <p>Although the removal policy was carried out with determination, critics of the program were not
                    lacking. As aggression against the southern Indians increased and as the movement in Congress in
                    1829 and 1830 to pass a removal bill gained momentum, the outcry against forcing the Indians to move
                    reached great heights. Senator Theodore Freling-huysen of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Senator Peleg Sprague of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and others made long speeches in defense of Indian rights, and the press was filled
                    with articles condemning the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> policy.</p>
            <p>What did these loud and determined critics have to say about the lands in the West to which the
                    Indians were to be removed? Did they condemn <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s policy on the ground that the Indians were to exchange good land in the East
                    for desert country in the West? It is remarkable how seldom this question entered into the argument.
                    Senator Sprague, it is true, condemned the policy of moving the Indians "to a distant and
                    an unsubdued wilderness" and "to frowning forests, surrounded with naked
                        savages."<hi rend="sup">47</hi> But his concern was <list type="footnotes">

                    desert characteristics of the land.</p>
            <p>The great argument against removal rested on the guaranteed rights of the Indians to the lands they
                    occupied in the East and on the force of existing treaty obligations. The innumerable memorials
                    which poured into Congress from the North and Northeast had as their plea that the rights of the
                    Indians to their lands in the East be protected. The memorials did not argue about the quality of
                    land to be given the Indians in the West. Had there been indications that the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> administration intended to send the Indians into worthless desert land, it is
                    inconceivable that this fact would not have been pounced upon by the administration's
                    critics.</p>
            <p>The most important spokesman against removal in 1829 and 1830 was the Reverend Jeremiah Evarts,
                    secretary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The missionaries of the American Board had been prominent in the Cherokee nation and
                    strongly supported the Indians in their refusal to move. Evarts, as the most articulate spokesman of
                    the group, published a series of articles under the name "William Penn" in which
                    he exhausted the arguments against <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Georgians. These articles appeared first in the <hi rend="i">National
                        Intelligencer</hi>and then were circulated widely in book form.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Only in
                    the final article, Number XXIV, did Evarts advert to the land in the West. He described it as
                    prairie land, not as desert; and he questioned its suitableness for the Indians because of the lack
                    of streams and timber. "The vast prairies of the west will ultimately be
                    inhabited," he remarked. "But it would require all the wealth, the enterprise, and
                    the energy, of Anglo-Americans, to make a prosperous settlement upon them." Because the
                    land <hi rend="i">was</hi> habitable, however, Evarts argued that the removal plan would settle
                    nothing permanently: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            time, the pressure upon the Indians will be much greater from the boundless prairies, which
                            must ultimately be subdued and inhabited, than it would ever have been from the borders of

            <p>This was remarkable prescience. It is also a clear indication that Evarts did not think the Indians
                    were being moved to a sterile wasteland.</p>
            <p>What conclusion, then, is to be drawn about the relationship between the concept of the Great
                    American Desert and Indian removal?</p>
            <p>The idea of removal—that is, the exchange of lands in the East for lands in the
                    West—originated in Jefferson's administration, when the Louisiana Purchase made
                    the scheme feasible. The plan then developed slowly. Removal treaties were signed from 1817 on, with
                    the urgency for removal increasing as the desire of the whites for eastern lands increased. In the
                    1820's the agitation reached new heights because of the action of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> and other southern states to force the Indians form their land holdings in those
                    states. The Cherokee action in adopting a new constitution, which emphasized their sovereignty
                    within the state of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, and the discovery of gold on the Indian lands brought matters to a head, and after
                    some delay Congress in 1830 enacted legislation which provided the means for carrying out the
                    removal policy that had been adopted by President Monroe and supported by his <hi rend="i">successor,</hi> John <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>
                    </placeName> Adams. The adoption and speeding up of the program in the 1820's was
                    occasioned by events in the East—not in the West. The idea of the great desert found in
                    the reports of Long's explorations had nothing to do with the origin or the development of
                    the removal policy.</p>
            <p>When the time came to make definite allotments of land for the eastern Indians, considerable pains
                    were taken to investigate the nature of the West in order to make sure that it offered suitable
                    resources for the Indians. Delegations of the Indians were sent to look at the land for themselves
                    before accepting the allotments. Sympathetic friends of the Indians who had first-hand contact with
                    the region reported favorably on its suitability. Opponents of removal offered little criticism of
                    the policy on the basis of giving the Indians poor land in return for what they relinquished in the
                    East. Nowhere did Long's report enter into the discussion.</p>

                    generally conceived at the time to be an uninhabitable desert. If this was due to conscious policy,
                    the idea that the Indians were deliberately disposed of in the desert loses all credibility. If this
                    happened only by chance, because of lack of accurate knowledge about the West or because of failure
                    to consider this aspect of the question at all, the officials who engineered removal cannot be
                    accused of intentionally removing the Indians to a useless wilderness.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt that the removal policy brought hardship and injustice to the Indians. The red men
                    were forced to move from their cherished ancestral lands, to which their rights had been clearly
                    guaranteed. But the removal plan was never a scheme to dump the Indians into the desolate wastes of
                    the Great American Desert.</p>

                    West and the countless frustrations and obstacles which stood between this ideal and its
                    realization. Drawing upon the enthusiasm and talents of leaders of the Indiana Territory and

                    successful launching of a college program. There were chronic shortages of money, of

                    a continuing school program and was apparently forced to suspend its academic functions at various
                    times. In fact, in this regard <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University conformed to the general pattern of such suspensions among American colleges
                    founded in the ante-bellum period when religious sects and state governments zealously created
                    colleges and universities in excess of adequate faculties, student bodies, and means of financial
                    support.</p>
            <p>The present installment of the minutes begins in October, 1828, following a lapse of more than four
                    years for which no official records have been found. In the meantime, the Indiana General Assembly
                    had in 1824 established the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName> Seminary and initially vested its administrative control in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> University board of trustees.<hi rend="sub">4</hi> Funds for the support of the
                    seminary's educational program and the maintenance of the "seminary"
                    building were to include the penal funds collected within <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName>. In this provision the General Assembly was carrying out the mandate of the Indiana
                    Constitution of 1816 that these fines be used to finance schools.</p>
            <p>In 1825 the General Assembly transferred the financial and administrative control of the seminary to
                    a single trustee appointed by the county commissioners.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> In 1828, an act

                    </placeName> Seminary were in operation at the same time. While the available records do indicate
                    that there was a certain amount of overlapping of individual memberships on the three boards, they
                    do not make clear the exact jurisdiction of each board over the school programs, the building, or
                    the public funds allocated for education and maintenance.</p>
            <p>It is particularly difficult to determine the relationship between the boards and the various schools
                    conducted in the university building between 1828 and 1842. It is clear, however, that the <hi rend="i">seminary</hi> and university boards granted permission to individuals to set up private
                    schools in the building. And it is also clear that the <hi rend="i">academy</hi> and university
                    boards each set up and financed the operation of some kind of school program. Regardless, though, of
                    how the schools were financed and who administered them, with only brief exceptions the building
                    housed throughout the period a broad school program for boys and girls of all ages. In a period when
                    academic curricula were still largely unstructured and tuition-attracting courses were of first
                    importance (especially to teachers whose income was usually solely dependent thereon), the scope, if
                    not the depth, of the educational programs was impressive. Thus, several of the teachers hired or
                    granted use of the building by the boards offered the "elementary branches of Geography,
                    Grammar, Arithmetic and Writing," plus "all the English branches," such
                    as composition and rhetoric, and Latin and Greek. In other instances something approaching the
                    modern elementary, secondary, and higher education categories of instruction can be identified. One
                    school conducted in the late 1820's by a teacher and two assistants offered only the
                    "elementary branches" to the hundred boys and girls who attended. On the other
                    hand, the curricula of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> Academy in the 1830's and of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University Grammar School and <placeName>

                    </placeName> University Preparatory Department in the 1840's were for more advanced
                    students, containing as they did the ancient and modern languages, mathematics, and moral and
                    natural philosophy for college preparatory students as well as "mercantile and
                    practical" subjects—surveying, accounting, etc.—for terminal
                    students. But the closest to a college-level program during the period was that provided by the
                    ambitious but short-lived <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University Medical College in 1837-1838.</p>
            <pb n="326" id="VAA4025-059-4-038"/>
            <p>A pressing—and perennial—problem that faced the newly-elected seminary board of
                    trustees in 1828 was the need to secure funds for the operation of an educational program. The board
                    explored the possibilities of recovering money allegedly misappropriated by an earlier trustee and
                    of compelling the local courts and justices of the peace to turn over the penal fines dedicated for
                    education. Later, the university board would continue to struggle with finances, putting pressure on
                    the borough of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to share the proceeds from the sale of the commons land as authorized by Congress<hi rend="sup">9</hi> and deciding in the late 1830's to lease or sell the university
                    building to provide needed operating funds.</p>
            <p>But such essentially financial problems were not the only ones to be solved by the various boards:
                    the building had to be maintained, teachers and students encouraged to use facilities and programs,
                    and the boards themselves needed to be kept intact. The last, which had frequently been a problem
                    before 1824, was later aggravated by the frequent changes in the university's legal status.
                    Moreover, by the 1830's a number of additional voluntary associations had made their
                    appearance in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> area to compete with the boards of trustees for the time and energies of men with
                    cultural interests; among these were the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> Library Company and the Historical and Antiquarian, Thespian, and Temperance societies.
                    Similarly the competition for students and teachers became increasingly keen as the number of
                    sectarian and other private schools grew and the "free school" movement gained
                    adherents.</p>
            <p>Despite the many legal, financial, academic, and personnel problems it faced, the university board of
                    trustees during the period of these minutes—and particularly after the reestablishment of
                    its corporate identity in 1838—made gains in a number of areas by 1842: its debts were
                    paid and prospects for additional income were brighter; a lot had been acquired and the possibility
                    of a new building was being discussed; a continuing educational program under the direction of the
                    board was again available and plans for expansion were under consideration.</p>

                            followed, and, with some exceptions, original punctuation has been retained. Periods have
                            been added after abbreviations and initials of persons; they have also been used at the ends
                            of paragraphs. Decimal points have been added. Commas have been inserted only to separate
                            series of words and phrases. The abbreviations "A.M.,"
                            "P.M.," "A.D.," etc., have been standardized by uniform
                            use of capital letters and periods. At times dollars and cents are written with fractions
                            instead of decimal points; wherever this occurs, the fraction has been converted to a
                            decimal, as: $137 72 1/4/100 became $137.72 1/4. A colon has been used

                            added occasionally where its use was clearly indicated. Quotations and parentheses have not
                            been closed if they were unclosed in the original. Superior letters have been brought down
                            to the line; unintentional repetitions have been omitted. Space limitations have prompted
                            the listing of members present and the recording of votes in series instead of the columns
                            which often appear in the original. Inconsistent or unusual spacing used in the original
                            minutes has dictated some modification of spacing and paragraphing for the sake of clarity

            <p>Mr. Decker from the committee which was appointed to examine the claim &amp; Account of Thomas
                    Bishop for work done, and materials furnished for the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName> seminary building, now made the foll[ow]ing written report, i.e.:</p>
            <p>"That on examination it is found that he, (T. Bishop) was employed by the former Trustees of
                    the institution, to make such repairs as were believed necessary at the time, to secure the same
                    from the weather and consequent destruction; and to fit up some of the rooms for the accommodation
                    of a school. His bill for such repairs &amp; materials, amounts to
                    $320.34—and the sum of $243.50, has been paid by voluntary
                    subscription by the Citizens; leaving a balance of $76.84. And a balance is found on the
                    subscription papers of $19.50, to wit:</p>
            <p rend="center">A. Massey $10.00, G. R. C. Sullivan $5.00, Thos. Baird
                    $2.00,E.Stout $2.00, and W. A. Twigg $50. = $19.50.</p>
            <p>A finall part of A. Massey's subscription appears to have been paid in hauling materials
                    &amp;c. deducting this amount it will leave a balance unpaid of $57.34. The
                    Account for work is believed to be high; but as the work cannot be valued at this late period, and
                    as it was superintended by One of the Trustees in person, and the said Account made out and said <pb n="333" id="VAA4025-059-4-045"/> charges received by the said trustees, together with the
                    consideration of a large portion of it having been paid by the subscriptions above mentioned; it is
                    recommended by the Committee to receive the Account, and pay the balance of $76.84 Cents,
                    out of the funds of the institution."</p>
            <p>Which report being read on Motion, the same was concurred in, and Ordered to be recorded.</p>
            <p>In conformity wherewith, It is Ordered that the said Thomas Bishop be allowed the said sum of seventy
                    six dollars &amp; eighty four cents, in full of his demand; and that the same be paid him by
                    the Treasurer out of any funds in his hands not otherwise appropriated.</p>
            <p>Ordered further, That the Treasurer immediately proceed, and if practicable collect from the several
                    persons reported above to be in arrears for the subscriptions made by them, and appearing on the
                    different subscription papers.</p>
            <p>Ordered, that the board do now adjourn.</p>

            <p>May 19th 1829. G. W. Johnston Secry. B. T. K. C. Semy".</p>
            <p>Which was partially answer'd by the following Memo. on the back, i.e.:</p>
            <p rend="center">"Bond dated 17 June 1819, penalty $2000.</p>
            <p rend="center">Danl. McClure &amp; Saml. Thompson Securities.</p>
            <p rend="center">This is the only bond on file."</p>
            <p>Your Reporter delayed until the 21st for answer from Mr. Ewing—When he waited upon him
                    personally at his Office, and by his ready &amp; polite assistance examined the Books of the
                    Vinc[enne]s Bank, from which it appears 1st That on the 25th Mar. 1819 Mr. Scott received a Credit
                    under the item of Cash, (see Ledger pa. 272.) of $275.45. The precise amount of Mr.
                    Badollet's check—and upon the 29th Apl. 1819 he was charged with Cash
                    $275.45. It appears 2ndly by the Minutes of the Bank Directors that the last sitting at
                    which Mr. Scott attended, was on the 16th Mar. 1820, (nearly 13 months after Mr. Badollet's
                    check!)— and the <hi rend="i">resignation</hi> of other Directors is noticed upon the
                    Minutes, yet no mention is made of Mr. Scott's withdrawing, (therefore its presumed he
                    remained a Director until the Bank failed.) And upon the 19 Decr. 1820 a Motion to suspend specie
                    payments was negatived by the Directory, (which brings into full operation the statement of Mr. Hay,
                    that the Bank stopped payment in 1821.) As to the third Query put to Mr. Ewing, he verbally states,
                    that Mr. Scott never got any <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> Bank or Branch paper from him. That any further answer he does not feel himself
                    authorised to give, having been the Attorney for Mr. Scott in his life time, and now for his Admors.
                    Mr. Scott's A/c with the Bank (see Led. pa. 506.) closes on the 28th July 1822, by a Credit
                    of Cash. And what is somewhat remarkable &amp; giving rise to considerable suspicion is, that
                    Mr. Scott is charged on the 9th Jany. 1822, with "bills received"
                    $200.00 [Why take Notes on bills upon a broken bank?!].<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No answer has yet been received to the other Notes &amp; letter; Nor is it deem'd
                    essential, for 1st as to the Sheriff's they were not authorised by law to receive paper in
                    payment of fines; and of course Mr. Scott not justifiable in receiving it from them. 2ndly As to the

            <p>Secondly, as to the law.</p>
            <p>Not conceiving it necessary to go beyond the adoption of our State Constitution, for by the 4th
                    proposition in the Act of Congress, upon which our Constitution is based, the Seminary Township in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson County</region>
                    </placeName>, and of course the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, which grew out of and depended upon the grant by Congress of that Township
                    of land, was placed at the disposal of the state; therefore the first Act of our Legislature which
                    demands our attention, is that contained in the Rev. Code of 1818 pa. 355, (No. 1.), by the
                    provisions of which the Governor was to appoint a Trustee for the public Seminary in each County;
                    who was to enter into bond, which should be transmitted by the Clerk of the Cir. Co. to the
                    Secretary of State; and then receive all monies etc. properly appertaining to the seminary, such as
                    Fines &amp;c., and that he should make an annual report to the Legislature, by way of <hi rend="i">List</hi> of all monies received by him.</p>
            <p>By the Act (No. 2) of 1819 pa. 67. It was made the duty of the Trustee to loan out the monies which
                    should come to his hands, at an Interest of 6 pr. centm. pr. an. if an opportunity could be
                    had".</p>
            <p>By the Act (No. 3.) of the 3d [2d] Jany. 1822 pa. 124 It was provided, (as a substitute its presumed
                    for the report required by the Act of 1818) that the Trustee should make an annual &amp;
                    detailed state [ment] of the funds in his hands, to the Board of County Commissioners, on the 2d day
                    of their November sessions.</p>
            <p>In the special Acts (No. 4.) of 1824, pa. 107, the "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University" was re-baptised &amp; transfer'd to the "<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName> Seminary", and all monies in the former Trustees hands were to be paid over to
                    the <hi rend="i">Treasurer</hi> of the board, or otherwise actually to the Trustee of the County
                    Seminary (see 4th sec of the Act (No. 5.) to regulate County seminaries, Ap[proved] 31 Jany. 1824.
                    R. C. '24 pa. 116.). In addition to this construction, the Act of 1825 pa. 96. (No. 6),
                    applies the general Act to the special case of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox County</region>
                    </placeName> Seminary.</p>
            <p>By the 2d Sec. of the Act of 1824 pa. 116 (No. 5.) a Trustee in each County was to be
                    appointed—he was to give Bond, and take on Oath—receive monies &amp;c.
                    from his predecessor—make statements thereof to the Board of County Commissioners
                    &amp; to the Legislature—and to <hi rend="i">loan</hi> out monies.</p>
            <pb n="341" id="VAA4025-059-4-053"/>
            <p>By the 13th sec. of the same Act, a Trustee for each Township in the County <hi rend="i">might</hi>
                    be elected. And by the Act (No. 7.) of 1828 pa. 121, five Trustees should be elected in the County,
                    with power to appoint Officers, such as Treasurer &amp; Secretary—and to demand
                    &amp; receive all monies &amp;c. belonging to the Seminary.</p>
            <p>Now Upon applying the law of the case to the above statement of facts, it follows that the estate of
                    Mr. Scott &amp; his securities, are liable for the whole amount of the paper nominally paid
                    over by him, and now in the hands of your Treasurer; for the following reasons, i.e.:</p>
            <p>1st The Act of 1818, (No. 1.) made it incumbent upon him to report to the Legislature; and by the
                    terms of his bond he was bound to comply with the law—and in February 1819 he received
                    $275.45; and in September '19, $14, which he should have reported to
                    the Legislature at its December session 1819—But 2d again he should have reported to the
                    Board of County commissioners, (See Act of Jany. 1822 (No. 3.) at their November sessions, (at which
                    time the whole sum had came [sic] to his hands) this he failed to do [therefore its presumed he made
                    no report to the Legislature in 1819 or 1820.]<hi rend="sup">25</hi> as appears by the records of
                    the Commissioners; consequently his Bond became forfeited—3d The <hi rend="i">paper</hi>,
                    if ever actually received &amp; kept by him, was so received in his <hi rend="i">own
                    wrong;</hi> For by the 3d Sec. of the 9th Art. of our Constitution [Indiana, 18161, the term money
                    is used as being the medium of which the seminary funds should be composed, arising from Fines. And
                    its believed that nothing can be considered as money but such currency as is made by law a legal
                    tender; and under the Acts of Congress nothing is such but Gold or Silver. And the Joint Resolutions
                    of the 16th Decemr. 1818 (Acts 1819 pa. 142,) and that of 22d Jany. 1820, (Acts '20, pa.
                    159,) do not help out the Trustee, or justify him in receiving <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> bank or Branch paper; for those Resolutions have a direct application to State
                    &amp; County Taxes, and to such objects only. 4th Mr. Badollet's Check was
                    considered by Mr. Scott as <hi rend="i">specie;</hi> for one month after its being drawn, he either
                    received Cash for it, or had it placed to his credit as cash; and about a month afterwards drew the
                    same amount from the Bank in Cash. This then was a Cash transaction, Otherwise the term Bills would
                    have been used, as was done in closing his Account. Interest should be added to the amount received,
                    by way of damages, <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">25</hi> Brackets are in original.</item>
               </list>
                    <pb n="342" id="VAA4025-059-4-054"/> provided that it can be proved that he "had an
                    Opportunity" to <hi rend="i">loan out</hi> the money and failed to embrace it.</p>
            <p>At all events, in strict equity, he is liable for the sum of $289.45 the amount by his own
                    shewing which came to his hands in February &amp; September 1819, for the following reasons,
                    1st: He was bound to report as above stated, which he failed to do. 2d: He being a Director of the
                    Bank, of course cognizant of its affairs, should have Cashed Mr. Badollet's check, and the
                        <hi rend="i">paper</hi> received from Beckes, previous to the failure of the Bank in
                    1821.—and the whole transaction shews clearly that the receipt of the paper by Harrison
                    from Scott was conditionally. Interest upon the sum of $289.45 should be added from
                    December 1819, when he should have reported, to August 1826, when he settled with Mr. Harrison:
                    indeed, strictly speaking, Mr. Scott should be liable for Interest until the sum is paid in good
                    money; for it is a matter of public notoriety that said Bank paper is now entirely worthless.</p>
            <p>Your reporter therefore, would recommend the adoption of the following resolutions, i.e.:</p>
            <p>"Resolved, that the above report now made by G. W. Johnston, be concurred in and recorded.
                    And that our Secretary take immediate steps to obtain, at the expense of this institution, a

                    in the seminary, report, that they have had the subject refer'd to them, under
                    consideration, and in due time the aforesaid School Masters did so divide the appartments of the
                    house to suit their own convenience, and as [has?] met the approbation of the Committee. They have
                    both signed a written Article of Agreement, and deposited the same with the Chairman of the Board.</p>
            <p>The Committee have had the large room upstairs finished with two good coats of

                    Walls repaired, which the Committee thought most adviseable and expedient. The Committee have
                    permitted Mr. J. N. Allen to cause to have finished the large room down stairs, at his own expense,
                    under the immediate direction of the Committee, and on as cheap terms as the Committee themselves
                    could have done, which is now finished with two good coats of plastering, together with Glass and

            <p>On the other side should the Seminary or Academy instead of the University make the appointments then
                    they must do so without authority; and the professors would not be acting under the University
                    Charter which alone authorises the appointment of such Professors—as it is of importence
                    to the Town &amp; Country, that the Professors of Medicine should have ample powers

                    management of any Seminary of learning, but more especially of one, where there are no

                    responsible as he is to the Trustees and the Publick for its administration, it would seem to your
                    Committee, that he should have the power of selecting and dismissing his assistants-as he deemed

                    this Institution one of the most valuable and important Seminaries of learning in the

                    a Building and the obtaining of materials for erecting the same—The location is a matter
                    of much importance, it should be as nearly central as possible, and of a size to authorize any
                    future additions to the building that may be required, besides furnishing ample room for play
                    ground.—It is hoped the Trustees will see the propriety of an immediate action on this

            <p>This volume is the sixth in the Indiana Historical Bureau's series of "messages and
                    papers" of Indiana's territorial and state governors. Companion volumes in the
                    series cover a broader time-span, but the importance of the critical era subsequent to the Panic of
                    1837 undoubtedly justifies the editor's decision to confine the coverage here to the single
                    three-year term of Governor Wallace.</p>
            <p>The volume contains basic executive documents reflecting Indiana's efforts to cope with its
                    responsibilities in carrying out the "mammoth" internal improvements program
                    authorized by the 1836 General Assembly. Included are such significant papers as the
                    governor's annual addresses to the legislature and the regular reports of three key
                    agencies—the Internal Improvements Board, the Fund Commissioners, and the State Bank.
                    These and similar documents have been ferreted from the extensive collection of official papers (<hi rend="i">Senate Journals, House Journals, Laws of Indiana</hi>, etc.) which are in the Indiana
                    State Library. The practical value of a compilation of this type is obvious to the student who has
                    attempted to make his way through the parent collection. The editor's
                    footnotes—though sometimes more lengthy than the sources they are designed to
                    interpret—are a vital part of the documentary presentation.</p>
            <p>It is conceded that a book of governmental documents such as this will have a limited reading
                    audience. Yet, a systematic perusal of its 501 pages will expose the reader to the kind of subtle,
                    authentic drama that only "nearness" to historical events can bring. The plot is
                    simple: how was Indiana to maintain financial solvency in the midst of the stringent fiscal cutback
                    which followed the great Panic? The "Prologue" of the drama was staged back in the
                    late 1820's when state officials became imbued with a multitude of panaceas to cope with
                    the region's transportation problems. "Act I" saw the General Assembly,
                    prompted by the prevailing optimism of the day, commit Hoosiers to a comprehensive internal
                    improvements plan which in retrospect was well beyond their means. The Wallace volume contains the
                    theme of "Act II": the confrontation with reality and the groping for methods to
                    resolve a long chain of financial dilemmas. "Act III," in which the protagonists
                    eventually prevail over adverse circumstances and rise from the melee with a chastened outlook on
                    the facts of economic life, stretches out for more than a decade beyond the official tenure of
                    Governor Wallace.</p>
            <p>As the editor implies (pp. 47-49), this is not a drama in which great heroes have been cast. Even
                    Governor Wallace, who was in a position to play a starring role, seems to prefer the dimmer portions
                    of the stage. A host of secondary figures—Samuel Merrill, Nathan <pb n="390" id="VAA4025-059-4-102"/> Palmer, Lucius Scott, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>

                    Williams, Samuel Hanna, Calvin Fletcher, Samuel Lewis—flit back and forth without
                    appreciably altering the course of events. Actually, it seems that it is the
                    "Fates," personified by the Morris Canal and Banking Company, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> Rothschilds, and the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Belmonts, who are harbingers of the action. And clearly the real villain in the whole
                    episode is the depression which began to creep over the nation following the inauguration of
                    President Martin Van Buren.</p>
            <p>It is easy to criticize Governor Wallace and other officials of this era for their actions, or lack
                    of action, in forestalling the bankruptcy which threatened the state from a dozen different
                    directions. But, again, a careful reading of their formal arguments has a tendency to gain support
                    for their efforts. Granted that Indiana's leaders at this time were not Lincolns, Clays,
                    and Jacksons, it would be a mistake to dismiss them lightly. They were "good"
                    frontier people—adroit politicians, respectable administrators, and self-trained experts
                    in the arts of communication. They should not be indicted for failure to comprehend all of the
                    intricacies of "high finance" into which the attempted expansion of their
                    state's facilities inevitably led them.</p>

            <p>Dr. Rudolph, of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Presbyterian Theological Seminary, presents the story of Presbyterianism in Indiana in
                    the first half of the nineteenth century as a struggle between Yankees and Hoosiers. The Yankees
                    were well-educated Presbyterian ministers from New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and the middle Atlantic states who, hearing of "the mud and illiteracy and
                    grossness of the frontier … felt the call … to do something about
                    it," and came west to build a "Hoosier Zion-a segment of the kingdom of
                    God" (pp. 47-48).</p>
            <p>He has used a wide variety of sources, many in manuscript, including minutes of church sessions,
                    presbyteries, and synods, and especially valuable reports made to the American Home Missionary
                    Society. Judicious use has been made of contemporary books by Presbyterian ministers Isaac Reed,
                    Baynard Hall, and John M. Dickey; of later church historians such as Sweet and Edson; of such
                    writers on early Indiana as Esarey and Buley; and of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                    History.</hi> Quotations from contemporary writers enrich the text, notably Hall's spicy
                    comments; some quotations from secondary writers might have been abridged.</p>
            <p>Not strictly chronological, the book treats in turn "The Settlers,''
                    "The Preachers," "The Churches," and "The
                    Teaching." The preachers were sent by the General Assembly and various missionary
                    societies, especially the American Home Missionary Society in which Congregationalists cooperated
                    with Presbyterians. Methodist and Baptist workers, already on the ground when the Presbyterians
                    arrived, through the homespun oratory of their lay preachers and the excitement of their <pb n="391" id="VAA4025-059-4-103"/> camp meetings, continued their hold on Hoosiers, particularly on those
                    of southern extraction.</p>
            <p>The eastern preachers seemed "exotic" and "too rationalistic," as
                    "they kept answering questions the frontiersmen were not asking," so that
                    "Calvin never had it so hard in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Geneva</settlement>
                    </placeName> as some of the Presbyterian ministers had it in Indiana" (pp. 49, 149).
                    Difficulties in financing church buildings and ministers' salaries led Hall to suggest the
                    formation of "The-make-congregations-pay-what-they-voluntarily-promise Society"
                    (p. 61). The unfortunate break between Old School and New School Presbyterians augmented the
                    difficulties.</p>
            <p>In spite of all, Presbyterianism flourished. By 1850 its churches numbered two hundred eighty-two,
                    about one fourth the combined total of Methodist and Baptist churches. Supplementing the Sunday
                    services, frequent "sacramental occasions," with sermons and communion services,
                    lasted from Fridays to Mondays, often overflowing into the woods. Social reforms were advocated, the
                    New School especially urging strong antislavery measures. Presbyterian ministers assumed leadership
                    in interdenominational Sunday schools, and many conducted private schools. The Rev. Caleb Mills of
                    Wabash College worked vigorously for free public schools. Numerous secondary schools were
                    established. The first teachers in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University and Indiana State Seminary (later Indiana University) were Presbyterian
                    ministers. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> College was established by the Indiana Synod, and Wabash College by a group of
                    Presbyterians. As the climax of the educational system, an Indiana Theological Seminary was founded
                    in 1829, but succumbed in 1857.</p>
            <p>Rudolph has pointed out clearly the important contributions to the young Hoosier state that the
                    Presbyterians made by setting high standards in intellectual as well as religious fields.</p>

                    $6.60.)</head>
            <p>This is a splendid account of the naval engagements fought on Lake Champlain and Lake George. The
                    author has produced a narrative distinguished for its charming style, its vividness, and its
                    accuracy. His experienced, well-placed, and concise phrasing guarantees for the reader the high
                    degree of readability found only in historians who write with deliberate care and understanding of
                    the kinetics of the language. It is heartening to find more and more historians abandoning the
                    obfuscous and colorless academic style—which all too often wearies before it
                    imparts—for one which, by the use of well-researched details, creates for the reader an
                    historical picture full of living and fascinating characters.</p>
            <p>The narrative begins with François de Pontgravè, diplomat and trader, and his
                    lieutenant, Samuel de Champlain, who, beginning in 1603, led exploring expeditions on the St.
                    Lawrence River and the lakes, trading with the Algonquins and fighting with them against the
                    Iroquois, their mutual enemies. The book ends with Captain Thomas Macdonough's great naval
                    victory at Plattsburg in 1814. One of the <pb n="392" id="VAA4025-059-4-104"/> most vivid chapters
                    of the book describes the Rangers of Robert Rogers, that "moth with the claws of an
                    eagle," who, fighting Frenchmen and Indians on both sides of the lakes, "flitted
                    everywhere around the dying flame of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>" (p. 63). Equally dramatic are the ensuing chapters on the French and Indian
                    War, during which Sir Jeffrey Amherst, assisted by Rogers Rangers in whaleboats, seized Ticonderoga
                    with its great military supplies. The incredible Rangers also contributed to the fall of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Montreal</settlement>
                    </placeName> which, following Wolfe's victory on the Plains of Abraham, yielded all <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> to the British and hastened the end of the war.</p>
            <p>One of the outstanding feaures of this book is the skill with which the author has drawn his
                    character portraits. As the book progresses from the French and Indian War to the American
                    Revolution, we encounter Ethan Allen who, possessed of a stentorian voice and dressed in a green
                    uniform coat equipped with fancy epaulettes, advanced with eighty-three men and with the assistance
                    of Benedict Arnold against Ticonderoga, which yielded with its great stores of cannon. The author
                    reaches the height of his narratives as he describes how Arnold in council with his superiors
                    suggested that they should build light, small, narrow vessels which could be fast under sail and,
                    more important, would command great maneuverability in the narrow lakes. With such a fleet, built at
                    Skenesborough, Arnold in August, 1776, set out against the British fleet on the lakes; but his
                    impetuosity led him to defeat, though he and his men fought bravely. All this is told in resplendent
                    prose, as is Bourgoyne's journey from <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> to Lake Champlain, where he forced the Americans to abandon Ticonderoga and Mount
                    Independence. But perhaps the most beautiful passages in the book are those which describe the lakes
                    and the Green Mountains as Captain Thomas Macdonough built his famous frigate, <hi rend="i">Saratoga</hi>, which in September, 1814, helped him win the Battle of Plattsburg. The British
                    commander, Prevost, finding his communications with his base cut and believing that his position was
                    untenable, hastily retreated to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The author concludes his book with an interesting essay on the kinds of boats that participated in
                    the battles, including the bark canoes, the radeaux, the row galleys, the gondolas, and the capital
                    ships and gunboats.</p>
            <p>The book is based on printed sources and secondary works; the inclusion of manuscript materials would
                    have greatly increased its importance. Many scholars will be skeptical of the reliability of the
                    book because of the author's failure to provide footnotes to the sources he has used.</p>

                    expressed in his own mid-twentieth-century messages from the banks of the <pb n="393" id="VAA4025-059-4-105"/> Missouri River to friends left behind in Indiana. Although in his
                    letters the Chinese pheasant replaces the buffalo described by the explorers, the sky remains clear,
                    the river long, the plains wide, and the mountains tall.</p>
            <p>The letters and related documents cover a period of seventy years. Earliest in time is Thomas
                    Jefferson's pessimistic inquiry of 1783 to George Rogers Clark as to whether the latter
                    would be interested in leading a party to explore the country "from the Mississippi to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>"; the latest is an 1854 affidavit of Patrick Gass, survivor of the famous
                    exploration. Research students, Lewis and Clark buffs, and present inhabitants of the country
                    described will find here worthwhile supplements to the much-perused journals of the expedition.
                    Realizing that letters from the frontier were usually published in the eastern newspapers, their
                    writers often included more narrative, detail, and explanation than one might expect to find in
                    private correspondence. The editorial notes are well done and should be helpful to all types of
                    readers.</p>
            <p>Four values to be obtained from a patient reading of these papers should be mentioned. First, a
                    scattering of new information is provided in such special fields as financing. Second, the larger
                    purpose of the journey becomes even more apparent from the letters than from the
                    expedition's journals. It is clear that the sponsors envisioned far more than a mere
                    exploration of the area recently purchased from <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>; they were interested in the lands to the west of that area, as well. A third fruit of
                    these letters is an increased realization of the prime role of President Jefferson in the
                    expedition. Finally, this collection brings out clearly the cordial relationship between Lewis and
                    Clark which survived all temptations toward disharmony.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History: A Reinterpretation.</hi> By
                    Frederick Merk. (<placeName>

            <p>Historians have long differed over the meaning, the significance, and even the existence of the
                    American phenomenon of expansion called Manifest Destiny. Since the concept of Manifest Destiny did
                    encompass the acquisition of territory by conquest, some critics have called it aggression under the
                    guise of pious sentiment, or merely an American form of imperialism. Some sensitive historians have
                    defended the doctrine, saying that American expansion despoiled no one unjustly. Samuel F. Bemis,
                    for example, has called it "Manifest Opportunity." Not long ago, on the other
                    hand, N#2 A. Graebner, in his book <hi rend="i">Empire on the Pacific</hi> (1955), virtually denied
                    the existence of Manifest Destiny as a calculated expansionist movement. Now Frederick Merk,
                    professor emeritus of American history, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, has come along with a reinterpretation not only of Manifest Destiny-which
                    he insists was a force that existed in American politics with believers in every section of the
                    nation and in all levels of intelligence-but also of scholarly opinion regarding various aspects of
                    American expansionism in the nineteenth century.</p>
            <pb n="394" id="VAA4025-059-4-106"/>
            <p>Basing his analysis on a wide use of newspaper editorials, speeches in the Congress, and campaign
                    oratory, and also on diaries and private correspondence, Merk calls this a study in public opinion.
                    He admits that his tools of measurement may not be precise but maintains that they are nonetheless
                    valid for his purpose—the study of expansionist agitation. Even though the expansionist
                    fervor of the 1890's is analyzed, most of the book deals with the period of the
                    1840's, the era to which the author has devoted many years of his scholarly career.</p>
            <p>As might be expected from a mature scholar dealing with the area of his acknowledged competence, this
                    book bristles with shrewd insights, revisions of past interpretations, and provocative new
                    interpretations. Merk's views are woven into two main themes: the desire of some
                    expansionists to extend the nation's boundaries over the entire North American continent,
                    particularly during the 1840's, and the relationship of this expansionist agitation to the
                    surge to the Pacific. In the era of James K. Polk, in fact, Merk sees two levels of expansionist
                    agitation, that which sought the entire continent and that which wanted only a shoreline on the
                    Pacific. He admits, however, that in this period Manifest Destiny meant expansion ordained by heaven
                    over an area not clearly defined, hence the latitude for the varying interpretations of this
                    doctrine.</p>
            <p>The author contends that since slogans serve politicians, historians should not slight them. As a
                    slogan, he says, Manifest Destiny served Polk well. It was a factor in the territorial advance to
                    the Pacific. Merk also points out that Manifest Destiny was the product of many forces, and
                    challenges the view that it was an expression of nationalism. The era of the 1840's, he
                    asserts, exhibited little nationalism. Powerful among the forces comprising Manifest Destiny, he
                    maintains, was the doctrine of states' rights, for which expansionists had a strong taste.
                    Because Manifest Destiny did not reflect the national spirit, it gained little support, even at the
                    outset. It never acquired national, sectional, or party following commensurate with its bigness.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Merk recognizes nationalism as an element in the New Manifest Destiny, which he
                    calls the imperialism of the 1890's. He argues that this imperialism was not merely a
                    variant of the ideology of the 1840's; indeed, the expansionism of the 1890's was
                    the antithesis of Manifest Destiny. The expansionism of the 1890's was insular,
                    imperialistic, and involved the acquisition of colonial subjects. In the 1840's
                    expansionism was continental and offered the conquered the equality implicit in statehood. According
                    to this thesis, "Manifest Destiny and imperialism were traps into which the nation was led
                    in 1846 and in 1899, and from which it extricated itself as well as it could afterward" (p.
                    261).</p>
            <p>In Merk's view—his major thesis in fact—a truer expression of the
                    national spirit was the concept of America's Mission. This ideal of Mission, meaning that
                    America was the light of liberty for Europe, indeed for the world, was present from the beginning of
                    American history and still lives, whereas Manifest Destiny expired at the end of the nineteenth
                    century. Although this sense of Mission to redeem the Old World by setting a high example of freedom
                    in the New was idealistic and Manifest Destiny seemed selfish, the two concepts were linked in the
                    nineteenth century. If Manifest Destiny were fulfilled and American freedom spread itself over the
                    entire continent, then the <pb n="395" id="VAA4025-059-4-107"/> light of liberty would be a brighter
                    guide than ever for the peoples of the Old World. Mission, it is claimed, later broke the link and
                    even curbed the crusading, aggressive expansionism of Manifest Destiny.</p>
            <p>However one looks at it, this is an important book. Its ideas, whether or not one accepts them, are
                    challenging. Despite the many excellent features in this study and regardless of the explanation in
                    the preface, one questions the wisdom of even so capable a historian as Professor Merk in placing
                    long undigested quotations from his sources throughout the narrative. One wonders, too, why he chose
                    to overlook the writings of Professor Graebner which bear directly on this subject. Nonetheless, all
                    students of history, and particularly those interested in the development of national character and
                    the ideas of American diplomacy, should be grateful to Professor Merk for bringing together the
                    thinking and scholarship of many years in this fine volume. He has given us what may now be
                    considered the major interpretive work on the subject.</p>

            <p>In almost every important respect <hi rend="i">The Tolerant Populists</hi> is an ideal monograph. The
                    author has brought his problem into a sharp focus and has stated it clearly. In addition to using a
                    broad range of manuscript, pamphlet, and archival source materials, he has sought "to
                    sample newspapers representing every area, faction, ethnic group, or special viewpoint, if it
                    existed in print, that related to the problem of Populism and nativism or immigrants in any
                    significant way" (p. 246). Finally, he has stated his conclusions clearly and has confined
                    them to the limits of his study and his materials.</p>
            <p>The sharp focus of the book is made clear in the opening sentence of the Preface. It was to
                    investigate "the attitudes of the Populists of Kansas to foreign-born people and to foreign
                    groups and institutions" and "the participation of the foreign-born in the
                    People's or Populist party in Kansas from about 1888 to about 1900." In concluding
                    an analysis of the view of Populism presented in Richard Hofstadter's Age of Reform with
                    the assertion that a corrective is needed, the author contents himself with the hope that his book
                    is Ira step in the right direction." Again, at the conclusion of an historiographical
                    summary that is almost certain to find a place on required reading lists, the limited scope and
                    sharp focus of the study are adumbrated. It is the Kansas Populists that are being studied. The
                    results of the study "apply only to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>."</p>
            <p>The point of departure for the analysis of the available material is a condensation of what
                    historians, behaviorial scientists, and social critics have written about the Populists. Among
                    others, the names of Lee J. Levinger, Carey Mc Williams, Humphrey J. Desmond, Barbara Miller
                    Solomon, Victor C. Ferkis, Edward A. Shils, and Peter Viereck appear in the text or in the
                    footnotes. More familiar to historians among the recent critics of Populism are Max Lerner, Oscar
                    Handlin, and Richard Hofstadter. The revisers of the revisionists whose articles <pb n="396" id="VAA4025-059-4-108"/> receive some attention include <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Norman</settlement>
                    </placeName> Pollack, C. Vann Woodward, and John Higham. To compress the interpretations of so many
                    and so diverse scholars is a major feat worthy of explicit recognition and is indicative of the
                    growing familiarity of younger historians with the vocabulary and methodology of students in other
                    disciplines.</p>
            <p>Two distillations of the charges levelled at the Populists that appear in widely separated parts of
                    the book may be used to indicate more specifically the problem that Nugent sought to solve. He
                    asserts that on the negative side of the ledger Hofstadter presented the Populists as
                    "conspiracy-minded, nativists, chauvinists and jingoes, anti-Semites, part of a long-time
                    'undercurrent of provincial resentments,' founders of a legacy of virulence, part
                    of a credulous age but more credulous and vicious than their contemporaries, rebellious, suspicious,
                    irrational" (p. 18). In the concluding chapter the criticisms are reduced to five principal
                    ones. "The Populists have been accused of nativism …
                    'conspiracy-mindedness' … anti-Semitism … chauvinism
                    … [and] of selling out their vaunted reform principles" (p. 231). Sandwiched
                    between these summaries the reader will find a meticulous analysis of the Kansas elections during
                    the period 1888-1900. The methodology that is used results in some repetition, but the conclusions
                    are clear. The Kansas Populists are found "not guilty" on all counts in the
                    indictment. Indeed, they appear in a somewhat more favorable light than their contemporaries of
                    other political persuasions. "They were bound together not by common neuroses but by
                    … common democratic and humanitarian ideals, and common wrath at the infringement of
                    them" (p. 242). The Populists of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> "were people who were seeking the solution of concrete economic distress
                    through the instrumentality of a political party" (p. 243).</p>
            <p>In presenting his findings the author stresses the importance of money, land, and transportation
                    problems; depicts the interacting roles of the prohibition and women's suffrage questions;
                    provides a plethora of documentation; indulges in some polysyllabic pyrotechnics; and falls into an
                    occasional error. For example there was no United Lutheran Church of America in the 1880's
                    (p. 68). Finally, the constructive contributions of the book go far beyond the answers to specific
                    questions and assure for it a significant place in the historical literature of Kansas and of
                    Populism.</p>

            <p>Mr. Davis introduces his work by remarking that "the closing decades of the nineteenth
                    century saw a strange duality in international affairs, for the great powers of the world prepared
                    for war at the same time that they talked ardently about peace" (p. 1). In American foreign
                    relations, the author believes, these two themes came to focus in the First Hague Peace Conference
                    of 1899.</p>
            <pb n="397" id="VAA4025-059-4-109"/>
            <p>After setting the scene and discussing the tsar's rescript of August 24, 1898, which
                    proposed the international conference, the author centers on the American delegation, both official
                    and unofficial. Particularly well done is his treatment of the unofficial American delegates. The
                    personalities of the American Peace Society, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and
                    other American peace organizations, who combined with the European pacifists such as the Baroness
                    Bertha von Suttner, Dr. W. Evans Darby, and W. T. Stead to put pressure on the conference, almost
                    come to life. Also well done are the sketches of the American delegates to the conference. The
                    portrayals of Andrew D. White, Captain Alfred T. Mahan, Seth Low, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Stanford</settlement>
                    </placeName> Newel, and Captain William R. Crozier are masterful. But it is Frederick W. Holls,
                    secretary of the American delegation, on whom the author calls to supply the drama of the narrative.
                    Mr. Davis describes the trip of Holls and Philipp Zorn of the <placeName>

            <p>No nation in 1899 was willing to limit armaments, proof for the author of the hypocrisy of many
                    governments, and no general agreement could be reached against use of projectiles thrown from
                    balloons, asphyxiating gas, and unnecessarily cruel bullets. There was still the arbitration court.
                    But Mahan's insistence on traditional American isolationism brought a declaration that
                    American signature of the arbitration convention was not a departure from traditional policies. Mr.
                    Davis believes this proviso weakened the Permanent Court of Arbitration.</p>
            <p>The author finally states that "while one can trace international judicial developments from
                    the First Hague Peace Conference to the present International Court of Justice and believe that the
                    conference of 1899 did mark the beginning of considerable progress, one must conclude that the
                    conference was essentially a failure" (p. 212). In this he is certainly right. The
                    conference produced "paper achievements—masks concealing failure" (p.
                    213).</p>
            <p>One should mention the author's bibliographical note. Students of this period of diplomacy
                    will find his extensive listing of published American, British, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> diplomatic papers very helpful. Also useful is his listing of the unpublished personal
                    papers of the American delegates and of other statesmen at the turn of the century, the use of which
                    greatly enhanced the value of the study.</p>
            <p>If this Beveridge Award book of 1961 has any flaws it is in the paucity of Russian sources used.
                    Russian scholars may not be satisfied by the author's statement that Yarmolinsky's
                    edition of <hi rend="i">The Memoirs of Count Witte</hi>, "explains the origin of the peace
                    rescript" (p. 219). As Sir Bernard Pares notes on page 18 of <hi rend="i">The Fall of the
                        Russian Monarchy</hi>, "Witte's book is marred by his undisguised personal

            <p>Increasing farm income was a prominent part of the New Deal effort to lift the nation out of the
                    depression. Increasing farm income had become the major activity of the American Farm Bureau
                    Federation.</p>
            <p>The Farm Bureau had lost some prestige when its efforts to have the McNary-Haugen Bill enacted into
                    law were nullified by presidential vetoes. It had lost some membership when farm prices became
                    extremely low during the depression years. The organization had much to gain in 1933 by supporting a
                    successful national farm program to increase farm income.</p>
            <p>There were difficulties to overcome. The Farm Bureau was beset with sectional differences in
                    objectives. Its membership was low in the South. In her book Mrs. Campbell describes clearly and
                    factually how the organization, under the able leadership of its colorful and sincere president, Ed
                    O'Neal of Albama, was able to surmount these and other obstacles and how the relationship
                    between the Farm Bureau and the New Deal were most cordial during the early years but strained in
                    later years.</p>
            <p>In the Preface the author indicates that a large part of her information came from documents made
                    available to her by the Farm Bureau. She states that she examined these documents "in the
                    spirit of objective scholarship." In the opinion of this reviewer, who had the opportunity
                    to observe at comparatively close range most of the events described therein, Mrs. Campbell wrote
                    the entire book in the same spirit.</p>
            <p>The book sheds much needed light on the causes of the rift between the Farm Bureau and the New Deal.
                    The widely held impression that the rift grew out of deep ideological difference is perhaps due to
                    the fact that in this case, as in nearly all struggles for political or personal power, the
                    ideological differences are overemphasized. The author refers to this struggle for power as
                    involving "many sorts of conflicts, the threads of which are exceedingly tangled"
                    (p. 159). The eight sources of conflict named on page 160 constitute a formidable list.</p>
            <p>There is a suggestion in the next to last paragraph of the book that there was a widening ideological
                    split between the Department of Agriculture, as it turned to the left, and the Farm Bureau, as it
                    turned to the right. However, the book quite properly directs its major attention to differences
                    over administrative and jurisdictional matters. Little or no evidence is presented to indicate that
                    the Farm Bureau turned to the right. Instead it is shown that the organization became more liberal
                    as it came to the support of such New Deal proposals as the Tennessee Valley Authority, reciprocal
                    trade agreements, and anti-monopoly measures. It turned neither to the left nor right in its efforts
                    to increase farm income. "Parity" became a sacred Farm Bureau slogan (p. 114).</p>
            <p>The organization worked diligently in the late 1930's to obtain appropriations which would
                    provide parity payments to farmers "for the <pb n="399" id="VAA4025-059-4-111"/> purpose of
                    bringing total market price plus payments up near the parity level" (p. 115). "In
                    order to ensure that support prices should be close to parity, the Farm Bureau was pressing
                    strenuously in 1941 for mandatory commodity loans at 85 percent of parity" (p. 132).</p>
            <p>The book makes clear that in the era it covers there was no deviation by the Farm Bureau from its
                    primary objective of increasing farm income.</p>

            <p>Neil MacNeil, the chief congressional correspondent for Time, has attempted "to define the
                    House of Representatives … as a living political institution … [in the light
                    of] its own past and traditions" (p. ix). Although he does not plow very deeply the ground
                    he has tried to cover, he has covered it. The result is a neither unentertaining nor uninformative
                    survey of the workings of the House, greatly emphasizing the post-World War II period, treating less
                    extensively the "modern House" from Thomas B. Reed to Sam Rayburn, and referring
                    sporadically to the House's first century of existence. The organization is topical, with a
                    chapter on each of fifteen major aspects of House activity, and with one exception every chapter
                    subject (the speakership, the rules, the lobbies, legislative oversight, relations with President or
                    Senate, etc.) is dealt with topically rather than narratively or chronologically even in a loose
                    sense. The author's sources were in part published monographs and documents, but he relied
                    most heavily on "the distillation of my own daily observation of the House for eight years
                    and of many thousands of conversations with its members" (p. x).</p>
            <p>From such sources and plan flow both the virtues and the defects of the book. MacNeil states clearly
                    where the House's rights and duties are unique, and where they must co-ordinate with the
                    President and the Senate. He enlivens his discussion of the speakership, and indeed his whole book,
                    by focussing on such giants as Henry <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>, Reed, "Uncle Joe" Cannon, Nicholas Longworth, and Rayburn. He
                    describes the evolution of the "political" speakers (<hi rend="i">i.e.</hi>,
                    speakers who saw themselves as more than parliamentary functionaries) and agrees with them that to a
                    great degree the strength of the House depends on the strength of the speaker. Powers, procedures,
                    and rules of the whole House and its agencies are outlined clearly. What is perhaps the
                    book's most useful section, however, is the thirty-six-page narrative, really an excursus
                    from the author's general plan, describing the battle in 1961 between Rayburn and Howard
                    Smith over enlarging the Rules Committee.</p>
            <p>Although this is a book largely without theses, the few that the author has are in some cases
                    questionable. Today's House, he says, restrains the more "liberal"
                    President and Senate because they are subject to "bullet-vote" pressures from
                    urban minority groups in populous states (p. 38). Even if this is in some sense an explanation of
                    the situation, there are surely other reasons for it. Also questionable is the repeated view that,
                    only since Woodrow Wilson's or Theodore <pb n="400" id="VAA4025-059-4-112"/>
                    Roosevelt's incursions has the President become as he is today, the usual initiator of
                    legislative programs. With the conclusions that the House has been useful, hard-working, and subject
                    to change no one would argue. On too many historical points the author is unfortunately incautious,
                    oversimple, or mistaken. For example, did Speaker Henry Clay indeed force President James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> into war in 1812 against the latter's will (p. 25)? Did Theodore Roosevelt
                    "singlehandedly settle the Russo-Japanese War of 1904" (p. 239)? And William
                    Jennings Bryan did not appear at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Democratic convention in 1896 "an unknown man" (p. 316).</p>
            <p>Perhaps it is summary enough to point out that MacNeil's strongest chapters, in this
                    reviewer's opinion, deal with very recent events or intra-House arrangements (such as the
                    1961 Rules Committee fight, or the informal "clubs" and blocs among the members),
                    and his weakest chapter is the most broadly historical one (Chapter 2, on the relations of the House
                    to the President and Senate). For an historical comprehension of the House, this book is less than
                    helpful. As a description of the Rayburn and John McCormack periods and a readable account of how
                    the House works, it is useful and informative.</p>

            <p>Not many historians can avoid being stuffy when called upon to consider such a subject as
                    generalization in the writing of history, and some of the historians involved in this present effort
                    of the Social Science Research Council have turned out essays which they might better have tucked
                    into their desk drawers. The truth is that any historian tries to make his materials say something
                    truthful and important, and that it does not help him to learn, first of all, that it is desirable
                    to do so (he knows that), nor to hear that there are (as the editor, Gottschalk, points out) at
                    least six different types of generalization. One recalls the rather sharp remark of Samuel Eliot
                    Morison during his notable presidential address to the American Historical Association in 1950.
                    Morison told his auditors that he did not believe in courses in historical method. He said that he
                    left the teaching of such courses to those of his colleagues who did not write. There is something
                    artificial about generalizing on generalization—something like the philosophy books on
                    the method of method. It lends itself to tautology, to unduly wise comment, and to a certain amount
                    of presumption. The phrase "practicing historian" recurs in these pages, which
                    seems to say that many historians do not practice and hence cannot enter the temple. This is
                    doubtless pressing the point; one knows what the authors of such essays mean; but there is a
                    generalization here which does not read well.</p>
            <p>The individual essays are of course mixed, as one would expect. Some strike fire, notably that of
                    David M. Potter, as thoughtful an analysis of generalization as one would wish for. Potter is too
                    clever <pb n="401" id="VAA4025-059-4-113"/> a person to take himself altogether seriously, and there
                    is humor as well as wisdom in his account of "Explicit Data and Implicit Assumptions in
                    Historical Study." The essays by C#2 G. Starr on problems of ancient history and Arthur F.
                    Wright on Chinese history are of much interest. Roy F. Nichols looks again at the causes of the
                    Civil War, much as the late Howard K. Beale did in the old Social Science Research Council Bulletin
                    64, that staple of graduate students of a generation ago. But for the most part the other essays
                    range from fair to poor. Robert R. Palmer's essay shows this first-rate scholar's
                    embarrassment at answering questions about his method: everything stands out stiffly in passive
                    voice. The essay by Walter P. Metzger gets off into what seem to be irrelevancies, although it is
                    learned and intelligent about them. William O. Aydelotte's essay does not raise this
                    reviewer's curiosity. The editor has a knack of killing interest in any subject he
                    discusses. Martin Klein's bibliography seems superfluous-what does one do with all these
                    titles? The most common essay of all is by Thomas C. Cochran, who wrote some odd information about
                    social role.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Old Textbooks</hi> by John A. Nietz, emeritus professor of education at the University
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is a textbook in itself. It could not be described as "light
                    reading" for the purpose of amusement, but is an authoritative study of subjects taught in
                    the common schools from Colonial times up to 1900. As a teacher of the history of education, the
                    author became interested in collecting old textbooks and consequently became an authority on their
                    treatment and coverage, as well as on the subtle transitions that took place over the years. His own
                    collection consists of eight thousand books (the Nietz Collection), but his research led him to
                    various additional reference sources through libraries and other collections.</p>
            <p>The study of these old books reveals much about the manners and morals prevalent during each period
                    represented. Chapters describing textbooks for spelling, grammar, reading, arithmetic, geography,
                    history, government, physiology, and penmanship, art, and music are included. It seems superfluous
                    to add that a book of equal size and significance could be written on textbooks since that period,
                    as our civilization and culture have broadened and the demands for special knowledge have increased
                    and such subjects as the sciences, foreign languages, vocational and business training (to mention
                    only a few) have been added to the curricula.</p>
            <p>Until 1900, however, education was basically involved with the "three
                    R's." McGuffey's <hi rend="i">Readers</hi> remained the most outstanding
                    for half a century and are still viewed with nostalgia by many. They were not only textbooks in the
                    strictest sense, but they moralized and even "preached" a bit. Among arithmetic
                    books, Thomas Dilworth's <hi rend="i">The Schoolmaster's Assistant: Being a
                        Compendium of Arithmetic both Practical and Theoretical</hi> (1773) appears to have been widely
                    used. <pb n="402" id="VAA4025-059-4-114"/> It is generally believed that the content of mathematics
                    textbooks has changed less through the years than that in any other field, although the presentation
                    has varied greatly. The third "R" will be well remembered by many for the Palmer
                    Method, with its careful execution in free-flowing style and the hours of practice required to
                    master it.</p>
            <p>Physiologies, in the earliest days, were too technical for students not directly interested in
                    medicine itself. Depending on the point of view of the writer (usually a doctor), and what he
                    considered important, texts featured the skeleton, the nervous system, the circulatory system, or
                    other technical matters far beyond the comprehension of the average young student. It
                    wasn't until later that hygiene, diet, and physical exercise for general well-being were
                    written for the younger pupil in common school.</p>
            <p>Many songbooks were compiled—but the school band or orchestra which now renders the
                    classics competently had not yet evolved. But glee clubs and choruses which attempted as much as
                    three-part harmony were beginning to appear.</p>
            <p>A work such as this, involving all the realms of subject matter, is a study of the times (the drill,
                    concentration, heavy stressing of matters perhaps no longer important in modern living, poor grading
                    for certain age groups apparent within certain areas, the featuring of morality and religion that
                    seeped through the pages). The book is a vital contribution the study of our own history.</p>

                    Indiana's population, they have been a significant one from territorial days. Since they
                    tended to dominate settlement in particular sections of the state, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>

                    have been for them to keep and preserve records about church membership, births, deaths, marriages,
                    church expulsions, removals, etc. In this volume Willard Heiss offers an abstract of records of four
                    monthly meetings in Wayne and Union counties. The book has its own particular
                    "genealogy," but, having discovered numerous errors in previous efforts concerning <placeName>

                    contribution of land-grant colleges and universities "with special attention to their
                    services to democracy" (p. vii). According to Nevins, these institutions helped give a
                    "deathblow to the narrow program of classical studies" of the pre-Civil War era,
                    lift agriculture and various trades to professional status, give education in agriculture and

                    work from religious trammels" (p. 110). The material presented is highly interpretative and
                    apparently is based largely on secondary works. The diversity of university names is such that
                    Nevins can perhaps readily be forgiven for thrice referring to Indiana University as the University
                    of Indiana (pp. 40, 99, 121), but his statement that in 1787 the nation authorized two townships of
                    land to each new state for a university is unsupported by documentation and is apparently in error

                    bibliography, index. $5.50.) This study of steamboating on the Missouri covers the period
                    from its beginnings in 1819 to 1936 when it ceased as a large-scale commercial enterprise.
                    Lass's volume is mainly concerned with the use of steamboats on the Upper Missouri between
                    Sioux City and Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName>. Attention is given to the geological background of the Missouri basin, the obstacles
                    and perils involved in navigating the river, the traffic carried, the impact of railroads and how
                    they caused steamboat navigation to move upstream as they advanced into the valley, and the role of
                    the federal government in fostering and regulating steamboats on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. Particularly interesting are the explanations about why there were usually two annual
                    rises in the Missouri River and why the Missouri required a different type of steamboat and boatman
                    from those used on the Ohio and <geogName>Mississippi river</geogName>s. During the 1930's,
                    the federal government began to erect dams along the Missouri to control floods, encourage
                    irrigation, and provide power production. But since such dams were without locks, they brought more

                    Apparently written mainly for the general reader, it recounts persistent and often unsuccessful

                    Paperbound, 30¢.) Blatchley's study of Gold and Diamonds in Indiana first
                    appeared in an annual report of the Indiana Department of Geology and Natural Resources in 1903.
                    From the 1830's (when David Dale Owen began systematic geological surveying in Indiana), to
                    the present, geologists have repeatedly indicated that Indiana has only negligible quantities of
                    gold and diamonds and that this extremely limited supply was dumped by glaciers from <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Both have occasionally been found, however, and the decision to reprint the only
                    comprehensive report on the subject was prompted by frequent enquiries about places to search. Two
                    useful supplemental maps have been added: one indicates places in Indiana where gold and diamonds
                    have been found; the other illustrates the gold-prospecting areas in <placeName>

                    Gould. (Rutland, Vt.: Charles E. Tuttle Company, Inc., 1962. Pp. xii, 243. Illustrations, index.
                    $8.60.) This is a revised and enlarged edition of a volume which first appeared in 1942.
                    Its numerous illustrations are interesting and valuable to students of American history as well as
                    to collectors of American wooden ware. Miss Gould has made an important contribution to her topic,
                    and in doing so she has revealed much about American life before the age of wood was succeeded by
                    the age of metals and plastics.</p>

                    study of the philanthropic activities of the wife of Cyrus Hall McCormick. According to the
                    author's Foreword, Mrs. McCormick—herself the recipient of charity as an orphan
                    child—donated about $8,000,000 to individuals and institutions during the
                    thirty-four years prior to her death in 1923. The summary tables in the appendix indicate that most
                    of Mrs. McCormick's donations went to education and the Presbyterian church.</p>

                    </placeName>]: E. C. Seale &amp; Company, Inc., 1962. Pp. 117. Illustrations, index.
                    $2.25.) A readable and interesting book on Indiana history is much needed for use in the
                    fourth and fifth grades of Indiana schools, and this one has some desirable features: it has a
                    number of helpful sketches and illustrations; it uses a simple narrative approach which includes
                    interesting and relevant biographical sketches; it gives attention to economic and social history as
                    well as to political and constitutional developments; and it considers history important and worthy
                    of study as a separate subject but one which includes important material from government, geography,
                    economics, and related fields. On the other hand, the content of the volume needs to be reviewed and
                    improved: material concerning Indiana since the pioneer era is inadequate; its scholarship is
                    unfortunately not as accurate or complete as it should be.</p>
