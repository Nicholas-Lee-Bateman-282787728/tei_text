                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag,
                    with the value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All
                    split lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for
                    the final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as
                    &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>

                <head>LITTLE SEAL‐SKIN.</head>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l><hi>THE</hi> Fisherman walked up the hill,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">His boat lay on the sand,</l>
                    <l>His net was on his shoulder still,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">His home a mile inland.</l>
                    <l>And as he walked amongst the whin</l>
                    <l>He saw a little white seal‐skin,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Which he took up in his hand.</l>
                    <l>Then “How,” said he, “can this thing be?</l>
                    <l>A seal‐skin, and no seal within?”</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Thus pondered he,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Partly in fear,</l>
                    <l>Till he remembered what he’d heard</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Of creatures in the sea,—</l>
                    <l>Sea‐men and women, who are stirred</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">One day in every year</l>
                    <l>To drop their seal‐skins on the sand,</l>
                    <l>To leave the sea, and seek the land</l>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7151-005"/>
                    <l rend="ti-2">For twelve long hours,</l>
                    <l>Playing about in sweet sunshine</l>
                    <l>Amongst the cornfields, with corn‐flowers,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Wild roses and woodbine:</l>
                    <l>Till night comes on, and then they flit</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Adown the fields, and sit</l>
                    <l>Upon the shore and put their seal‐skins on,</l>
                    <l>And slip into the sea, and they are gone.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l rend="ti-1">The Fisherman stroked the fur</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Of the little white seal‐skin,</l>
                    <l>Soft as silk, and white as snow;</l>
                    <l>And he said to himself, “I know</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">That some little sea‐woman lived in</l>
                    <l>This seal‐skin, perhaps not long ago.</l>
                    <l>I wonder what has become of her!</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And why she left this on the whin,</l>
                    <l>Instead of slipping it on again,</l>
                    <l>When all the little sea‐women and men</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Went hurrying down to the sea!</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Ah! well, she never meant</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">It for me,</l>
                    <l>That I should take it. But I will,</l>
                    <l>Home to my house upon the hill,”</l>
                    <l>Said the Fisherman and home he went.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>The Fisher dozed before his fire,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">The night was cold outside,</l>
                    <pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7151-006"/>
                    <l>The bright full moon was rising higher</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Above the swelling tide,</l>
                    <l>And the wind brought the sound of breakers nigher,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Even to the hill side;</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">When suddenly</l>
                    <l>Something broke at the cottage‐door,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Like the plash</l>
                    <l>Of a little wave on a pebbly shore;</l>
                    <l>And as water frets in the backward drain</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Of the wave, seeming to fall in pain,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">There came a wailing after the plash.—</l>
                    <l>The Fisherman woke, and said, “Is it rain?”</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Then he rose from his seat,</l>
                    <l>And opened his door a little way,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">But soon shut it again,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">With a kind of awe;</l>
                    <l>For the prettiest little sea‐woman lay</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">On the grass at his feet</l>
                    <l rend="ti-4">That you ever saw:</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">She began to sob and to say,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">“Who has stolen my skin from me?</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And who is there will take me in?</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">For I have lost my little seal‐skin,</l>
                    <l>And I can’t get back to the sea.”</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>The Fisherman stroked the fur</l>
                    <l>Of the downy white seal‐skin,</l>
                    <pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7151-007"/>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And he said, “Shall I give it her?</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">But then she would get in,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And hurry away to the sea,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And not come back to me,</l>
                    <l>And I should be sorry all my life,</l>
                    <l>I want her so for my little wife.”</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">The Fisherman thought for a minute,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Then he carried the seal‐skin to</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">A secret hole in the thatch,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Where he hid it cleverly, so</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">That a sharp‐sighted person might go</l>
                    <l>In front of the hole and not catch</l>
                    <l>A glimpse of the seal‐skin within it.</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">After this he lifted the latch</l>
                    <l rend="ti-4">Of his door once more,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-4">But the night was darker, for</l>
                    <l>The moon was swimming under a cloud,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">So the Fisherman couldn’t see</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">The little sea‐woman plainly,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Seeing a fleck of white foam only,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">That was sobbing aloud</l>
                    <l rend="ti-4">As before.</l>
                    <l>“Little sea‐woman,” said the Fisherman,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">“Will you come home to me,</l>
                    <l>Will you help me to work and help me to save,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Care for my house and me,</l>
                    <l>And the little children that we shall have?”</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">“Yes, Fisherman,” said she.</l>
                </lg>
                <pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7151-008"/>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>So the Fisherman had his way,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And seven years of life</l>
                    <l>Passed by him like one happy day;</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">But, as for his sea wife,</l>
                    <l>She sorrowed for the sea alway,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And loved not her land life.</l>
                    <l>Morning, and evening, and all day,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">She would say</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">To herself—“The sea! the sea!”</l>
                    <l>And at night, when dreaming,</l>
                    <l>She stretched her arms about her, seeming</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">To seek little Willie,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">It was the sea</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">She would have clasped, not he—</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">The great sea’s purple water,</l>
                    <l>Dearer to her than little son or daughter.</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Yet she was kind</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">To her children three,</l>
                    <l>Harry, fair Alice, and baby Willie;</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And set her mind</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">To keep things orderly.</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">“Only,” thought she,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">“If I <emph>could</emph> but find</l>
                    <l>That little seal‐skin I lost one day.”</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">She didn’t know</l>
                    <l>That her husband had it hidden away;</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Nor he</l>
                    <l>That she longed for it so.</l>
                    <pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7151-009"/>
                    <l rend="ti-4">Until</l>
                    <l>One evening, as he climbed the hill,</l>
                    <l>The Fisherman found her amongst the whin,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Sobbing, saying, “My little seal‐skin—</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Who has stolen my skin from me?</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">How shall I find it, and get in,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And hurry away to the sea?”</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Then “She shall have her will,”</l>
                    <l rend="ti-4">Said he.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l rend="ti-4">So</l>
                    <l>Next morning, when he rose to go</l>
                    <l>A fishing, and his wife still slept,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-4">He stole</l>
                    <l>The seal‐skin from that secret hole</l>
                    <l rend="ti-4">Where he had kept</l>
                    <l>It, and flung it on a chair,</l>
                    <l>Saying, “She will be glad to find it there</l>
                    <l rend="ti-4">To‐day</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">When I am gone,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-4">And yet</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Perhaps she will not put it on,”</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">He said, “Nor go away.”</l>
                    <l>In sleeping his wife wept;</l>
                    <l>Then the Fisherman took his net,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-4">And crept</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Into the chill air.</l>
                </lg>
                <pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7151-010"/>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l rend="ti-1">The night drew on—the air was still,</l>
                    <l>Homeward the Fisher climbed the hill.</l>
                    <l>All day he’d thought, “She will not go;”</l>
                    <l>And now “She has not,” pondered he.</l>
                    <l>“She is not gone,” he said. “I know</l>
                    <l>There is a lamp in our window,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Put ready on the sill</l>
                    <l>To guide me home, and I shall see</l>
                    <l>The dear light glimmering presently,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Just as I round the hill.”</l>
                    <l>But when he turned, there was no light</l>
                    <l>To guide him homeward through the night.</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Then “I am late,” he said,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">“And, maybe, she was weary</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Looking so long for me.</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">She lays the little ones in bed</l>
                    <l rend="ti-4">Well content,</l>
                    <l>In the inner room, where I shall find her,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-4">And where she went,</l>
                    <l>Forgetting to leave the light behind her.”</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l rend="ti-1">So he came to his cottage door,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">And threw it open wide;</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">But stood a breathing space, before</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">He dared to look inside.</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">No fire was in the fireplace, nor</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">A light on any side;</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">But a little heap lay on the floor,</l>

                    <l>Singing onwards, so happy and innocent</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Was golden‐haired Thora.</l>

                    <l>“That singing shall cease,” said the Troll, “by my head!”</l>
                    <l>Having no heart nor soul, he pledged that instead.</l>
                    <l>“I’ll silence that Spring‐bird,” the wicked Troll said,</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Said the Troll to the maid, “There’s a cottage below,</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Then he guided her down a rough crag or two,</l>

                    <l>Right under the ground. Such enchantment was thrown</l>

                    <l rend="ti-4">That was her song.</l>
                    <l>Bringing about her, floating about, in and out through the long</l>

                    <l rend="ti-1">When singing of idleness even in spring,</l>

                    <l>Or looking up into the blue heaven, was counted a crime.</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">A time harsh not sublime;</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">One terrible sort of school‐hour all the year through,</l>

                    <l>When every one had to do something, and do it by rule.</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">Why, even the babies could calculate</l>

                    <l rend="ti-3">It was always school, schools all over</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">The world as far as the sky could cover</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">It, dry land and sea.</l>

                    <l rend="ti-1">Where then did the little goose‐girl come from that day?</l>

                    <l rend="ti-1">In the broad light, with wide eyes asking,</l>

                    <l>May breaths, wandering all the school over.</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">But now the hard eyes move her,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-3">And her lips quiver,</l>

                    <l rend="ti-2">So her singing ceases: she</l>
                    <l rend="ti-2">Looking up crying, “Why,</l>

                    <l>His walk, gazed on her, listed the soft flow</l>

                    <l>Becomes a dove,” he said, “listening to thee.</l>
                    <l>Thy father calls me bondman, yet is bound</l>
                    <l>More by my strength than I slaved by his gold;</l>
                    <l>And he shall listen to me whilst I pray,</l>

                    <l>Fair for the strong, the strongest thine most fair.”</l>
                    <l>She smiled a little cruel smile, she spake</l>
                    <l>Silver‐sweet words untrue, then rose</l>
                    <l>And passed the Berserk to her home again.</l>
                    <l>But he, finding her father in the field,</l>
                    <l>Gently, yet proudly, as with right to ask,</l>
                    <l>Asked him for his Asdisa the most fair.</l>
                    <l>Hrut looked at him askance, feared the strong man.</l>
                    <l>Thought craftily, and said, “I will reward</l>
                    <l>Thee with her for a great work thou shalt do.</l>
                    <l>Hew me a road straight forward to the sea</l>

                    <l>Of strength, not anger, come on him, and tore</l>
                    <l>Huge stone from huger base, as one might pull</l>
                    <l>Pebbles from gravelly heaps, throwing them wide,</l>

                    <l>On to the very heart cleaving his way,</l>

                    <l>Of spirits from the bodies of sleepers,</l>

                    <l>So is it in dim Northland now as then.</l>
                    <l>A fox came out of Hrut, his wily soul,</l>
                    <l>Long‐tailed and hairy, a low‐bodied thing,</l>
                    <l>Smelling the ground, creeping from side to side</l>
                    <l>Warily, in dark places, and behold</l>

                <l>Clean stems grew close to each other; overhead</l>
                <l>The intertwined light branches threw</l>
                <l>Sweet shade on the rough ground.</l>
                <l>I said, “Nellie,</l>
                <l>Let us walk into the tall Wood.”</l>
                <l>She, putting her hand in mine,</l>
                <l>Led me on softly, and so replied.</l>
                <l>We made the only sound that there was,</l>
                <l>With our footsteps crushing</l>
                <l>The light tumble of leaves on scant grass;</l>
                <l>Not the ghost of a bird’s song under</l>
                <l>Any cover of bush.</l>
                <l>So along and along</l>
                <l>We went, pushing</l>
                <pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7151-039"/>
                <l>Our way where the tangled wood came,</l>
                <l>Neither inclined for talking. As for me,</l>
                <l>It was all I wanted, to walk by Nellie;</l>
                <l>And she——. O! no blame</l>
                <l>To the rapt wonder in her face.</l>
                <l>This was Nellie—</l>
                <l>The great silent glory</l>
                <l>Of the beautiful day</l>
                <l>Had found a place that he could stay</l>
                <l>In—Nellie—</l>
                <l>And wrote her through with his story.</l>
                <l>So she passed on silently,</l>
                <l>Walking by me,</l>
                <l>Heaven’s temple by me.</l>
                <l>Heaven is full of love,</l>
                <l>I thought, over and over,</l>
                <l>And said to my heart, “Hush!</l>
                <l>You are happy, certainly.”</l>
                <l>Just then, from above,</l>
                <l>Came three notes of a thrush,</l>
                <l>Satisfied, low, out of a full breast;</l>
                <l>Then Nellie broke silence, and said,</l>
                <l>“You know we shall part presently, you and I.</l>
                <l>At the end of the Wood. Friend,</l>
                <l>I’ve a favour to ask of you;—</l>
                <l>I may call you friend, and won’t tell</l>
                <l>A long tale; one word’s best.</l>
                <l>This little packet—well,</l>
                <pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7151-040"/>
                <l>Give it to Robert,</l>
                <l>Into his own hand.</l>
                <l>Thank you. He will understand.</l>
                <l>I knew you wouldn’t mind it for me.</l>
                <l>You’re not hurt?”</l>
                <l>“I—Oh, no!” I understood.</l>
                <l>After that, silently,</l>
                <l>We walked on to the end of the Wood.</l>

                    <l>Each to each, the trees</l>
                    <l>Drinking deep of heaven, and the sky taking shade from these—</l>

                <l>Single notes bandied from one to another,</l>
                <l>No two alike; each note a new‐made word,</l>

                <l>Flitting across the shadowless light of the garden.</l>
                <l>Do you hear? One word said three times over,</l>
                <l>What refrain is’t growing up in the clatter?</l>
                <l>Is it “God” they say over and over again?—</l>
                <l>There, three words repeated, what’s that! The love</l>
                <l>Of some lover, the content of some mate.</l>
                <l>Is it love, “O love, sweet, I love you?” or</l>
                <l>Wild, throbbing joy at the life‐burst of day,</l>
                <l>Life and light chanted in the cold morning.</l>

                <l>Not silence exactly, but a kind of subdued talking</l>
                <l>About breakfast and worms. Is that</l>

                <l>Rises one clear, rich song, flooding over</l>
                <l>The mixed many noises, till it and they</l>
                <l>Drop all together, and the birds fly out</l>

                <l>Made tender around her with moss and with flowers,</l>
                <l>A mound half‐circling her,</l>
                <l>Swelling to meet</l>
                <l>The soft‐falling robes and the delicate feet,</l>
                <l>One hand restwise,</l>

                <l>Now, a wistful smile</l>
                <l>As the soft wind sighs, and flutters, and sings.</l>
                <l>And a pulse that flutters her</l>
                <l>With the rush and the fall,</l>
                <l>And small fingers that carelessly</l>
                <l>Pluck the thick‐growing flowers,</l>
                <l>With a quick gesture twitch,</l>
                <l>Throwing away a few.</l>
                <l>A gasp, a surprise,</l>

                <l>The tender moss and the flowers,</l>

                <l>Mound round you pressed,</l>
                <l>Woman, earth‐caressed,</l>
                <l>Eyes downward cast,</l>
                <l>At last, O! at last,</l>
                <l>Slave with wings hidden,</l>
                <l>With divinity bidden,</l>
                <l>To sleep—nay, drown</l>

                <l><hi>I FOUND</hi> her sitting among the toys,</l>
                <l>On a low stool with idle fingers on her knees,</l>
                <l>While the slant sunlight crowned her, and as it streamed</l>
                <l>Along the shop through tiers of shelves,</l>
                <l>Touched the quaint toys with life. I came to her,</l>
                <l>And put my hand upon her arm, saying,</l>
                <l>“What is it, Lucy? The clean floor quiet</l>
                <l>From pattering feet, and these smooth shelves, and you</l>
                <l>Alone! No children peering up and down?</l>
                <l>Only bright motes swimming upon the dusty air!”</l>
                <l>She said, “The children will not come again</l>
                <l>To buy, nor I stay here to sell.” “But why?”</l>
                <l>I asked her trembling, for the sweet head drooped</l>
                <l>So low. “Is it some trouble, Lucy—ruin?</l>
                <l>May I know?” Then she looked up at me</l>
                <l>With her clear eyes, and said, “No trouble, madam,</l>
                <l>Only a change that breaks my life in two.</l>
                <l>Perhaps, one liker to me, one as poor</l>
                <l>As all my kin are poor, and one with years</l>
                <l>Few as my own—this had been more my dream:</l>

                <l>Yes, let him break it; he has taken me</l>

                <l>“But is not your young dream, my Lucy?” “No,”</l>
                <l>The sweet voice made answer, and the drooping head</l>
                <l>Drooped lower till it fell on trembling hands.</l>

                <l>That crippled man upon the flags we have</l>
                <l>So often seen, who moves our pity so;</l>
                <l>I watched him crawl along the sunny street,</l>
                <l>Through heedless crowds, until he reached the place</l>
                <l>Where crossings meet, and there he flung aside</l>
                <l>His strong companions, those two crutches worn,</l>
                <l>And sat him down upon the stones and gazed,</l>
                <l>And gazed, and gazed. Then, Jessie, all my tears</l>
                <l>Rose to my eyes and in the street I wept</l>
                <l>So I could hardly speak for weeping, but</l>
                <l>I came close up to him and paused and said,</l>
                <l>“Oh! I could break my heart against these stones</l>
                <l>To see you thus. I’d give my limbs to be</l>
                <l>Utterly broken and torn, if only by</l>
                <l>My breaking I could give you perfectness.”</l>
                <l>He smiled at me and stared with eyes—oh! not</l>
                <l>Like eyes that I once saw, whose grief had plucked</l>
                <l>Majesty from despair; his had a strange</l>
                <l>Ignorant calm, fuller of peace than pain.</l>
                <l>Jessie, he is not sorry to lie there,</l>
                <pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7151-118"/>
                <l>He never weeps as I wept for him then;</l>
                <l>He finds contentment in the gaudy street,</l>
                <l>Music in carriage wheels, a houseless home</l>
                <l>Among the people, rest in their unrest.</l>
                <l>I turned away; but, looking once again,</l>
                <l>Saw how the sun rained fire upon his head;</l>
                <l>The wan face drooped on the half‐covered breast,</l>
                <l>His eyelids closed, I thought that he was dead,—</l>
                <l>He was but sleeping. Velvet‐footed Sleep,</l>
                <l>Threading his way amid the crowds and din,</l>
                <l>Had taken him tenderly and laid him in</l>
                <l>The cradle quietness. Stretched on the ground</l>
                <l>I left him without weeping who had found</l>
                <l>Infinite pity above him and around.</l>

                <l>When I looked first at life as now at death</l>
                <l>My eyes were like two suns shining in strength</l>
                <l>That pierced with sudden glory all they saw.</l>
                <l>And “I will live a glorious life,” I said,</l>
                <l>“I will climb heights, I will shine out afar.</l>
                <l>My ‘meant to be’ complete in my ‘I am.’”</l>
                <l>I am—what am I? weary, sad, and old,</l>
                <l>I’ve failed, am weary, failed, and sad, and old;</l>
                <l>My light is quenched, ’tis dark, all dark within,</l>
                <l>I look at death and death glooms back on me.</l>
                <l>Father, what is’t? a voice—does it come from Thee,</l>
                <l>Dost Thou remember? Canst Thou pity me?</l>
                <l>“Each shall be all I meant in My great day,</l>
                <l>Thou hast not failed, ” God, do I hear Thee say,</l>
                <l>“But seven times purified, art sevenfold dear,</l>
                <l>And I’ve ten cities waiting for thee here.”</l>

                    <l>Crucified, O crucified!</l>
                    <l>And lo! “Behold me,” the pale lips sighed,</l>
                    <l>Yea, once, twice, thrice, ’twas spoken.</l>
                    <l>Then, “Behold me,” my whole soul replied,</l>

                    <l>O love! or any life alone?</l>
                    <l>You say, “Him and me,”</l>
                    <l>It should be “me” really “me,”</l>
                    <l>For ’tis this your bliss,</l>
                    <l>“I love my heart’s love, call it Him, call Him mine.”</l>
                    <l>O! awake, dear, break the mirror, see the full sun shine,</l>
                    <l>Light deep, deep shade.</l>

                    <l>I am weeping,</l>
                    <l>Oh! I could crouch to the earth, weep age on age</l>
                    <l>In the dust, break my weak body,</l>

                    <l>Christ, I could laugh at Thy great irony.</l>
                    <l>Did Thy lip quiver, did Thy heart leap compassionate?</l>

                    <l>It is all clear and wondrous in my memory.</l>
                    <l>Theresa, one night in sleep,</l>
                    <l>She had slept in prayer, with hands clasped on the cross,</l>

                    <l>Self‐penanced fallen upon the bare cold floor,</l>

                    <l>Her soul waked in his consciousness,</l>
                    <l>Down to the pit, showing her there</l>
                    <l>Her place, the very fire and depth of it,</l>
                    <l>Ready for her to inherit,</l>
                    <l>Sole lot when she had died,</l>
                    <l>Which she, all flesh, had found,</l>

                    <l>Prepared and sealed, and written over thus,</l>
                    <l>“For one Theresa, God’s enemy and the devil’s slave,”</l>

                    <l>God’s home for her, by His pure wrath declared</l>
                    <l>She pierced to its very core.</l>

                    <l>And burn her soul in the fire,</l>
                    <l>So she might love some wise.</l>

                    <l>Then she who in long lethargy</l>
                    <l>Had lain bound</l>
                    <l>Burst the cold fetters,</l>
                    <l>Broke into heavenly morn,</l>
                    <l>Night passed, awoke</l>
                    <l>Self‐slain at last, at last, at last.</l>
                    <l>Thus from death‐swoon our great saint was revived,</l>

                    <l>God‐wounded; her virgin heart</l>

                        <l>Yes, I too, we two together lived and prayed</l>

                        <l>Long since amongst the creeds</l>
                        <l>That wind all churches round;</l>
                        <l>Old paths, fair set with stream and shade,</l>

                        <l>Fair hills, fair vales sun‐kissed, sleeping in heaven’s embraces.</l>
                        <l>There your love strayed,</l>

                        <l>Strange joy, you said, strong rest and fullest quietude,</l>
                        <l>Bonds that gave zest to freedom; chained you stood</l>
                        <l>And smiled, spread all your fetters to my gaze,</l>
                        <l>Toying with them like any child with toy new bought.</l>
                        <l>I had no guide, you said, who held aloof and thought,</l>

                        <l>Then, caught my arm to an embrace,</l>
                        <l>“See, I am armour proof,” you cried,</l>

                        <l>Come in, O friend,</l>
                        <l>The days are short of grace,</l>

                        <l>Alone, one creed, one church, one food, one sacramental way to

                        <l>So pleading, whilst I heard,</l>
                        <l>As ever beloved, holding your lightest word</l>
                        <l>For truth’s own voice;</l>
                        <l>Scarcely with choice apart</l>

                        <l>My life’s whole love;</l>
                        <l>And still I heard, but could not,</l>
                        <l>Could not when most I would—</l>
                        <l>What? shut out all beside.</l>
                        <l>My brain turned faint, brought</l>

                        <l>How!—was it that <emph>I</emph> had wandered too,</l>
                        <l>Alas, alas, like you, far from the old, dear ground?</l>
                        <l>For even as I turned,</l>
                        <l>Meagre in argument, seeking the food</l>
                        <l>Of our unconscious babyhood</l>
                        <l>We had shared once content,</l>
                        <l>And eager to share once more one simple nourishment,</l>
                        <l>Offered it you in haste;</l>
                        <l>The taste, bitter to you, was to me alien.</l>
                        <l>We knew it not, our blest</l>
                        <l>Child‐home in the far years’ sunny gleam,</l>
                        <l>To you a robber’s nest, to me a dream.</l>
                        <l>Where was my peace? Had <emph>it</emph> slipt wide, or
                            <emph>I?</emph></l>

                        <l>’Twixt then and now, a waste; ’twas all I could descry.</l>

                        <l>Once only again my God‐given.</l>
                        <l>Ah! but the old pain is all new;</l>
                        <l>God, will it never die,</l>
                        <l>Of one love riven in twain?</l>
                        <l>A waste, and each fain</l>
                        <l>To o’erreach it, sending words,</l>
                        <l>Love’s messengers, that like birds</l>

                        <l>And cried loudly in my complaint,</l>

                        <l>And often a smile would steal</l>
                        <l>Across your rest, and your quiet mood</l>
                        <l>Flush with new impulse of the blood,</l>

                        <l>And calm you would reveal</l>

                        <l>And what is it worth?</l>
                        <l>Here the truth lies—</l>
                        <l>Facts of our bodily life, that our bodily eyes</l>
                        <l>Can investigate, our minds classify</l>
                        <l>Which science heaps up eternally.</l>
                        <l>O beautiful succession of causes, sequences</l>
                        <l>We can learn perfectly!</l>
                        <l>Is’t not enough? Must we scale the air</l>
                        <l>To fall again miserably, blinded, scarred,</l>
                        <l>Useless, or noisome in the world’s workshop,</l>

                        <l>And in pain I have answered, Yes.</l>
                        <l>For is not this clear, Mary,</l>

                        <l>In an age when <emph>this</emph> breaks, wallowing in the pit,</l>
                        <l>Disgraced, below popular instinct, or possible belief in it,</l>
                        <l>When science vociferates “Matter makes mind,</l>

                        <l>That I should know the unreality,</l>

                        <l>Ah! but you love Him too much, Mary,</l>
                        <l>Spare Him such worship to bless you for.</l>
                        <l>Besides, won’t you have Him eternally?</l>
                        <l>But to my empty heart, that will crumble to nothing by and bye,</l>

                        <l>There was a chill light round Him,</l>
