            <p>In 1909 Indiana freethinkers launched their first statewide organization, the Indiana Rationalist
                    Association. At its fifth convention, in 1913, the membership dissolved the state body and re-formed
                    as the National Rationalist Association. In shaping these two societies, Hoosiers shared in the
                    leadership of the country's freethought movement and its efforts to combat
                    religion's influence in American life. A description of the Indiana organization sheds
                    light on a little-known aspect of the history of Indiana and of American freethought.</p>
            <p>The term "freethinker" refers to persons who view institutional religion and its
                    theology, doctrines, clergy, and scriptures as expressions of superstition and irrationality.
                    Trusting in the superiority of natural law and scientific inquiry, freethinkers historically have
                    organized, published, lectured, and debated in an attempt to persuade individuals to cast off the
                    yoke of other-worldly concerns. Freethought in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> has waxed and waned over the past two centuries. It emerged from the
                    late-eighteenth-century American enlightenment, itself a stepchild of the European "Age of
                    Reason." In the nineteenth century freethought initially was voiced by such radical deists
                    as Ethan Allen, Elihu Palmer, and Thomas Paine. The immigration of rationalists from Europe, along
                    with public displeasure with blasphemy trials, swelled freethought ranks. Unitarianism,
                    Universalism, and Transcendentalism paved the way into freethought for some persons.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>After the Civil War the popularization of ideas concerning evolution, the beginning of studies in
                    comparative religion, the subjection of scripture to literary criticism, and the development of a
                    scientific positivism created an atmosphere of skepticism concerning religion. This "Golden
                    Age" of freethought corresponded to the life of the "archscoffer," Robert
                    G. Ingersoll (1833–1899), America's premier orator and rationalist.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Three events that occurred in the 1870s had long-range significance for
                    freethought. With the publication of the Nine Demands of Liberalism in 1872, freethinkers put forth
                    a basic platform, the core of which has never been abandoned. The Demands called for taxing church
                    properties, excluding chaplains from legislatures and military units, withholding public funds from
                    sectarian educational and charitable institutions, and abolishing Bible readings in schools,
                    judicial oaths, and Sunday observance laws. The second event was the establishment in 1873 of the
                        <hi rend="i">Truth Seeker,</hi> the most influential and durable of freethought papers. Still in
                    publication, the <hi rend="i">Truth Seeker</hi> "was almost an organization in itself, for
                    it served as a focal point around which gathered several thousand loyal partisans."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Lastly, the creation in 1876 of the National Liberal League, subsequently the
                    American Secular Union, furnished freethinkers an often weak but nonetheless essential rallying
                    point for almost fifty years.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>A vigorous, if amorphous, freethought existed in nineteenth-century Indiana. To churchmen in the
                    early 1800s frontier life bred infectious godlessness because of its isolation, feverish business
                    speculation, and intemperance. In attempting to plant Christianity throughout the West the embattled
                    home missionary discovered infertile soil, and Indiana "always had the name of being the
                    hardest to cultivate."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The minister confronted the pervasive influence

            <p>Freethinkers generally failed to build harmonious, long-lasting, and effective organizations, as they
                    held widely diverse viewpoints. How could freethought, a writer wondered in 1890, encompass everyone
                    from anarchists to spiritualists, "every Mother's soul of whom considers his own
                    ism as the particular point at issue, and make them tow a line and work in

                    liberty of expression and to decentralized societies, and its incorporation of a broad range of
                    ideas, clashed repeatedly with its essential need for a unified front. Thus, when freethinkers
                    formed associations and held meetings, the unquestioned ideal of dechristianizing the world often
                    gave way to ideological tangents, <list type="footnotes">

                    sheer bravura or reputation of leaders controlled the proceedings. If the strong hand of an able
                    leader was removed, however, intrinsic conflicts surfaced and jeoparized any group's
                    existence. By and large, freethought's difficulties with freedom and order in structuring
                    its crusade resulted in short-lived organizations, an inordinate amount of discussion of
                    organizational questions, and little immediate social impact.</p>
            <p>The twentieth century opened with freethought at low ebb. Death was taking its toll of a number of
                    the old guard.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> The American Secular Union had declined by 1900, and it did not
                    meet several years in the next decade.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> This period was, in fact, the beginning
                    of the end for the one national body that had been involved with most freethought happenings for
                    about twenty years. In reference to the languishing freethought movement, an editor of the <hi rend="i">Truth Seeker</hi> observed in 1904 "a falling away" of the
                    country's freethought presses, and in 1907 he remarked that "One looking for a
                    record of organized activity … will find little of it."<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
                    These kinds of sentiments inevitably gave rise to organizational considerations. No direct evidence
                    links the establishment of the Indiana Rationalist Association with these concerns; yet it is
                    reasonable to assume that to some extent its creation and subsequent transformation into a national
                    society were rooted in the prevailing anxiety about the circumstances and future of freethought.</p>
            <p>For the most part the behind-the-scenes activity leading to the formation of the Indiana Rationalist
                    Association remains hidden, but several significant preliminary events have come to light. On Sunday
                    afternoon, January 3, 1909, sixty-seven persons met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, to establish the Humanitarian Society. The society's main purpose
                    was to inaugurate a series of free public weekly lectures on subjects of general interest. The
                    organizers adopted a constitution and elected officers. The cost of defraying speakers'
                    expenses and auditorium rental came from membership dues of twenty-five cents monthly and from
                    voluntary collections at the door.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Each Sunday, from <list type="footnotes">

                    a short-lived political unit named the National Liberty party, Bowles was its president. A county
                    history portrayed Bowles as "a bitter opponent of dogmatic theology, believing it to be an

                    that "we have no national freethought association" was misleading considering the

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Globe-Democrat</hi> blared: "Freethinkers Meet to Unite, Wrangle."
                    Charlesworth wanted the Monistic philosophy (unity of mind and matter) of Ernst Haeckel, a
                    contemporary European zoologist, to be the ideological framework of the association. A group of
                    socialists attempted to capture the convention and have it go on record for Karl Marx or Henry
                    George. Most delegates registered disapproval of Haeckel, Marx, and George, arguing instead that
                    freethought could not tolerate having any one theorist as a guide. Next, the assembly ruled out a
                    constitutional plank calling for "good moral character and honorable deportment"
                    as a qualification for membership because they could not decide on a definition of moral character.
                    In other matters, the phrase "we believe" was scuttled from the
                    constitution's introduction because a majority thought it presupposed fixed attitudes and
                    implied lack of knowledge. One effort gained approval: the adoption of the initiative and referendum

                    ongoing struggle to institute a viable national organization. Bowles, Sanders, and the others from

                    prepare for the establishment of the Indiana Rationalist Association.</p>
            <p>The first meeting of the Indiana Rationalist Association began on December 4, 1909, rather than
                    November 21, as Sanders had announced previously. Perhaps the freethinkers desired to follow rather
                    than precede the annual observance of a week of prayer in <placeName>

                    announcement of the upcoming sessions of the Indiana Rationalist Association at which speakers would
                    "expose the fallacy, follies and vices of all so-called revealed religions and will urge
                    that the real infidels and blasphemers are the priests and preachers of orthodoxy."<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

                    1870s, characterized his listeners as the "pioneers of human progress." He
                    denounced religion as the child of ignorance and fear, theology as the "lash of the
                    priest," worship as the "folly of the feeble," prayer as "the
                    last resort of the foolish," and the Bible as no more sacred than Ralph Waldo
                    Emerson's essays.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

            <p>The delegates adopted a resolution deploring the October 15, 1909, execution of Francisco Ferrer
                    Guardia, the Spanish revolutionary who founded the antireligious, anarchistic Escuela Moderna
                    (Modern School). His trial for participating in an antigovernment uprising in Barcelona created a

                    Association set forth the organization's four major aims: to promote fellowship among
                    rationalists through an annual convention, to expose the fallacies of revealed religion, to oppose
                    the union of church and state under any guise, and to disseminate the truth of the nonexistence of

                    legislatures by sniffing out encroachments of the line separating church and state. Following the
                    practice of other freethought societies, they probably sent in news regarding clergymen's
                    immoralities and crimes. Details of America's wayward clergy appeared yearly in the Truth

                    against orthodox religion. A well-traveled lecturer, Houser had developed what he termed the New
                    Science of Life: "I teach," wrote Houser, "that life is an ethereal,
                    sublimated, intelligent energy in atomic form, and has the wisdom and power to create animated forms

            <p>The high point of the sessions was the appearance of Elbert Hubbard. Hubbard had founded the Roycroft

                    copper, silver, and leather items, expertly designed books, and mission-style furniture had achieved
                    worldwide renown. The Roycroft Inn became a gathering place for the eminent figures of the day.
                    Hubbard, though considered a freethinker, rarely participated in organized freethought. His
                    magazines, <hi rend="i">The Fra</hi> and <hi rend="i">The Philistine,</hi> contained his essays and

            <p>Calvert's message to the convention dealt with America's education system, which he
                    thought had become narrow, intolerant, and inflexible. He called for the establishment of rational
                    schools that would use nature as the setting for learning, individualize instruction, develop
                    spontaneity in teachers and pupils, and make textbooks secondary.</p>
            <p>At this convention Sanders proposed and received approval from the membership to edit and publish <hi rend="i">The Light of Reason,</hi> a volume comprised of portraits and writings of prominent men
                    and women in the Indiana body and in freethought, past and present. Many of the addresses given at
                    the 1910 meeting are printed in full in this compilation. An <placeName>

            <p>The third meeting of the association, in early November, 1911, would be its largest. More than three
                    hundred persons attended the two-day affair. Thusnelda Peemoller, a widowed <placeName>

                    although their work must often be destructive, this was only because it was necessary to destroy
                    error so truth might prevail. Mrs. Sarah Philobaum of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, told of her conversion from the Friends to freethought. Other new lecturers
                    included D.E. Kenyon, a <placeName>

               </placeName>; the latter argued that despite the
                    absence of God, capitalists like John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan kept alive a
                    "god-idea" in order to keep the masses meek and submissive. Calvert spoke on the
                    topic of rational living. Bowles, Whicker, and Sanders filled out the speaker rostrum. Sanders,
                    having in mind freethought's aversion to an afterlife, described his fellow rationalists as
                    a "bunch of people who would rob man of his fond hopes of hell for his neighbor."
                    The previous year's officers were elected for another term. The convention passed
                    resolutions against teaching religion, singing religious songs, and reading scripture in the public
                    school. It also went on record as opposing the appointment of Edward D. White, a Catholic, as chief
                    justice of the Supreme Court.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, argued that the Christian, too, is free to think. "The real Christian is
                    bound to believe only the truths which through facts are revealed to him. Neither is the real
                    Christian bound to doubt anything, and the rationalists, as I understand it, are bound to doubt some
                    things." Hill, nevertheless, expressed sympathy with the rationalist position and moved
                    even closer to it when, in 1912, he became pastor of the People's Union, a new nonsectarian
                    religious organization in the state capital.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>

            <p>The 1911 conclave would be Sanders's last, for he died of Brights disease in the spring of
                    1912, at age thirty-nine. His death deprived the Indiana society of one of its key figures and may
                    have hastened its breakup. In any case, Sanders's death created a leadership void in the
                    association that the convention of 1912 had to fill. This meeting, however, went far beyond
                    replacing the secretary-treasurer: it unveiled a totally new slate of officers. Bowles turned over
                    the presidential chair to Libby Macdonald of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Macdonald, who had served the society in various capacities, was assisted by
                    Vice-president Thusnelda Peemoller, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> schoolteacher. William Barrett, also of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, took Sanders's office. Bowles reported approval of this new arrangement, and
                    he predicted a bright future for Hoosier freethought under the women's charge. He added,
                    significantly, that the time was ripe for all freethinkers to join in a compact organization and
                    "march in solid phalanx against the hosts of superstition."<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Possibly Bowles knew more about the future of the organization than he was willing or able to reveal
                    at the time. When the 1913 convention met at the Hotel Severin in <placeName>

                    readers were assured that corrosive competition would not be the result. The National Rationalist
                    Association would concentrate on establishing lecture centers and a speakers' bureau. The

            <p>The membership, after rejecting a communication urging that the convention embrace socialism in its

                    Indiana's case considerations other than its distended membership may have accelerated the
                    quest for an all-encompassing freethought organization. For one thing, the failure of the American
                    Rationalist Association probably shifted much responsibility to the Indiana contingent and its state
                    society. In all likelihood Bowles and Sanders anticipated leading the Indiana association into the
                    national arena eventually. This goal may have been reached earlier than expected for unforeseen
                    reasons. The death of Sanders in 1912 robbed the budding society of a youthful, vigorous leader and
                    an intrepid disseminator of freethought convictions. More important, evidence suggests that prior to
                    the fourth convention, in 1912, the Indiana body was on the verge of collapse. A retrospective
                    report in the <hi rend="i">Truth Seeker</hi> in 1915 states that in 1912 Libby Macdonald had been
                    called to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to shore up the flagging society, which then had a membership of fewer than fifty and
                    an excess of debts.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> Presumably, the well-attended meetings of the first
                    several years had not produced enough dues-paying members. The membership fees and the sale of <hi rend="i">The Light of Reason,</hi> plus gratuities, were insufficient to meet society expenses.
                    Thus, far from being a body of marked efficiency and progressive influence, it had declined to a
                    point where decisive action was essential.</p>
            <p>That a set of conditions existed that rendered improbable the society's continuance in its
                    present form seemed axiomatic to Macdonald, and probably to Bowles also. To others, the situation
                    may not have looked so clear-cut. It is suggestive of an underlying resistance to the change that
                    one correspondent felt it necessary to report that the new national association "could not
                    have been prevented by any individual. It sprang from a settled and increasing demand of
                    Freethinkers throughout the land for such an organization, and not from the impetuosity or private
                    ambitions of any individual or group of persons."<hi rend="sup">59</hi> Perhaps the
                    intrusion of Macdonald into local affairs ruffled some rank and file. The problem may have been
                    aggravated by her success in persuading Marshall Gauvin, the young "Canadian
                    Ingersoll," to join her in <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>There is, then, at least some evidence that the transition was not smooth and harmonious. Perhaps
                    making matters worse, Hoosiers were not awarded any chief offices except Bowles's
                    vice-presidency, typically an honorary position. Furthermore, the National Rationalist Association
                    did not have its headquarters in the state. Macdonald initially directed the society from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>; by the fall of 1914 the address had changed to <placeName>

                    </placeName>. On the West Coast the association had moderate success in placing lecturers in the
                    field and winning affiliations from established groups, including some <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> leagues. In August, 1915, its first and only known convention took place in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The war intervened, and apparently antagonisms between American and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> members split the organization. Martin Bunge, a leader of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> societies, took on the presidency, but it is unclear if the association survived after
                    1915. Macdonald left the National Rationalist Association in 1915 and launched the Rationalist
                    Association of North America, another transient body. By 1918 she had shifted to the East Coast as
                    an official with the newly formed <placeName>

            <p>In any event, from 1913 until at least the mid-1920s, organized freethought practically disappeared
                    in Indiana, and what organization existed was of little consequence. In early 1914 a club calling

            <p>Indiana's freethought may have been organizationally weak after 1913, but several of the
                    leaders of the Indiana Rationalist Association went on to hold important posts at the national
                    level. Both Bowles and John Wesley Whicker played significant roles in efforts to stabilize the
                    decaying American Secular Union. On several occasions between 1914 and 1924 the men assumed
                    responsibilities as vice-president or acting president. Whicker functioned as president in 1923 and
                        1924.<hi rend="sup">69</hi> Neither man, however, could revive an organization that had been
                    declining for a quarter of a century. In 1924 Whicker resigned the presidency and moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. In the same year Bowles died at the age of eighty-seven. The <hi rend="i">Truth

                    the American Secular Union, which expired within a year or two. These events also closed the period

                    endeavors.</p>

            <p>Indiana had experimented with, and experienced the frustrations of, organizational freethought. The
                    Indiana Rationalist Association did inject new leadership and interest into a lackluster freethought
                    movement. Bowles, Sanders, Whicker, and others brought to their project a heritage of Hoosier
                    skepticism. Doubtless they hoped that their society would lead to the fielding of that one great
                    army of like-minded and self-sacrificing freethinkers. Co-workers from surrounding states made
                    common cause with the Indiana group, but the initial enthusiasm and support, as measured by
                    convention attendance, dried up rapidly. Then, instead of disbanding, the organization enlisted new
                    administrators and a strategy for recovery. The tactic involved promoting the old state league to
                    one of national proportions under directors more representative of the country's
                    freethought constituency. The outcome of this maneuver, touted as opening a new epoch in American
                    freethought, instead ended rationalist organization in Indiana and led to a thwarted venture in
                    guiding national freethought. Notwithstanding these organizational failures, Indiana's
                    leaders achieved distinction within the movement far beyond their state activities. When the history
                    of twentieth-century freethought is written, the brief course of the Indiana Rationalist
                    Association, along with the men and women who managed its affairs, should be accorded due
                notice.</p>

            <p>Election statistics would seem to support the view that Afro-American voters were remarkably devoted
                    to the Republican party from the Civil War until 1936 when, for the first time, a majority of black
                    voters in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> cast their ballots for a Democratic presidential candidate. Many historians and other
                    writers have implied that the alienation of blacks from the Republican party came suddenly after
                    1932, explaining the transfer of the black vote to the Democrats in terms of changes occurring
                    during the early New Deal period.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Actually the shift in black political
                    allegiance did not occur abruptly in the first term of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Black
                    disaffection with the Republican party originated long before 1936 and was clearly evident in
                    election campaigns during the 1920s, although the general black voting pattern was not basically
                    altered before the New Deal.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The 1924 election in <list type="footnotes">

            <p>If one accepts that black voters were primarily influenced by party and candidate attitudes toward
                    racial issues involving fundamental principles, it is apparent that the 1924 <placeName>

                    of equality before the law without regard to color had been more closely identified with the
                    Republican than with the Democratic party in the minds of blacks since the Civil War. The Republican
                    party was associated with Abraham Lincoln, the Emancipation Proclamation, and support for the
                    thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments to the Constitution; the Democratic party was yoked
                    to the white South, which had defended slavery, and to opposition to the postwar constitutional

                    blacks and the other as hostile to them was blurred during the late nineteenth century and early
                    twentieth century. During the 1870s the Democratic party took a "new departure"
                    and thereafter moderated its racial policies, and the Republican party, particularly after the 1876
                    presidential election, steadily retreated from its earlier strong position in defense of the legal
                    rights of black people. During the 1920s the Republican party almost completely abandoned the cause
                    of black rights. Meanwhile, a small minority of Afro-Americans voted Democratic, and some leading
                    blacks urged Afro-Americans to liberate themselves from the Republican party by becoming political
                        independents.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Yet nothing occurred to reverse the traditional perception of
                    the majority of blacks that the Republicans were more sympathetic to them on principle than the
                    Democrats, and they voted accordingly. The alteration of this perception among blacks in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> blacks associated the Republican party of Indiana with supporters of racially
                    discriminatory views and practices, particularly with the Ku Klux Klan, which had been organized in
                    Indiana after World War I. The rise of the Klan in Indiana accompanied the extension of segregation
                    of blacks in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the 1920s. An image of a Klan-dominated Republican party of Indiana grew out of
                    the primary campaign and primary election of 1924. The Klan endorsed a slate of candidates for
                    Republican nominations for local and state offices. These candidates included Secretary of State Ed
                    Jackson, who was seeking the Republican gubernatorial nomination. Jackson made only a minimal effort
                    to attract black voters, who had traditionally constituted a significant bloc of the Republican
                    voter support in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Klan-backed candidate employed the usual Republican means of appealing for black
                    votes, including political advertisements in black newspapers and campaign activity by a small cadre
                    of black patronage workers. Jackson's black campaign workers stressed the secretary of
                    state's appointments of blacks to patronage jobs, and his advertisements in the black press
                    carried a statement supporting just law enforcement without regard to race.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                    he added, "are you a Democrat or Republican. This campaign is based upon the question
                    ‘Are you a KKK or not?’ There are two leading candidates for Governor in

            <p>The primary results indicated to blacks that the Republican party of Indiana was less likely to
                    defend the principles that were of concern to them than was the Democratic party in the state. In
                    addition, during the primary period and the weeks following it the Democratic party in Indiana moved
                    cautiously to build an image of the state party as an opponent of prejudice and discrimination on
                    grounds of race as well as nationality and religion. In the primary the winner of the Democratic
                    gubernatorial nomination was Carleton B. McCulloch, an <placeName>

                    contrast to the Republican gubernatorial nominee, who had not denied accusations that he was a Klan
                        member.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Also, the Democratic organization had slated a black man, John

                    city voted for Klan-endorsed candidates, thereby defeating the black candidates for Republican
                    nominations for state offices, while most of the local white Democrats voted for Bankett.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Following the primary the Democratic state convention unanimously adopted a

            <p>The 1924 Indiana primary results concerned Afro-Americans throughout the nation. The nomination of
                    the Klan-endorsed gubernatorial candidate in Indiana was seen as an egregious example of the
                    regressive racial policy of the Republican party, which had already alienated many blacks. By 1923
                    many black leaders had a list of grievances against the Republican party; of particular concern was
                    its failure to effect the enactment of federal anti-lynching legislation.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> In
                    consequence, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) had advocated
                    black political independence from the Republican party by proposing "a new political
                    emancipation" in 1923.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Thus in 1924 the national office of the NAACP
                    did not hesitate to criticize the Republican party of Indiana regarding the Ku Klux Klan. Almost
                    immediately following Jackson's nomination the national press service of the NAACP issued a
                    press release advising Indiana blacks "to make the Klan the paramount issue" and
                    to vote against the party or candidates not repudiating Klan support.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> At the

                            platform planks on civil and political rights that were more vague than before; attempted to
                            reduce the participation of blacks in the affairs of the national party; was generally
                            indifferent to the issue of federal protection of the right to vote; did not discontinue
                            racial segregation of federal employees; and gave fewer federal appointments to blacks than
                            it had before the 1920s. The national Republican party's relationship to blacks

                    shortcomings and urging blacks to vote independently without regard to party labels. Addressing the
                    NAACP conference, Secretary Johnson stated: "The biggest single political issue before him
                    [the American Negro] is that of the Ku Klux Klan." After outlining the situation in

                    two former Republican candidates for office, a former Republican patronage worker, and a current
                    Republican precinct politician. Most of the officers had actively supported the Republican party in

                    issued press releases and held public meetings on almost a weekly basis. League press releases
                    announced that thousands of Indiana blacks were leaving the Republican party, urged blacks to
                    register to vote, and publicized recruitment successes, perhaps with some exaggeration. League
                    membership claims were two thousand in August and five thousand in early September. The league
                    announced that it had recruited seven thousand members during a ten-day period at the end of
                    September. Notaries registered black voters at the league office. The political rallies of the
                    league were highly publicized and well attended, usually by hundreds of reportedly enthusiastic
                    persons. A different roster of speakers, largely composed of influential local black personalities,
                    appeared at each meeting. For example, eight black clergymen of <placeName>

                    </placeName> were scheduled to speak at the league's October 13 anti-Klan rally.
                    Collections taken at these rallies partially defrayed league expenses.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

                    The <hi rend="i">Freeman</hi> reported that the same faces were repeatedly seen at the Republican

                    sought to maximize the white Protestant vote for the Republican ticket in order to counterbalance

                    for blacks, Ernest G. Tidrington, declared: "This little thing that has happened has

                    Although handicapped by the failure of his party's national convention to pass an anti-Klan

                    his major opponents, Republican Calvin Coolidge and Progressive Robert M. La Follette. Davis further
                    promised that as president he would make no distinctions based on race or creed. Also, the

                    meetings, pamphlets, press releases, and newspaper columns of each side. The basic question of the
                    debate in the larger arena was which party would be most likely to uphold principles, particularly
                    equality before the law, of fundamental importance to black people. In regard to these principles
                    the basic argument in support of the proposition that blacks should vote Republican was embodied in
                    the old maxim of Frederick Douglass, "The Republican party is the ship, all else is the
                    sea." According to this argument, the black voters owed the Republican party a debt of
                    loyalty because it had been responsible for the application of these principles to black people,
                    with examples ranging from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Emancipation Proclamation and the post-Civil War constitutional amendments
                    to statutes against racial discrimination. Furthermore, the Democratic party was historically
                    hostile to the extension of these principles to blacks, as evidenced by the lynching of blacks,
                    racial segregation statutes, and disenfranchisement of black voters in the Democratic states of the
                    Solid South. Instances of racial discrimination practiced by former Democratic city administrations

            </p>
            <p>The major argument in support of the position that blacks should vote Democratic was that the
                    Republicans had abandoned the principles of the party of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as indicated by the party's retreat from its earlier position of strong
                    opposition to racial discrimination. The overriding evidence of the Republican regression was the
                    nomination of the Klan-endorsed ticket by Indiana Republicans. The Ku Klux Klan stood for the
                    antithesis of equality before the law, urging instead discrimination based upon race, religion, and
                    national origin. Furthermore, the Indiana Democratic leaders condemned the Klan and promised to

            <p>The Republican rebuttal regarding the Klan and the state party was muted, with the issue played down
                    and characterized as a Democratic artifice. The Democratic party, it was noted, had been associated
                    with the Klan in the South following the Civil War and still was. All white people were Kluxers, and
                    one might as well vote for one as another. Furthermore, the Indiana Klan was not against black
                    people but was "trying to down the Jew and the Catholic."<hi rend="sup">64</hi>
                    The response in turn for the Democrats was that the Klan should be condemned on principle for
                    discriminating against Catholics and Jews, that the Indiana Klan was clearly hostile to blacks as
                    shown by its statements and actions favoring white supremacy, and that, while the Klan influenced
                    the Democratic party in the South, it dominated the Republican party in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">65</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rebuttal to the argument for black loyalty to the Republican party was as follows. Black voters
                    had repaid any debt to the Republican party with their almost unbroken support of it in local and
                    national elections since the Civil War. Regardless, black voters were not deserting the Republican
                    party because the party had deserted them when it sided with the Klan. Furthermore, black voters
                    could express loyalty to the Republican party by voting Democratic in 1924 as a means of defeating
                    Klan candidates and rescuing the state party from the hands of an organization opposed to the
                    principles of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In addition, black support of the Democratic ticket would be an expression of
                    political independence which might ultimately enhance black political power by requiring the
                    political parties to compete with each other for black votes. Finally, black votes for the
                    Democratic ticket would at least be an expression of protest against the Republican party's
                    desertion of principles important to black people.<hi rend="sup">66</hi>

            <p>Each side in the contest charged that some of its opponents had been corrupted by political bribery.
                    For example, one of the most outspoken black critics of the Klan and the Republican party, the
                    Reverend Charles Sumner Williams, was called "the French Lick donation seeker,"
                    the reference being to a favorite meeting place of the state Democrats. At the invitation of
                    Williams, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate had made a speech criticizing the Klan during a
                    political and educational rally at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church. The meeting had been called for the purpose

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    the Klan-backed <hi rend="i">Ledger,</hi> charged that Williams had mixed politics and religion and
                    that the Democratic organization had donated one thousand dollars to his church. Also, black
                    organization men supporting the Republican party failed in an attempt to pressure the
                    pastor's bishop to reassign him to a church in another city.<hi rend="sup">69</hi> In
                    retort, the <hi rend="i">Freeman,</hi> a voice of the anti-Klan movement, observed that the
                    Republican party sought the support of black churches, noted that the Republican gubernatorial
                    candidate mixed religion and politics in seeking the endorsement of the local black Baptist
                    ministerial alliance, and referred to black clergymen supporting the Klan-endorsed ticket as
                    "Judas preachers."<hi rend="sup">70</hi> The <hi rend="i">Freeman</hi> apparently
                    singled out for special criticism the Reverend Benjamin F. Farrell of Mt. Paran Baptist Church.

            <p>Political intimidation was used as the election drew near. One hundred fifty black postal workers,

                    welcomed by crowds of poll workers and voters. The high level of black interest in the election was
                    indicated by the long lines of voters at polls in the morning. The bulk of the votes were cast
                    before noon in the black precincts, although in past elections most black voters had customarily

                    Klan-endorsed ticket and for Democratic candidates. Both Davis and McCulloch, Democratic candidates
                    for president and governor respectively, were given majorities in black areas. According to
                    contemporary estimates, 70 to 80 percent of the black vote in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> went to the Democrats.<hi rend="sup">76</hi> This was true in many of the black
                    precincts. In fact, McCulloch obtained 84 percent of the votes in one heavily black precinct (the
                    eighth in the First Ward). A tabulation of the total votes in the city's twenty-one
                    predominantly black precincts showed that McCulloch received 69 percent of the votes in those
                        precincts.<hi rend="sup">77</hi>

                    heavy Republican vote in white districts of the county that were normally Democratic. Ed Jackson and
                    most of the Klan-endorsed ticket in Indiana were elected in the Republican landslide of 1924 which
                    kept Calvin Coolidge in the White House.<hi rend="sup">78</hi> Shortly following the election, black
                    anti-Klan leaders averred that they were not disappointed by the election results, claiming that the

                    Governor-elect Jackson ran more than 100,000 votes behind President Coolidge in Indiana and that
                    Jackson obtained significantly fewer votes than some of the Republicans elected to Indiana state

                    merits of the candidates in the opposing parties. This was suggested, for example, by the fact that

                    status of blacks. The Republican years of the early 1920s were relatively prosperous ones for blacks
                    in the North; employment and income figures were higher for blacks as a group in the North from 1917
                    to 1927 than before.<hi rend="sup">83</hi> And the enormous disparity in the economic status of
                    blacks and whites, which was a constant historical element in American society, was not made an
                    issue in the 1924 election. The Ku Klux Klan was the overriding and almost exclusive issue for

                    after 1924 blacks tended to vote for the party perceived as being more sympathetic to the principle
                    of equality. In this regard, there was a reversal of the perceptions of the two parties among blacks

                    one-party tie and remained so in 1926. White apparently hoped that Indiana might serve as a model
                    for teaching the independent voting habit to blacks in other states. In this regard, White asked
                    Lionel F. Artis of the <placeName>

                    Indiana were "in a sorry position politically" and concluding that Indiana had
                    nothing "to offer as a solution to difficulties being experienced in other

                    polls. The city's black voters and political figures were evidently demoralized politically
                    by the 1924 election results and their aftermath. Despite the large anti-Klan black vote, the 1924
                    election enhanced the Klan's power in <placeName>

                    political inducements, the Republicans succeeded in drawing some of the black anti-Klan politicians
                    back into the party fold by 1925. Shortly after the 1924 election, the press reported that
                    Republican politicians who had worked against Jackson would be relieved of their political jobs.
                    This included black politicians who had worked at the polls in favor of Coolidge for president and
                    McCulloch for governor. Some black politicians probably returned to the Republican party in order to
                    stay on its payroll. According to a white Republican boss, <list type="footnotes">

                    1925 in return for a bribe of $25 each. But the Republicans did not make a strong effort
                    to get out the black vote in 1925, and only a few black politicians worked for the party ticket.<hi rend="sup">91</hi>

                    </placeName> blacks following the 1924 election. In the first instance, the Democrats developed no
                    permanent alliance with the black constituency while courting the black vote in 1924. Indeed, the
                    Democrats assumed an attitude of indifference to the city's black vote after 1924. The
                    party was apparently not interested in exploiting its opportunity to hold <placeName>

                    the black vote but lost the election. Not surprisingly, the Democrats were accused of making
                    "covert attempts to secure some of the Klan support" in 1925.<hi rend="sup">92</hi>

                    </placeName>, and in fact there was an absence of such leadership in 1925. Black politicians who
                    assumed the role of political leadership were Republicans of the "old school," as
                    Lionel Artis described them, politicians who would be "satisfied when they themselves are
                    ‘taken care of’, meaning a clerkship … or custodianship of the
                    courthouse or City Hall or given the privilege of running a gambling house."<hi rend="sup">93</hi> Recognition of such leaders either by the Republican party or by black voters was
                    "almost nihil [sic]." The association of the Republican party with the Klan, which
                    had created the anti-Klan black constituency for black insurgent leaders in 1924, still existed, but
                    black voters were demoralized and could not be induced to support the Democratic party in the face
                    of its recent attitudes and actions affecting blacks.<hi rend="sup">94</hi>

                    "the great group of ordinary [black] voters" were dissatisfied with the existing

            <p>The national movement for independent voting by blacks, which accelerated during the 1920s, continued
                    during the 1930s. Black voters in the <placeName>

                    candidates by a growing body of noted black men, newspapers, and organizations in each presidential
                    election after 1924. To paraphrase Bagnall, black Americans were being taught the independent voting
                    habit. During this period the black image of the Republican party as the sacrosanct party of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>

                    declining numbers, down to 1936. Black alienation from the Republican party was offset by the
                    negative black image of a national Democratic party controlled by white Democratic leaders from
                    southern states where blacks were legally segregated and disenfranchised.<hi rend="sup">98</hi>

                    Republican candidate, was criticized for continuing the regressive racial policy of the Republican
                    party during his presidential administration. On the other hand, Franklin D. Roosevelt, the

            <p>Viewed in retrospect, the results of the presidential elections from 1920 through 1932 show that the
                    1924 election was a point of departure in a historical process of political realignment in black <placeName>

                    </placeName> (Table I). In presidential elections prior to 1924 most <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> black voters were Republican. In keeping with this tradition, the Republican
                    presidential candidate won 75 percent of the city's black vote in 1920. However, during the
                    period 1924–1932 Republicans were the minority of the city's black constituency,
                    with the majority consisting of Democrats and independents. The percentage of the black vote for the
                    Democratic candidate varied in elections from 1924 through 1932 because there was a considerable
                    body of black independents who sometimes voted Democratic. The fact that the Democratic candidate
                    obtained the majority of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> black vote in two of the three presidential elections prior to 1936 indicates that the
                    total number of black Democrats and black independents exceeded the number of black Republicans
                    throughout the period 1924–1932.</p>
            <p>That black Americans, especially young voters, were prepared to leave the Republican party is
                    indicated by the events of the 1920s and early 1930s. Nevertheless, the majority of blacks in
                    America saw no political alternative supportable on principle until 1936, when the Democratic
                    presidential candidate received most of the nation's black vote, including 75 percent of
                    the black total in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. By that time President Roosevelt and the New Dealers had, in a variety of ways,
                    presented a Democratic image more favorable to the principle of racial equality than that of the
                    Republicans. New Dealers had included blacks in their federal economic programs, and President and
                    Mrs. Roosevelt had developed reputations for amicable relationships with black individuals and
                    groups. President Roosevelt had recognized the political interests of blacks by creating a
                    "Black Cabinet" and by seeking the advice of a group of astute black political
                    observers, including Freeman B. Ransom, who had supported the Democratic party in 1924 as a leader
                    of the Independent Voters League. During the 1936 campaign black political activists and black

                  <hi rend="sup">10</hi> Bowers's diary was kept in a small black book and written in
                        pencil. The volume begins on August 19, 1862, and continues sporadically until May 2, 1864. The
                        later entries have to do only with Bowers's ministerial reponsibilities and his
                        spiritual life. Although the book is well preserved, the exigencies of writing under camp
                        conditions often rendered his handwriting difficult to read. The editor has attempted to
                        transcribe Bowers's original spelling, capitalization, and punctuation, which are very
                        inconsistent. [<hi rend="i">Sic</hi>] is added only after grammatical peculiarities. Illegible
                        words are indicated as such in brackets; in cases where the editor has minor doubts about the
                        transcription of a word, that word is followed by a question mark in brackets; wherever the
                        editor could make only an educated guess as to the proper transcription of a word, it is placed
                        inside brackets with a question mark. Persons and places are identified in footnotes where
                        possible.</item>

                                    until night which we respected. At night we laid down expecting to renew the

                                    had whiped a very superior force of well drilled rebels with our raw troops. We
                                    buried our dead and kept a sharp look out for the enemy but were not molested during

                                    our artilery commenced playing upon the enemy. The fight lasted most of the day. It

                                    we refused to do. The parley continued all night. Col Wilder went out with the
                                    confederates to see their works and found them very extensive. They had about

                                    for Capt. Applewhite. Many like myself wept like children. We were then commanded to
                                    march. In doing this we were compelled to march thru the ranks of the federals.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> They were the dirtiest hardest[?] and most disorganized set

                                    The general treated us with much kindness. We found pretty good quarters at a

            <p>Stephen Bowers's health worsened after his return home, and later diary entries indicated
                    that he had been seriously sick. On January 21, 1863, he wrote that he was "suffering with
                    enlargement of the liver and a nervousness." He was never able to rejoin his regiment for
                    longer than several days, and he was discharged May 4, 1863, due to ill health, which he later
                    described as "chronic inflamation of the liver or hepatitus, brought on by
                        exposure."<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Until 1871 Bowers continued to serve various Methodist churches in Indiana. In that year he was

            <p>Bowers's later career was varied and controversial. He returned to <placeName>

                    State.</hi> Particular targets for his criticisms were local saloons and county government.<hi rend="sup">69</hi> He also was an avid excavator of Chumash Indian relics along the Santa
                    Barbara coast. Although one later archaeologist characterized Bowers with disdain as a "pot
                    hunter," this was chiefly because Bowers worked before the days of modern standardized
                    field methods. Recent research has shown that he was actually more observant than most
                    archaeologists of his time. Bowers shipped the majority of his many finds to the Smithsonian

                    figures, bibliographical essay, index. Clothbound, $12.00; paperbound, $6.00.)</head>
            <p>The Indiana Historical Society should be proud of its selection of James H. Madison to author this
                    volume in the <hi rend="i">History of Indiana</hi> series. He has produced an exceptionally well
                    researched study of the state between 1920 and 1945. He has diligently pulled together available
                    primary materials, including oral history, and an excellent array of secondary sources. An example
                    of the latter is his use of M.A. theses and Ph.D. dissertations.</p>
            <p>The first five chapters of the book use a chronological format, and the succeeding seven chapters are
                    topical. This arrangement enables the reader to establish political pegs on which to hang the
                    economic, social, and cultural developments of the period. In addition the author provides an
                    illuminating backdrop of national events in order to provide an interesting comparison between
                    Indiana and the rest of the nation.</p>
            <p>Although Madison was not able to use Joel Garreau's <hi rend="i">Nine Nations of North
                        America</hi> (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1981), he reached similar conclusions about Indiana's political, social, and
                    economic makeup. According to Garreau, Indiana is one of the few states that manages to incorporate
                    three regions within its boundaries—"The Breadbasket," "The
                    Foundry," and "Dixie." <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> uses the concept to illustrate Indiana's changes in the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>Hoosiers in the southern half of the state are related politically, economically, and socially to
                    their fellow Americans south of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. Agriculture in the broad
                    fertile central area west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> illustrates the zeal for scientific agriculture as applied to corn and beans and
                    livestock in the "Breadbasket." Indiana also developed a significant industrial
                    base in primary industries such as steel production, transportation, and oil products during the
                    first half of the century and thereby became an important component of the
                    "Foundry."</p>

               <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> explores the complex political interests of Indiana with an appreciation for the three
                    areas of the state mentioned above. The urbanization and industrialization of Indiana altered <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-079-2-085"/> political coalitions, and the Great Depression affected
                    political leadership. Even today, however, the state retains its basic political outlook and remains
                    divided along the dimensions observed by Garreau.</p>
            <p>An interesting feature of this study is <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s inclusion of thumbnail biographies of individuals who have shaped
                    Indiana's history. Especially valuable are his observations about Claude R. Wickard, Paul
                    V. McNutt, and Dr. Ada Schweitzer, to name only a few. These individuals reacted to events and
                    helped to shape the state's response to the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>Indiana's history reflects the triumphs and tragedies in our recent history. During the
                    1930s and 1940s labor organizations and scientific agriculture in the state helped to usher in a
                    rising standard of living. Political reorganization in the 1930s enabled the state to cope with a
                    mass society. Even the tragedy of Ku Klux Klan activities of the 1920s gave way to subsequent
                    improvement in race relations.</p>
            <p>Finally, the Society should be congratulated on the desire to produce a well-turned-out book. The
                    type face is clean, footnotes appear at the bottom of the page, the bibliographical essay will be
                    useful to students of the state's history for many years to come, and the index is
                    carefully prepared. This effort has enhanced the author's purpose to focus on the
                    relationship of Indiana to the rest of the nation.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Their Infinite Variety</hi> is a companion volume to <hi rend="i">Gentlemen from
                        Indiana: National Party Candidates, 1836–1940,</hi> edited by Ralph D. Gray in 1977
                    and reviewed in this journal by Holman Hamilton (June, 1978, pp. 157–58). Like the
                    earlier volume in the Indiana Historical Bureau's ambitious series, this book is composed
                    of twelve essays, in this instance spotlighting "a variety of Hoosier politicians, from the
                    famous to the relatively unknown" (p. v). Spanning the period from William Hendricks and
                    early statehood to Charles Marion LaFollette in World War II and the early Cold War, these essays
                    reassess the role of Hoosier politicians within biographic contexts. Lorna Lutes <pb n="188" id="VAA4025-079-2-086"/> Sylvester limits her careful examination of Oliver P. Morton more
                    narrowly to his extraordinary direction of Indiana finances, 1863–1865, while Philip R.
                    VanderMeer, through the use of collective biography, departs more substantially from the typical
                    format of the essays in his analysis of speakers of the Indiana House of Representatives,
                    1896–1920. A number of pieces are based on recent dissertations from Indiana University;
                    all reflect the most recent scholarship on their topics.</p>
            <p>Readers will naturally respond differently to the selection of subjects and the coverage of each.
                    This reviewer was most fascinated by Charles W. Calhoun's masterful treatment of Walter Q.
                    Gresham as a Republican "Jeremiah" torn by contraditions and quixotic drives and
                    by Ernest C. Bolt, Jr.'s discussion of Louis L. Ludlow, who can now be understood as a more
                    sympathetic figure than the stereotypical isolationist and peace advocate of war referendum
                    reputation. In addition to LaFollette and Ludlow, coverage of Will H. Hays brings to three the
                    number of twentieth-century figures examined; Henry Smith Lane, Jesse David Bright, Lew Wallace,
                    James "Blue Jeans" Williams, and John W. Foster round out the nineteenth-century
                    Hoosier politicians. The collection is especially strong in covering the turbulent 1850s and 1860s
                    as well as demonstrating the personal pettiness and political maneuvering that cut across the
                    generations.</p>
            <p>Whether <hi rend="i">Their Infinite Variety</hi> comes close to an adequate title or a conceptual
                    means of unifying this collection is doubtful. All of the subjects are white men of greater
                    education and wealth than their peers and with moderate electoral or appointive successes; nearly
                    all were fiscal conservatives. The contradiction between the title and the actual coverage points
                    out the urgent need for accelerated study of women and ethnic politicians in Hoosierland along with
                    radicals, failures, and those whose faces were more likely to grace post office walls than postage
                    stamps. Within the context of this book, one especially wishes to know more from Sylvester of
                    Morton's postwar state and national role; conversely, Lew Wallace may not warrant as full a
                    coverage as he receives, and "Blue Jeans" Williams does not become as politically
                    believable as he certainly must have been. More serious is the felt need for an ample introduction
                    or afterword to provide more focus and synthesis to the various parts of this volume. In fact, it is
                    not clear how this book came together, as no editor seems to claim responsibility for it. So much is
                    the pity, for other aspects of the editing and production are excellent: there are no typographical
                        <pb n="189" id="VAA4025-079-2-087"/> errors, the index is sufficient, the binding and typography
                    are handsome, and the footnotes and bibliographic essays are a guided tour through the current
                    source materials of Indiana political history.</p>
            <p>Aficionados of Indiana history or political biography will devour this book from cover to cover; for
                    others it will serve as reserved reading to supplement textbooks in Indiana history courses or as a
                    useful library reference work.</p>

            <p>A good history of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Water Company would be extremely valuable to students of the city's past.
                    Little now exists on the subject, and what does is scattered, fragmentary, and dated. Such a
                    pioneering work would require the labor of several years. <hi rend="i">Water Runs Downhill</hi> is
                    not that work. Most of the familiar histories of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> appear in the bibliography, along with newspaper items, magazine articles, a few
                    company pamphlets, and numerous interviews with past and present employees. Research for this book
                    thus entailed no small effort, but the result, nonetheless, is not serious history. There are no
                    maps or charts or footnotes. The photographs are often pointless. The number of employees at any
                    time in the company's history is never stated, nor is the company the true spine of the
                    book. Rather, the narrative follows the lives of the managers and owners with the emphasis as much
                    on their careers outside as within the firm.</p>
            <p>The writer, the wife of the company's director of governmental affairs, was assured that the
                    project was "not intended as a routine exercise in corporate goodwill," and she
                    asserts that the book stands as a "candid account" (p. 5). In the Preface, the
                    chairman of the board expresses the hope that although "judgments tend to be less critical
                    of the living," the reader "will not misinterpret… favorable
                    comments" about company officials (p. 3). Here the board chairman is the better guide, for
                    the work is a litany of all that is of good report of company officials since its founding. This is
                    not always easy: <pb n="190" id="VAA4025-079-2-088"/> strenuous effort and psychological obtuseness
                    are required to conclude that Clarence Geist, owner of the water company from 1912 to 1938, a
                    boorish, unlovable rogue, was down deep an engaging softy.</p>
            <p>Apparently the author was under serious time constraints, which would explain certain problems of
                    style. There is persistent resort to cliché: noses are put to grindstones, occasions are
                    momentous, fate smiles, ears are bent, pride is pointed to, minds are boggled, laurels are rested
                    on, and, inevitably, waters are muddied and go over dams. Locutions of uncertainty alternate with
                    locutions of emphatic assertion; that is, too often things are "reputedly,"
                    "reportedly," "must have been," "maybe,"
                    "perhaps," "apparently," or they are "truly,"
                    "in truth," "indeed," "in fact,"
                    "certainly," "even," "undoubtedly," and
                    "needless to say." Moreover, a breezy style and efforts at fine writing produce
                    some peculiarities: <geogName>Crown Hill</geogName> Cemetery, once a popular picnic spot accessible
                    by trolley and canal boat, is the "tombstone terminal" (p. 42). Describing the
                    city's celebration of the new century, the author allows that "those were fun
                    times, for sure" (p. 48). Thomas A. Morris, a civil engineer with a lifelong interest in
                    railroads (the "iron horse," p. 34), is a man who "ultimately carved his
                    name along the most progressive tracks of the times" (p. 35).</p>
            <p>While the primary audience for this work is neither the serious student nor the general reader but
                    the relatives, friends, and employees of the management, the book is often interesting. A story
                    involving a Geist or the Murchison brothers of Texas has its fascination. More important, at times
                    the book suggests one of the realities of a privately owned public utility—or of any big
                    business—the necessarily close relationships between private and public loci of power and
                    influence. The text contains hints of the network of elite leadership in the city and the
                    realization that political ability in a manager is as useful to a firm as business acumen. Finally,
                    the book tells more than was previously known about an important <placeName>

            <p>In anticipation of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the town of Munster's incorporation
                    (1907), Lance Trusty has written a <pb n="191" id="VAA4025-079-2-089"/> fact-filled account that
                    chronicles the development of a Dutch farming community into a bustling, prosperous suburb. In 1910,
                    three years after its incorporation, Munster's population numbered 543, the majority of
                    whom were involved in agriculture. By 1960 the "town on the ridge" had reached
                    10,313 in population and had become "the home of the highest percentage of professional and
                    managerial people of any town or city in the state" (p. 41); by 1982 Munster had well over
                    20,000 residents, whose "average educational level, income, and standard of living were
                    among the highest in Northwest Indiana" (p. 48).</p>
            <p>The town's rapid growth, particularly during the 1930s, created a sense of buoyancy and a
                    level of expectation that ushered in succeeding decades of continued growth accompanied by numerous
                    difficulties. Attracted to the town by its clean air, low taxes, little or no crime, good zoning
                    laws, and sound government, Munster's new residents came seeking the "good
                    life"—"the greatest amount of happiness… with the minimum
                    expense… " (p. 33). However, the sheer number of ex-urbanites who came (largely
                    from <placeName>

                    works—sewers, roads, waste collection and disposal services, parks,
                    schools—and countless other civic improvements that collectively make life comfortable
                    but also expensive. The town's founders and their families, confused and somewhat
                    bewildered by these events, sold their farms and moved to rural communities farther south.</p>
            <p>Left alone to determine their future, Munster's new residents continued to develop farmland
                    into sites for new homes, schools, churches, and shops. They gave birth to a whole range of social
                    clubs and civic organizations. Solidly Republican and racially homogeneous, they persisted in their
                    support for small government, low taxes, rapid expansion, <hi rend="i">and</hi> a high level of
                    municipal service. Only gradually and after many heated discussions did they come to realize that
                    water, transportation, fire protection, health care, etc., were costly commodities even when managed
                    well.</p>
            <p>On their seventy-fifth anniversary Munsterites have reason to be proud. They have created a
                    relatively pleasant place to live, and Trusty has shown, in brief, how they did it. However, what he
                    has failed to explain, even briefly, is why such a determined and right-minded people (who
                    subsequently erected a billboard to welcome visitors to the "Town of Integrity")
                    worked so hard to create the "good life" and then refused to share it with all.
                    This omission is a critical one since Munster serves as a bedroom community for two large racially
                    heterogeneous <pb n="192" id="VAA4025-079-2-090"/> cities, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Gary. In this short history the author does not treat adequately the processes of
                    urbanization and suburbanization—subjects that deserve careful examination by students
                    and teachers of Indiana history. Yet the author and those who assisted him should be commended for
                    their work, the first full-fledged explanation by a professional (Trusty is director of the Regional
                    Studies Institute at Purdue University Calumet) of how Munster came to be.</p>

            <p>"Beware the People weeping/ When they bare the iron hand." Herman Melville wrote
                    these words to express the mood of America in the aftermath of the assassination of Abraham
                    Lincoln—a mood of vengeful anger and suspicion. Appropriately, Thomas Reed Turner employs
                    Melville's insights as the thematic thread for a carefully woven analysis of the public
                    reaction to that first presidential murder. The result is a refreshing corrective to a century of
                    historical distortion.</p>
            <p>Eschewing the elaborate conspiracy theories so often paraded by historians, Turner seeks to put the
                    events surrounding <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s death in their actual historical context: the "terrible whirlwind
                    of opinion" (p. 52), the public fury which swirled about the pursuit of the conspirators
                    and their trials and which led to the widespread conviction that southern leaders and wily Radicals
                    were behind the plot. To reach this goal he integrates "what is valid in the views of
                    contemporaries with what is valid in recently discovered materials" and thus places <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s assassination "in its proper historical setting" (p.
                    xiii).</p>
            <p>It is precisely in depicting that setting that Turner is most successful. With remarkable detail he
                    describes the manner in which John Wilkes Booth's pistol ball transformed the spirit of the
                    American people from one of exaltation at war's end to "despair rapidly turned to
                    anger and thoughts of vengeance" (p. 24). Under the impact of that shift, the government,
                    led by Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, pursued and captured the accused and brought them to trial
                    by military tribunals. These events are painstakingly examined in light of the rage and <pb n="193" id="VAA4025-079-2-091"/> despair which enveloped them. Half of the volume, for example,
                    demonstrates how bitter public opinion, reflected in diaries, sermons, letters, and newspapers,
                    affected the nature and results of the trials of such conspirators as Mary and John Surratt and the
                    celebrated Dr. Samuel Mudd.</p>
            <p>Woven throughout are fresh contributions to the historiography of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> assassination. Turner rightly scores historians for acting "as if the
                    assassination occurred in a vacuum" (p. 252), and his attacks on the conclusions drawn by
                    Otto Eisenschiml, Vaughn Shelton, and the sensationalistic <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>

                        </placeName> Conspiracy</hi> are clearly on target. In a revisionist spirit Turner defends the
                    much-maligned Stanton, showing how the war secretary, given the prevailing shock and fear, performed
                    both capably and judiciously. Likewise, he argues cogently for the appropriateness of military
                    trials as the "best means of revealing the full extent of the conspiracy" (p.
                    251). Though his treatment of these controversial subjects often seems belabored, such grappling
                    with the critical issues may compel historians to reconsider one of America's most painful
                    moments.</p>

                    </placeName>: Alfred A. Knopf, 1982. Pp. viii, 271. Appendix, notes, index. $16.95.)</head>
            <p>Dwight G. Anderson, who teaches political science at San Diego State University, has undertaken a
                    study of Abraham Lincoln with the objective of resolving the problem of the "two
                    Lincolns." He also hopes to provide "not only a better understanding of the man,
                    but a fuller appreciation of his impact on American political culture." The resulting
                    product is one that is difficult to define or categorize, for it contains, among others, elements of
                    political science, biography, historiography, intellectual history, literature, and psychohistory.</p>
            <p>Dividing his volume into four chapters, each subdivided further into additional units of varying
                    length, Anderson boldly and forcefully argues his position as he seeks to attain his stated
                    objectives. He insists that previous scholars of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> have not focused their attention closely enough on Parson Weems's <hi rend="i">Life of <placeName>

                    </placeName> that have been largely minimized or neglected. Indeed, the text of the Lyceum Address
                        <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-079-2-092"/> may be found in the appendix to his work, so crucial does
                    Anderson believe it to be for a better and more accurate understanding of the Civil War leader.</p>
            <p>Anderson examines <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s religious beliefs and practices, his obsession with death and dying, his
                    concern about immortality, and his moodiness. Little is offered that is new or has not previously
                    been studied in greater depth. Similarly, the discussion of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as the new <placeName>
                        <country reg="is">Israel</country>
                    </placeName> breaks no new ground. What is fundamentally creative is Anderson's contention
                    that a new <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> emerged from defeat, rejection, and despondency after 1854. The new or reborn <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> now sought to achieve immortality through a political career on the national level, an
                    effort which, if successful, could establish a new political religion for the nation. This
                    "new" <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> deliberately and calculatingly seized his opportunity with the development of the
                    secession crisis and subsequent conflict. Thus, Anderson argues, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> could now symbolically re-enact the Revolution and create the Constitution anew,
                    thereby superceding even George Washington as a "father" of his country. Indeed,
                    avers Anderson, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> rather than <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> has served as the model for such modern presidents as the two Roosevelts, Wood-row
                    Wilson, and John F. Kennedy.</p>
            <p>Anderson's volume is certainly stimulating, provocative, and challenging, but it is not
                    necessarily convincing. He supports his central thesis with a mass of evidence, as his copious notes
                    readily confirm. Yet one's credulity is strained to accept the picture of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> striving coolly and indefatigably to supplant <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to re-create the nation, and to overcome death. The persistence with which Anderson
                    repeatedly pounds home his elemental idea creates suspicion about the plausibility of his position.
                    Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to suggest that Anderson's treatise reads like a
                    legal brief, argumentative, overbearing, and on occasion stylistically infelicitous. Nevertheless,
                    he has provided, perhaps, another piece for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> puzzle, one which present and future scholars will need to consider.</p>

                    </placeName>. Charles B. Strozier, who holds academic appointments in both history and psychiatry
                    and serves as editor of <hi rend="i">The Psychohistory Review,</hi> rather describes it as a study
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s personality and character from an "avowedly
                    psychohistorical" approach; that is, one that employs "concepts from
                    psychoanalytic theory" in an attempt to identify the "real" <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> (p. xi). Lest that description put off potential readers, it should be said at the
                    outset that the psychoanalysis has been muted and the use of jargon carefully avoided. Indeed, the
                    occasional references to the speculations of Sigmund Freud, Heinz Kohut (to whom the author
                    acknowledges a special debt), and others often seem intrusive and gratuitious. For example, one need
                    not appeal to psychoanalytic theory to be persuaded that humor held a particularly therapeutic value
                    for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> (the point has been made many times), nor is it difficult to see that much of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s early behavior stemmed from a search for "personal coherence and
                    integrity" without knowing that that search made sense "in terms of psychoanalytic
                    conceptualizations of identity" (p. 35). At other points, the author's theorizing
                    appears less credible, as when he determines that the nine-year-old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> unconsciously explained his mother's death as a punishment for his
                    "earlier forbidden sexual desires" (p. 26). At such times, however, Strozier
                    alerts the reader to his own uncertainty through his use of highly tentative language. The
                    "real" <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he concedes, still remains obscure.</p>
            <p>Strozier offers a series of interpretive chapters focusing largely on the pre-presidential <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>: his childhood; his young manhood (including his relations with women); his
                    relationship with his father and with the Founding Fathers (in which the Lyceum Address is subjected
                    once again to scrutiny—why cannot the address ever be seen for what it was, a typical
                    Whig diatribe against the breakdown of order associated with romantic democracy and the dictatorship
                    of King Andrew I?); his continuing search for order through the law; his political rhetoric
                    (emphasizing his congressional term and the House Divided speech); and his qualities of leadership
                    (including his fits of depression and melancholia). Perhaps the finest of <pb n="196" id="VAA4025-079-2-094"/> Strozier's chapters is not on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> at all but on Mary Todd Lincoln, a sensitive, moving, compassionate portrait that by
                    itself will amply reward the reader of this book.</p>
            <p>There is not much that is new in these chapters, although devotees of psychobiography will probably
                    disagree. The story, however, deserves retelling, and by combining a scrupulous search of the
                    historical materials (the author's balanced and judicious use of William H.
                    Herndon's biography is especially meritorious) with a fluent, engaging style, Strozier has
                    done so with insight and feeling. The unifying theme, as the title suggests, is <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s quest for union, a private quest that ultimately merged with a public one;

                    </placeName>'s "private concerns found reflection in the country as a
                    whole" (p. 233). It is a theme with which few can argue. Nothing has been said of
                    Strozier's Chapter 8, "The Group Self and the Crisis of the 1850s," in
                    which the author attempts to place the American people on the psychoanalyst's couch. In his
                    preface Strozier warns the reader of its tenative and problematic nature and suggests that it might
                    even be skipped. In view of this disclaimer it hardly seems fair to comment upon it.</p>

            <p>Reading Dreiser's <hi rend="i">American Diaries</hi> is largely an exercise in frustration
                    for the reader who expects thoughtful, incisive, extensive comments on people, times, and the
                    author's own writings. The biographical scholar, however, who needs to know the daily
                    details of Dreiser's life, will get some satisfaction from the thousands of two-word or
                    one-line references to people met, places traveled to, restaurants visited, women slept with, and
                    work completed or in progress. The mass of atomistic facts and quotidian detail, impressive though
                    it is, rarely blossoms into insightful, articulate response that would reveal Dreiser's
                    personality.</p>
            <p>Two examples will suffice to define the problem. Since these diaries cover the years in which Dreiser
                    wrote <hi rend="i">An American Tragedy,</hi> one would expect interesting revelations about the
                    process of composition. A check of every index reference to <pb n="197" id="VAA4025-079-2-095"/> the
                        <hi rend="i">Tragedy,</hi> however, yields nothing but a disappointing collection of bare-bone
                    notations, none of which goes beyond "Working on An American Tragedy" (p. 350) or
                    "give her Chapter 17 of An American Tragedy to type… Finish chapter 18"
                    (p. 409). This procedure, incidentally, turned up one erroneous index reference to p. 453, which
                    turns out to be part of the list of emendations.</p>
            <p>The fifty-two entries under H. L. Mencken promise a bountiful harvest of information on the
                    relationship between these two major figures; but on the whole the pickings turn out to be rather
                    slim. The most interesting of the Mencken entries provides a mere glimpse of Dreiser's
                    attitude toward his friend: "Mencken is there with her sister and likes to have her stay
                    there nights when he is there, ‘for looks.’ The cautious
                    conventionalist!" (p. 169). As for the rest, Dreiser rarely goes much beyond the merest
                    mention of seeing Mencken or receiving a letter from him. In two instances, references to
                    "Mencken's book" (pp. 195, 205) remain unidentified by the editors, whose
                    glosses are otherwise informative, substantial, and clear.</p>
            <p>There are a few notable passages where Dreiser suddenly ceases to write in his usual truncated style.
                    These passages stand out both because they occur so rarely and because they immediately engage
                    one's interest and attention. For example, in his 1902–1903 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> diary Dreiser gives a moving description of being down to his last pennies, yet too
                    ashamed to enter a free public dispensary for medical treatment: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I walked to and fro, thinking of what they would and what I would say and then finally I felt
                            as if I had better not try it. Accordingly I started toward the city but when I got as far
                            as the bridge that spans the Schuylkill at Walnut street, I recovered my courage and went
                            back. When I reached the sidewalk opposite however a negro was cleaning the windows. I felt
                            as if he would know what I was coming for and so I strolled by again… (p.
                        95).</p>
                    </quote> The immediacy of this scene and Dreiser's focus on his emotions draw the
                    reader's interest far more than all the detailed chronological listings of daily events.</p>
            <p>In this sense, then, the <hi rend="i">Diaries</hi> is a book by scholars for scholars, rather than
                    for the general reader. It was put together by thorough and meticulous editors, who provide not only
                    an informative introduction and ample footnotes but also a sensible set of editorial principles,
                    helpful headnotes for each diary (there is, incidentally, a rather large gap without extant diaries
                    between 1903 and 1916), a mercifully short list of selected emendations, and a useful index
                    containing only a small number of detected errors (e.g., H. T. Coates &amp; Co. appears in the
                        <pb n="198" id="VAA4025-079-2-096"/> index as J. H. Coates &amp; Co., and the entry for p.
                    99 was erroneously omitted).</p>

                    Wayne E. Fuller. (<placeName>

            <p>In <hi rend="i">The Old Country School</hi> Wayne E. Fuller studies primary education in the
                    midwestern countryside during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The subject is a
                    promising one, and the author brings his considerable talents as a researcher and writer to his
                    exploration of it. Unfortunately, the merits of the book are insufficient to overcome its
                    simplistic, one-dimensional quality.</p>
            <p>Fuller's affection for the one-room schools of the midwestern past shines through on every
                    page. His sensitive understanding of the struggles of farmers, teachers, boards of education, and
                    county superintendents to create and maintain an educational system is remarkable. And the picture
                    he draws of the nature of the schools, their pupils, teachers, materials, and curricula is
                    outstanding. In Fuller's hands the one-room school becomes all of the things it was
                    supposed to be—a key community adhesive, a showcase for democracy, and a quality
                    educational institution.</p>
            <p>Fuller's championship of the one-room school would be admirable if it did not lead him into
                    a narrow and ultimately unsatisfactory analysis. Fuller is so determined to uphold the worth of the
                    little rural schools that he skirts questions about their quality by lapsing into special pleading
                    or exuding a haze of nostalgia. Too often he reaches conclusions which are unjustified by the
                    evidence, as is the case when he suggests that Indiana's relatively high illiteracy rate in
                    the late nineteenth century was attributable mainly to the fact that the township—rather
                    than the rural district—was the main unit of school governance. When Fuller discusses the
                    challenges posed by professional educators to the tiny districts and their one-room schools, his
                    treatment assumes the character of a morality play. The forces of good are represented by the
                    embattled farmers struggling to preserve their local jewels of democracy, and the forces of evil are
                    embodied in the professional educators whose motivation is explained primarily as a quest for power.
                    Recent scholarship regarding rural education and its <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-079-2-097"/> reform
                    indicates how simplistic this explanation is, but Fuller shows little inclination to consider
                    seriously evidence which might lead him to modify his views.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Old Country School</hi> addresses an intriguing subject, and it will be interesting
                    to readers who want to know how one-room schools in the Midwest operated or to nostalgics who find
                    those institutions romantic. Regrettably, historians will find little here which contributes to
                    their knowledge of rural education.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Healthiest City: Milwaukee and the Politics of Health Reform.</hi> By Judith
                    Walzer Leavitt. (<placeName>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Healthiest City</hi> pretends to be interdisciplinary history. Actually, it is a
                    curious juxtaposition of sociology and political science using the past as its locus. The first
                    several chapters focus on the demographics of Milwaukee during the late nineteenth and early
                    twentieth centuries. They offer all the fad and fashion of what practitioners call the new social
                    history. Statistics abound in this section, as do semi-jargonistic terms. Unfortunately, the numbers
                    and terms serve mainly to mask unexamined and unexplained sociological constructs and concepts. Such
                    choice phraseology as "lifestyle," "economically and politically
                    heterogeneous group," and "rapidly adapted to life in
                    Milwaukee"—each of which carries its own peculiar type of intellectual
                    baggage—litters the book with only the slightest indication of its utility, significance,
                    or even meaning. This sociological tract ends with two conclusions that ought to surprise few:
                    population density predicted mortality from many diseases, and curative medicine during the period
                    was less important (successful?) than preventive medicine.</p>
            <p>The political science portion tends to redeem the work. Leavitt does a rather thorough job of
                    outlining the conflicts, points of contention, and areas of agreement that comprised in Milwaukee
                    the politics of public health measures and legislation. Devoting specific chapters to smallpox,
                    garbage, and milk, and labelling each a test case, the author sets out the political tensions in a
                    turn-of-the-century American city. These chapters provide a detailed summary of the various disputes
                    and coalitions that both rocked and calmed Milwaukee.</p>
            <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-079-2-098"/>
            <p>Leavitt goes a step further, however. She not only asserts that municipal health activities
                    constituted a swapping of cultural identity for something she connotes as social control; she also
                    uses her test cases to develop a model of political decision-making in the public health field.
                    Clearly an attempt to unite the book's sociological and political science sections, the
                    model's inclusion seems a mistake. It exposes a basic flaw in the book's <hi rend="i">raison d'etre.</hi> Leavitt has argued both for the generalizability of the
                    Milwaukee situation as well as for its uniqueness on socioeconomic and cultural grounds. This
                    apparent contradiction produces a sense of uneasiness, for it does not seem possible to have it both
                    ways. As a consequence, questions emerge about the model's applicability and significance
                    and persist about the book's contribution to the literature of Progressive Era reform.</p>

            <p>Although not viewed as one of the great rivers of America, the <geogName>Green River</geogName> has
                    been significant in the history of western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. This river, which flows into the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> just upstream from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, has served as the channel of trade between the timber and coal country of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and the industrial <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName>. Agnes S. Harralson has lived all
                    of her life in the <geogName>Green River</geogName> area. This book is a collection of memories,
                    some from before 1900, and research on the river area that she obviously loves very much. It is
                    written in the style not of a trained historian but of one who wants to share with others a lifelong
                    interest.</p>
            <p>The book focuses primarily on the steamboats that at one time traveled the river. The author not only
                    provides the reader with physical descriptions of specific boats but also introduces him to the
                    operators and owners of the boats. The color of the showboats, the economics of the packet boats,
                    and the drama of shipwrecks are all treated in this book. But the book is not limited to steamboats.
                    The author includes sidelights and folklore of the <geogName>Green River</geogName> area. Among the
                    sidelights are sections on the unsuccessful attempt of a colony of Scottish coal and iron workers to
                    build an iron works at <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-079-2-099"/> Airdire, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, and on activities in the valley during the Civil War.</p>
            <p>Harralson's work is amply illustrated with pictures of the steamboats and of areas along the
                        <geogName>Green River</geogName>. The reader will find some interesting primary source material,
                    such as letters and interviews. One example is a letter written from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1854 (pp. 116–18), which provides a description of early <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and its <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> residents. This is but one example of information provided in the book about cities and
                    citizens of southern Indiana. The author strays from the subject at some points, becomes repetitious
                    at others, and uses nontraditional documentation methods throughout. However, the book does impress
                    upon the reader the importance of the river to the development of the region and does convey the
                    excitement of the steamboat era.</p>

            <p>Hans L. Trefousse, one of the most esteemed scholars working in the Civil War and Reconstruction
                    period—this is his seventh major book on the subject—has turned his attention
                    to "Mr. German-American," Carl Schurz (1829–1906). Schurz was born in
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rhineland</settlement>
                    </placeName>; took part in the 1848 democratic uprising while at the University of Bonn; engineered
                    the dramatic escape of his professor, Gottfried Kinkel, from the Spandau prison; fled to exile in
                            <placeName>
                  <country reg="fr">France</country>, <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
               </placeName>, and Great Britain; and emigrated to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1852. The existence of slavery in his adopted land and the 1854 passage of the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> Act motivated him to make common cause with the newly organized Republican party, of
                    which he soon became a prominent member (and a quondam defector). At his death Schurz was remembered
                    in Europe and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as a tireless advocate of the abolition of slavery, civil service reform, and tariff
                    reduction and an opponent of American expansionism in the Caribbean and Pacific. In addition, he was
                    certainly the most prestigious leader of both the ill-fated Liberal Republican movement of 1872 and
                    the successful Mugwump support for Grover Cleveland in the 1884 presidential race.</p>
            <p>Schurz's limitless energy, oratorical gifts, and journalistic talents, along with the
                    Republicans' need to win over large <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-079-2-100"/> numbers of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName>-American voters, involved him in every presidential election from 1856 to 1900. Indeed,
                    one of the main thrusts of this elegantly concise biography is the attention it gives to the ethnic
                    factor in nineteenth-century politics. Schurz's important speeches for national party
                    candidates Abraham Lincoln and Rutherford B. Hayes were reason enough to reward him with federal
                    office, but Trefousse makes the persuasive case that in every instance of political
                    favor—including his service as minister to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, secretary of the interior under Hayes—it was Schurz's perceived

                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName>-Americans that was decisive in getting him these governmental rewards.</p>
            <p>Some aspects of Schurz's life are relevant to Indiana. Before eventually settling in
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Watertown</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
               </placeName>, in 1854, he considered <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Two thousand Germans lived in one section of the city, and he considered it a positive
                    sign that "between noon and one o'clock it was possible to see six trains leaving
                    Union Station in different directions" (p. 51). During the week of March 7–14,
                    1860, Schurz lectured in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, complaining that "the trains were bad, the food worse" (p. 83).
                    Trefousse's masterly study profited from, <hi rend="i">inter alia,</hi> the extensive

               <hi rend="i">Battleground</hi> is the autobiography of Margaret A. Haley (1861–1939), a
                    founder and leader of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Teachers' Federation. Haley, who begins her autobiography with "I
                    never wanted to fight" (p. 3), concludes that she told her life story "with as
                    little of my own personality as is humanly possible" (p. 270). While she does not probe her
                    own psyche in introspective reminiscences, Haley's career reveals the character of a
                    combative challenger who eagerly fought entrenched financial, business, political, and educational
                    interests.</p>
            <p>When the smoke of battle cleared, Haley's major efforts <pb n="203" id="VAA4025-079-2-101"/>
                    were directed to: (1) uniting classroom teachers in a single organization that would not only
                    improve their working conditions but also improve <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s public schools; (2) forcing an equitable and realistic assessment of
                    corporate property that would generate revenue adequate to finance <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s schools and teachers. Her drive to organize teachers along union lines
                    brought her into conflict with the educational establishment not only of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> but of the nation. The struggle to force reassessment of corporate property brought her
                    into conflict with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s vested financial and political interests.</p>
            <p>During her life of struggle, Haley had few heroes or heroines. She was loyally devoted to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Teachers' Federation President, Catherine Goggin, and held Ella Flagg Young, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> School Superintendent from 1910 to 1915, in deep esteem. Others, particularly those who
                    compromised, she unmercifully cut down. She scornfully rejected Jane Addams as "gentle
                    Jane," an ineffective member of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Board of Education who was too weak to stand up for principle. Leading educators such
                    as William Rainey Harper, William Torrey Harris, Nicholas Murray Butler, and many of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s school superintendents were attacked for opposing teacher organization.</p>
            <p>Although involved continually in complex local and state issues of tax reform and property
                    reassessment, Haley was not parochial in outlook. She was able to place the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> educational situation in the larger national scene. Haley's attitude and
                    temperament reflected the political and educational progressivism current in the twentieth
                    century's first three decades.</p>
            <p>Robert L. Reid demonstrates editorial competence. His long and balanced introduction creates an
                    interpretive biographical framework for Haley's autobiography. His explanatory footnotes
                    identify the persons and issues mentioned in Haley's narrative. Despite Reid's
                    good scholarship and editing, Haley's commentary on her life is unsatisfactory as
                    autobiography. The total portrait that should appear is missing and obscured by the detailed
                    complexities of legal maneuvers, legislative lobbying, and political stratagems. A well-done
                    biography that provides a more finished portrait of Haley's life, career, and contributions
                    is still needed.</p>

            <p>There is a growing body of literature on the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century experience
                    of blacks in such large cities as <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>,
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>,

               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but much needs to be done on Afro-Americans in smaller urban places like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Topeka</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Thomas C. Cox has attempted to meet that challenge in his study, the first monograph
                    of its kind.</p>
            <p>The author contends that despite social and economic differences the blacks of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Topeka</settlement>
                    </placeName> were not separated "into competing interest groups on matters related to race
                    advancement." An active black press "facilitated communication and a rich exchange
                    of ideas within the community and apprised Negroes in the city of the condition of the race in other
                    locales." The cumulative effect of "institutional, social, economic, and political
                    development… as well as media for internal and external communication, gave the community
                    effective means of exercising some control over its own destiny" (p. 197). Hence the black
                    experience in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>'s capital city "was not a case study in urban pathology."
                    Black Topekans "could depend on institutions and ideas, forged over the previous years, to
                    chart their course into an uncertain future" (p. 198). <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Topeka</settlement>
                    </placeName> blacks were relatively better off than blacks in many other communities because they
                    were "less proscribed by caste in their dealings with whites" (p. 164) and were
                    more politically conscious, the result of "a high literacy rate, an informed press, and a
                    zest for political action" (p. 185).</p>
            <p>Although Cox is conversant with recent writings on blacks in late-nineteenth-century America and has
                    done extensive reading in relevant state and local primary sources, he is less successful in
                    convincing the reader of the validity of his thesis. The subtitle, "A Social
                    History," is misleading, for the author seems to focus on the thoughts and deeds of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Topeka</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s black leadership, not the black community as a whole. For example, little is
                    done with the mass of statistical material on population, occupation, and family organization
                    provided in the appendix—and for some inexplicable reason data are not provided beyond
                    1895. One would think that the 1900 federal population schedules, aggregate census reports of 1900
                    and 1910, federal Negro population data of 1915, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Topeka city</settlement>
                    </placeName> directories could have been used here. Especially limited is <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-079-2-103"/> Cox's treatment of what Mary Berry and John Blassingame, in a
                    recent study of black America, term the key components of black society—the family and
                    the church. Surprisingly little is written about the origins and functions of black churches (or,
                    for that matter, about the black clergy of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Topeka</settlement>
                    </placeName>). Family authority and organization are virtually ignored. Patterns of occupational and
                    residential mobility among black Topekans, whether studied in the aggregate or as individuals, are
                    not seriously explored. The decline of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Topeka</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s black population (from a high of 5,024 in 1890 to 3,874 in 1915) is not
                    systematically examined.</p>
            <p>Particularly surprising, given the author's heavy reliance on black <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Topeka</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers for news and editorial opinion and his assertion that its thirteen
                    newspapers reflected and enhanced the literacy of black Topekans, is the scant attention to the
                    histories of these newspapers. (Only three lasted more than two years, and only one, the <hi rend="i">Plaindealer,</hi> lasted as long as twenty-two years.) How were those papers founded?
                    What sort of circulation and financial support did they have? How and why did they cease
                    publication?</p>
            <p>The author, moreover, does not examine in depth the interrelationship of black and white Topekans.
                    For example, the reader may find questionable the glib assertion that those white Topekans who
                    assisted blacks (e.g., pp. 56, 156) actually did so for purposes of social control. The relatively
                    free access which blacks had to the white community of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Topeka</settlement>
                    </placeName> also makes questionable the frequent use of the concept of caste, which connotes
                    rigidity in social relations. Accordingly, the argument for a unified and resilient black
                    community—even despite divisions of opinion over the advice of Booker T. Washington on
                    dealing with second-class status—is unconvincing. Much more seems to have been happening
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Topeka</settlement>
                    </placeName> between 1865 and 1915 than is discussed in this book.</p>

            <p>This atlas has been prepared to assist teachers and students engaged in the study of history and
                    geography. The various kinds of information gleaned from the maps and accompanying texts also will
                    interest general readers and others, <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-079-2-104"/> including economists and
                    sociologists. The volume contains a wealth of material.</p>
            <p>At first glance this is an impressive work. The maps fall into ten categories: location; physical
                    base; discovery and settlement; population; government; politics and social characteristics;
                    transportation and communication; economic activities, including mining, agriculture, manufacturing,
                    and commerce; and towns and cities. All told, 113 maps with brief texts present a myriad of facts.
                    Both the maps and texts, however, must be used carefully as some of the sources consulted are
                    outdated and some of the information is either incorrect or questionable.</p>
            <p>Works of this tremendous scope frequently contain some flaws, and this volume is no exception. For
                    the uninformed a definition of "cuestaform" and "fragipan" would
                    have been helpful. Maps, in most instances easily understandable, on occasion include communities
                    that are not mentioned in the accompanying commentaries. People who reside in the county seats of
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Marion</region>, <settlement type="city">Randolph</settlement>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> will be surprised that the author accords that governmental designation to other
                    communities. A similar surprise awaits the residents of Rich Fountain, Loose Creek, Luystown (not
                    Lustown, an example of numerous misspellings), and Frankenstein when they discover they live in Cole
                    County. Historians will question a number of assertions: among them, that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> may have been the first white settlement in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>; that Daniel Boone actually worked in the salt licks in the Boonslick Country; and that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>

                    </placeName> side of the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>. While the atlas could have been
                    improved through the use of more up-to-date sources and more thorough proofreading, it still remains
                    a valuable and informative reference work.</p>

            <p>The latest two volumes of Grant's papers cover a critical period of his military career. The
                    aftermath of Vicksburg's capture, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>

                    command, and the first month of his contest with Lee are among the important subjects.</p>
            <p>Simon continues to handle his material with admirable skill. From autograph dealers'
                    catalogs to obscure biographies of minor generals, he has collected Grant's writings,
                    sometimes finding only excerpts of documents. He identifies all copies of those documents and lists
                    their locations. Material from the <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi> is included, and discrepancies
                    between the published and unpublished versions are noted. Simon uses extensive footnotes to print
                    endorsements by Grant that do not fit well into the text of the <hi rend="i">Papers.</hi> He also
                    uses the notes to quote, oftentimes very extensively, from documents containing information
                    pertinent to textual material. Very few personal letters appear in these volumes, but official
                    papers sometimes contain personal information. Most of the documents are taken from National
                    Archives files. A "Calendar" at the end of each volume contains more Grant
                    endorsements and letters to the general.</p>
            <p>After fifteen years and ten volumes, Simon has taken Grant less than halfway through his public
                    career. His exhaustive annotation is the cause. He adds almost no editorial commentary, but the
                    documentary notes at least double the space devoted to the text. At first glance, one wonders if
                    this is necessary. Those doubts are dispelled on close examination. What keeps the <hi rend="i">Papers</hi> from being a pedantic exercise is the flow of documentary information on the
                    problems Grant faced and the decisions he had to make. Simon has provided scholars with a command
                    study, or at least the material for such a study, that will continue to be one of the most important
                    primary sources for Civil War military historians for a long time to come.</p>

            <p>Having babies is one aspect of history about which the "how" is known, but not the
                    "why." The basic problem is why the fertility of American families fell so
                    drastically in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Maris A. Vinovskis casts his inquiry
                    far more broadly than his narrow title suggests. He <pb n="208" id="VAA4025-079-2-106"/> examines
                    the availability of farmland, the shortage of men, the growth of towns, the rise of industry, the
                    spread of education, and even the psychological dynamics of individual modernization. Only the last
                    two factors appear important in his sophisticated statistical analysis. Vinovskis relies largely
                    upon aggregate census data for the state as a whole and for its towns. Although he refers to the
                    numerous family reconstitution studies that have been undertaken for colonial <placeName>
                        <country>New England</country>
                    </placeName>, he tends to distrust them on methodological grounds. In other articles he has used
                    samples of individual families taken from the manuscript census files, but he makes little use of
                    them here. As a consequence, he must infer individual behavior from aggregate data—always
                    a difficult procedure, and in this case one that leads to inconclusive results. While the emphasis
                    is on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, Vinovskis is always ready to make comparisons with the rest of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, with Europe, and, with an eye to policy, with developing countries that today are
                    trying to reduce their birth rates.</p>
            <p>Indiana experienced much the same pattern of fertility decline as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, though with a lag of several decades. In 1810 the Indiana frontier had the highest
                    fertility in the country, perhaps the highest in the world. By 1890 the state had converged to the
                    general pattern of northern states. The state was still largely rural, nonindustrial, and
                    incompletely "modern" in the values and outlook of its people. An adequate social
                    history of the people of the state will have to explain this pattern and its consequences for family
                    stability, outward and inward migration, and social mobility. The work of Vinovskis on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, of John Modell on Indiana, of Richard Easterlin on farming areas generally, and of Don

                    </placeName>, has not solved the problem. However, these individuals have articulated the
                    theoretical and conceptual issues and, especially in this book, clearly explained the difficulties
                    and opportunities involved in working with census data, demographic models, and the statistical
                    techniques that must be used.</p>
